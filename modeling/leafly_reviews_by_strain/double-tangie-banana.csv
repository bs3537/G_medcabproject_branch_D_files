Slightly tingly and dizzy, but that passed petty quickly. About a half hour later, the sativa kicked in with better focus. It helped with fatigue and nausea quite a bit, and was very uplifting. Nice daytime strain.”"

However, I would not say this is a daytime strain. I am a seasoned heavy smoker and this strain kicks my ass! It's what I smoke to go to sleep at night. The high is a heavy body stone, with total couchlock. I smoke it when I have migraines and it subdues the pain and allows me to sleep.”"

Some cottonmouth and dry eyes, but not as bad as other strains. Gets less energizing and more calming in higher doses, but still no couch lock.

It worked great for me, but it might not be that way for everyone. My girlfriend smoked some too and she got really paranoid from this strain, so it's not a winner for everyone.”"
Zuffler,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/double-tangie-banana/reviews/1773529,"“If you ever have a chore that is both mundane, repetitive and boring, such as packing boxes ahead of moving house, this IS the jam! Energetic, clear headed and creative. Smells and tastes like skunk should, leaves and lovely fruity taste after a good toke. Well worth a 1g punt if you're curious.”"
fxdednick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/double-tangie-banana/reviews/1728252,"“Gives you a great high. My whole body feels relaxed. And my mind is at ease. Great strain to smoke after a long day.”"
AlicaInWonderland,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/double-tangie-banana/reviews/1714552,"“Love this strain. It’s a great wake n bake to start the last day before a long weekend. Up and alert while still maintaining some chill. I generally like all strains with banana lineage... but you could more accurately say, “I like all strains” ;)”"
Sassybigblue,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/double-tangie-banana/reviews/1730655,"“I tried this for the first time in shatter form and WOW was this strain DELICIOUS!!  
Not only did it taste good but it was very uplifting and talkative. I’m all about the taste and I can’t stress enough how good this strain tastes.”"
reviewmaster,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/double-tangie-banana/reviews/1679624,"“Gives me a killer headache but the smell is very intoxicating. It reminds me of the tangie obviously but an improved terpene profile. Taste is also very nice, as it is slightly sweet and orangey.”"
Dawnlpenich,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/double-tangie-banana/reviews/1516065,"“I’m diggin’ it! It tastes like horse manure, but in the best way possible. I mean, I’ve had a few ciders and a lot of dabs this evening, but I feel confident in my palate. Makes me feel like I wanna sway back and forth or side to side to some Hank Williams guitar solos. Anyway.”"
liriloop,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/double-tangie-banana/reviews/1411908,"“As the introduction of this strain asserts, double tangie banana is perf for flavour enthusiasts. I can taste the sitrus flavours, but only a hint of banana if you concentrate.
The high on the other hand, it felt kinda mellow, not very high. 
Over all I feel lucky I tasted this strain!”"
