cookie63luv,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/ultra-sour/reviews/1365571,"“I love the cerebral effects and how it makes you feel joyful and creative. I love how it took my worries and obsessions away from me. I however didn't like the insane munchies and dry mouth it gave me but other than that this is a chill blend. I'd definitely recommend it if your anxious and depressed”"

JoseyLissie,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/ultra-sour/reviews/1569109,"“This happens to be one of my favorite strains. It never fails to get me started at the beginning of the day. Gives me the boost needed to make it through the day. Keeps pain at bay while keeping you moving. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners due to the extreme energy rush. Some may feel an increase in heartbeat due to its potency. But it's great for veteran smokers like myself. Once you get used to it, you'll stop...”"

Dragon37,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/ultra-sour/reviews/1746339,"“Nice strain. The high rolls in fairly quick and nice. After a time it rolls out. Felt contented. I had dry eyes and the munchies but that’s minor. Great wind-down after the workday.”"

uby94,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/ultra-sour/reviews/1753573,"“Recently been trying some sativas since I usually prefer indicas, which isn’t very helpful for being functional in the daytime. I have a pretty high tolerance but a couple cones of this stuff made me almost uncomfortably high. I have anxiety and too much can make me feel and act a little paranoid but I’m not too worried compared to it’s other benefits. Great for doing stuff or doing nothing, depends how much you smok...”"
