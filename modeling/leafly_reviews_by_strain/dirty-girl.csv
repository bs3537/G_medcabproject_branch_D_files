No, it's plain-jane girl at the back of the club sipping a Mojito and wearing glasses that were never in style. The same one who invites you back to her place -- and two hours later you're ...”"
mkate,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dirty-girl/reviews/1411009,"“Currently my number one daytime strain. Decided it should really be called "clean the whole damn house girl" as I find myself cleaning behind the refrigerator or in other generally untouched spots in my home. The best parts: no anxiety, no munchies and no slowing me down.”"

NettieBlue,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dirty-girl/reviews/1368980,"“Possibly my favorite strain of all time. I bought it the first time I went to a weed shop, so it has a special place in my heart. This hybrid is the perfect balance between relaxation and creative energy. It erases anxiety and gives a strong feeling of euphoria. Food is amazing, but it doesn't give you the intense munchies of an indica. It also has a sensual side when you may need to clench your eyes shut in pleasure...”"
LiviLoves420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dirty-girl/reviews/1369182,"“This one is very interesting. Intense mind high. Overall very stimulating. Gets me so amped up I am wide awake. Very focused, if you smoke too much however you can become paranoid. It's very refreshing and different.”"

Ultimate86Man,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dirty-girl/reviews/1508162,"“She is worth the smoke, as she is an anti-depressant with 1/5 of the energy of Durban Poison. I would say the energy is much like being at a Pep Rally in High School (get high bro), my point is that you will become motivated with a clear enough head buzz to realize you got Euphoria and the Bud is a dry eye free so far! I will definitely give this one another try if Durban is not available.”"

Heavy and relaxed, great before bed. Smoked it next to a waterfall, totally chilled with that waterfall for an hour. Then i had to walk up 10 flights of stairs and a hill. That wasn't great, but the fact that i COULD suggests that this strain is not too restrictive.
4/5 Waterfalls.”"

Flower - SPP

All around a great strain. it all has amazing flavor and a noticeable head change(Sativa). The SPP Growers feel they have light indica high. The most recently tried by SpoilD is GOLD and melts like sweet honey. a must try.”"

I love anything with Cinderella 99, but there's something about DG that just... vibes on my vibe. I get a big ol' smile, chatty, somehow relaxed but excited to see everything. I have a tendency to get anxious on some sativas (sour diesel / green crack / sometimes cinex), but never with DG.

reyashtoos,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dirty-girl/reviews/1233193,"“"Dirty Girl" was not highly recommended, but different growers have different results, just like different vineyards produce different tasting wines.  That said, despite the mention of lemon and candy given in the generic description, I found the taste harsh.  On the flip side, it got me veeery stoooned.  It made me feel the way Cheech and Chong act in their movies.”"

Tastes very earthy like others have stated, a very small hint of citrus...something, but mostly earthy and piney. Smooth smoke using a cheap hammer style bubbler, I'm sure it would be amazing through a decent piece. Very uplifting, awake, willing to do things. Nice hybrid in the sense that you do feel some of the effects you would expect from an indica (heightened sensation from touch, ...”"

BakedDragon,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dirty-girl/reviews/1182175,"“Taste wasn't sweet like the description says, at least not for me. It was more earthy to be honest.

I tend to favor Indica's so that was a pleasant surprise I didn't expect. Slightly rough coming down, felt drained. Strong cotton mouth
Great for night time use in my opinion”"
tylertho89,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dirty-girl/reviews/1293470,"“One of my favorite strains. Mellow uplifted high. I felt energized. Great flavor. High came on gradually and was not overwhelming. Great for social situations. Great daytime medicine. I deal with anxiety and this strain did not induce any what so ever. I am considering weening myself off klonopin. If I continue to find strains like dirty girl.”"

It smoked smooth out of the preroll, and hit incredibly fast.  Very quickly, though, I went from happy and chatty to stuck in my own head having to remind myself that the thoughts I was having were MJ induced.  I was incredibly paranoid, and really, really trapped inside my mind.  The high lasted for well over 4 hours, and that wasn't even...”"
despejada,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dirty-girl/reviews/1292031,"“It's a very good sativa.  Great for outdoors.  The only reason I cannot give it five stars is that while I enjoy great highs with this strain, I also became very anxious and somewhat paranoid.  I"ve tried it three times now (different settings) with the same results.  Something not quite working with my brain chemistry with this strain.   Anyone who tries it and doesn't have those side effects is in for a treat!”"
