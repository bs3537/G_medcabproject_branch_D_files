It's definitely not my personal favorite and I wouldn't buy it again but it's a good high, not too racy. Thoughts can get tangled and messy and it quickly becomes annoying. I would say it's probably best for when you're already in a calm state of mind. I wouldn't use it to get "happy" like a lot of other hybrids.”"

When high I felt great, good body high but once I came down and especially the next day I felt horribly anxious! It's happened every single time. It's done the same for my husband as well. If you have anxiety, stay away from this strain!”"

I was originally getting Skywalker OG, but changed to this last minute. TBH I have never heard of this strain before. I mean Headband x Sour Diesel x OG kush, how can u go wrong!??! Yah that was what I thought so I bought an oz, big mistake. I'm not sure of the THC content but I'd be willing to bet it's not that high.
