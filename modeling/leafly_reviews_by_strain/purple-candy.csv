bayareabud420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-candy/reviews/1411149,"“The Candy Purple I am sampling at the moment is very good.  The buds are beautiful, bright green mixed with deep purple viens and patches.  The tips of the buds seem to be the most purple area, generally being completely purple.  However, other nugs are bright green and have no purple at all.  Each and every bud is completely caked up in trichs, some incomprehensibly frosty at the tops.  Overall, it is truly camera f...”"

I've recently decided to give it another go because I'm having a lot of difficulty treating insomnia, anxiety and depression in myself.

I picked up Purple Candy as a way to counter insomnia. After coming down from a few hits of Pennywise in the afternoon (great strain, by the way), I vaporized some Purple Ca...”"

It's smell pine and slight berries. It's taste is typical to many good kushes from the west coast, sweet and earth. After taste and smell is hashish like with a hint of berry. The buzz is mainly physical and p...”"

I just love the sweet fruity stuff so this was right in my wheelhouse. Pretty to look at, incredible smell and tastes even better. Only $140/oz! Score! Definitely a daytime fave for me, reminds me of shishkaberry back in the day. Kept me percolating for 3 hours of just a few pulls off my Solo. Will fo s...”"
gramworth,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-candy/reviews/1502295,"“This strain gives the flavours and effects I've been looking for as a daily smoker. Smooth as hell, allowing me to take bigger hits at once getting me to where I need to be mentally much quicker. The nugs are coated in trichomes and orange hairs, with very deep purple and bright green hues throughout. One of my favourites for sure, and is a Canadian treasure.”"

Until the menu lacked something more popular, so I grabbed some. Normally use the bong an papers. Didn't notice any sweet flavour in the bong. But 😁wow twisted up this a VERY tasty strain.

TheHappyCanadian,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-candy/reviews/1364424,"“To me, this is what Indicas are all about.  Total relaxation with a soothing head to toe tingle, and the complete distortion of time as it passes.  Definitely gives couch lock, but also didn't knock me out (which is great for me, I like to enjoy my high and not just sleep through it).  It doesn't hurt that this bud smells and looks amazing, and vapes beautifully.  Candy indeed!”"

JungleManDan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-candy/reviews/1346546,"“Nice dark green bud with hints of purple and that candy crystal coating. The taste is like the most unhealthy, sugar filled grape juice you've ever had. Doesn't come on strong but will last and leave you passed out if you get to comfortable. Expect pure mind drifting bliss as the couch lock sets in and your eye lids get heavy. Highly recommended for those with insomnia.”"

AnjaPorphyria,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-candy/reviews/1625023,"“Purple Candy is a light, easy to smoke, and well rounded strain. I smoke this when I've had a stressful day, I just sit on my deck, take in the ocean view, and queue up a show on Netflix. I find that I tend to cook when I smoke this strain, not sure why, but I do. Great strain for beginners, 10/10 would recommend.”"

JD3RR,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-candy/reviews/1334145,"“This strain has a very sweet taste, not so much that of candy. More that of a fruit gummy! 

This strain is a great sleep strain, but it does cause some morning grogginess.

All in all, good to get to sleep, not the best for waking up.”"
