ChubbyCheddah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1397755,"“A cannabis connoisseurs dream.
The beauty of this lady sets her apart from other strains. she has beauty, power, charm, bag appeal, and too top it off, she smells incredible! Don't call her a bitch, cause she hits hard, and she won't hesitate too sit you down if you don't respect her power. She is of high standards and quality. She comes from an excellent family, Her parents are top shelf and both can hold their own ...”"

The smoke is smooth and complex. Enjoyable all around.”"
HerbeHeureuse,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1392491,"“To reward myself for going to the gym and taking a killer hard Spin class I went to the dispensary across the street from the gym and picked up 3 new to me strains, just one gram each.   First I worked out my lungs, and later I charred them with White Urkle.

White Urkel is an indica dominant hybrid and the parents are Purple Urkle and The White.  It smells wonderful!  Wafts of sweet earth pungently assuage your nost...”"

bdubyah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1463666,"“So fucking relaxed right now after smoking a half joint of White Urkle. My son is watching Minions and yelling at the TV pretending to be their leader. He’s also got his diaper half off with half of his ass hanging out. Normally this would bug the shit out of me because I know my night is gonna end up with me cleaning pee and/or poop off of the carpet. But I’m so relaxed right now that I just don’t give a shit becaus...”"

fopodilf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1412010,"“Man this strain hit me like an edible. Full effect takes a little while but it's total rubber spine euphoria. Buds are small and super dense with great aroma. Probably won't make it to the grocery store after a few bong rips.”"
kanna37,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1317494,"“One of the best damn highs I've ever had.  This strain is amazing, and it's now one of only three strains that I actually stockpile every month.  Balanced head and body high, and it made my mood disorders completely vanish just as wonderfully as it brought my inflammation and pain from Osteoarthritis down to the point where I felt normal for the first time in ten years.  If you need something that works for pain, moo...”"
darthgnard,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1412011,"“Amazing relaxed feeling, everything just calms down but you also have energy enough to do stuff. A great muscle relax without the couch lock.”"
MaxEmmo1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1317789,"“Love this strain. I wish I had more time to enjoy it. I combined this with Flo throughout the day. Zero issues with White Urkel by itself. I used it for several days in a row.”"
DetectiveBabyLegs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1449409,"“White Urkle is the perfect sleeper. The strain profile says almost nothing about effects but buckle up boys and girls. It smells amazing, the effect is heady, while also packing a crazy, powerfully heavy body high. Be careful and go slow this stuff can sneak up on you.”"
xblackrobx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1413545,"“Sis in law flowed me a heavy gram just now and dayum...not reading leaflys guide yet, I'd say the high is similar to GSC, maybe sunset sherbet...I'm functional and locked at the same time. back pain gone. future's rapping/mumbling makes much sense to me now. I could go for a jog, but why? esp when it's 105° at 2130...let's play some Diablo 3 instead.”"
NolandEpic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1256147,"“White Urkle was very relaxing. A strong head buzz hit me hard and fast, followed by an all over relaxed feeling. This strain diminished anxiety and pain for me. I felt mentally clear, even as a nice couch lock settled in. The high lasted about 30 minutes.”"
Ankush22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1273704,"“is a great smooth organic bud, I feel like I can inhale all the buds vapour instead of coughing which I am accustomed to. Smooth piney taste that makes this a great choice.”"

nishiys,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1674942,"“I'm still a relatively new smoker, and suffer from panic disorder, but White Urkle has definitely been a favorite so far. Its calming effects are amazing. I don't get dizzy or am in my head too much. It just makes me happy! And another bonus that I've just discovered is pain management. I broke my leg last week and had to have surgery. I've only been out of the hospital for 5 days, but am limiting my use of oxycodone...”"
sammybelle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1253112,"“Having tried a few urkle crosses, this is one of the best. Dense purple glistening nugs. The high is strong and pure indica. Relaxing and sedative while uplifting and euphoric. Great all around body high. Flavor is some sweet berry with earthy spicy musky undertones. Got it at Serra in Eugene. Will definitely get it again”"
SeatownHaze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1216292,"“Got a fat joint of this and it's very nice. Smokes smoothly and without harshness. The perfect relief for whatever stress you may have.”"

StirdyDirty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1301270,"“I absolutely love this strain. One can definitely feel the indica inside of this glorious hybrid. This is the kind of strain that you can smoke at the end of the day, even after a day of smoking, and still feel the relaxing effects. White Urkle is a great strain to have when you have nothing to do and just want to sit around with some friends on the back porch and some good food.”"
zoefeuer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1563731,"“Major Pain relief... my body buzzes after one hit. And I’m a chronic pain patient with a collapsing pelvis ( not fun.) 

This stuff is potent, but blankets you in a calm euphoric haze. Mentally, this is a great strain for depression and anxiety. Due to its stabilizing but uplifting effect upon your mental outlook. 

Highly suggest trying this one home alone on a Sunday afternoon. Great for introspection. Reading, tv,...”"

It hits the head slightly to strong (I guess it depends on amount/ person's chemistry).  And sooner than later turns into a very strong mostly body hybrid feeling.

Effects are chill and relaxed, but not to the point of a couch lock.  Vapour is smooth with hints of citrus and peat.  Very earthy and rich smoke.”"

silasbotwin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1176322,"“Used this strain as a wake and bake bud, but that is a huge mistake cause you won't get up and be active for about 2 hours after you finish smoking. The purple urkel indica is expressed as a thick body buzz with a tingling behind the ribcage, and the white is expressed as a roaring cerebral high sativa, I definitely am impressed with this cross of 2 potent strains!”"

ultrapop,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1313247,"“Picked his strain up for the daytime burn and I have to say it's quite a treat to smoke! Very flavorful and grew out some thick dense buds leaning on the indica side of things. As for the flavor it's got fruit notes and the high settles into the front of your head. You need a good sharp stone style grinder for this type of flower quite dense. Overall I would buy this again”"
popsst,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1318068,"“Very relaxing yet non-drowsy high accompanied by easily amused happiness. Very talkative and heady but with a stoned feeling such that I wouldn't use this for going out or in social settings. 

The indica side is not noticeable by doesn't hit with the hard withdrawal into my head, sleepiness, and couch lock I experience with some hybrids like PGSC. Instead I found myself understanding things in minute detail, very en...”"

Best nights sleep of my life. The high makes me feel couch locked but still giggly... Such a good combo. I enjoyed watching TV and then when it was time to sleep I passed out. Munchies weren't too bad either, which is good.”"

I remember liking it at the time.

It tasted delicious but in a strange and mysterious kind of way.

It made me feel good but it probably isn't my favorite.

Nicely balanced and pleasant for a hybrid.”"

RyanLhud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-urkle/reviews/1289631,"“I feel mixed about this one. bought it on special a few days ago. It's superrrr dry, crumbles like dead leaves when I load a bowl. many sun bleached leaves. I can get a pretty good high after I smoke a few bowls but it doesn't last too long. pretty decent taste/smell. Thinking it was just a bad/old batch. Might try again, definitely have had worse bud than this.”"
