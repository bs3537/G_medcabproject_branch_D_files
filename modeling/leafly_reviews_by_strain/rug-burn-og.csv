savannaray,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rug-burn-og/reviews/1171294,"‚ÄúNot bad, it had a good amount of a head high and gave me moderate munchies. It didn't knock out pain like I had hoped though.. Decent strain, may be good for people who need to carry on with their day, since it didn't give me couch lock.‚Äù"

GREEN420BELIEVER,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rug-burn-og/reviews/1336674,"‚ÄúRugburn O G is actually quite amazing the effects are uplifted happy an relaxed, if smoked during the day you really enjoy an have a productive fun day.  if smoked in the evening you have a great relaxed buzz that can put you to sleep.  very few strains can  adapt like this.  one of my top 5   next to ( death star og,  pineapple express, Alien og, holy grail kush). happy smoking and tell your mom I said "Hi"‚Äù"
