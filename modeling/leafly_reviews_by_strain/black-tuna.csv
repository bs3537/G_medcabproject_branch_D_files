Black Tuna
=============
5StarOrganic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1415449,"“If you are a weed virgin and someone pulls out a can of Black tuna  you have one of two options:

1: Smoke Black Tuna and get so *%^@ high that you most likely vomit.

2: Wait for a weaker strain so you can have a fully appreciable smoking experience.”"
hgds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1390090,"“You take a waft and think black tuna, why would they name it that? After rolling the joint and smelling a kushy yet odd flavor you light it up to take a hit. You are hit immediately with a thick, bellowing, luscious smoke that may leave some coughing. You get the sense that this smoke tastes nothing like tuna, yet you might name it the same. The effects are immediate. A focused and exceptionally euphoric high, this c...”"
nagchampa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1324936,"“Black Tuna is a godsend!  Tremendous pain relief within minutes, both when vaped & smoked, and all but the worst & most persistent chronic pain areas felt almost pain-free for hours.  After a good night's sleep I awoke feeling refreshed, pain still at low levels, and hungry rather than nauseated.  A segue to: BT also quelled my nausea (gave me not overwhelming munchies, but enough to eat dinner & then hit the cookie ...”"
Gordon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1068300,"“This is by far some of the cleanest medicine I've had the pleasure to smoke in a long while. From presentation it looks very dark and skunk like but once you get a glimmer of light on it, you'll see what's actually there. It pretty much turns white once you get a a glimmer on light on it. This is some strong stuff, definitely will halt you from going on with your day and will put you to sleep. Also the service at 5 s...”"
Steved333,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1352886,"“Tilray patient review. This is by far the most perfect bedtime strain I have tried yet. Nice mellow euphoria that also relieves body pain and anxiety. Makes you feel tired and ready to go to bed with just a little bit of vaporizing. Only need a small amount to get the desired effects.”"
ActualFactual,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1380530,"“If getting high is your goal, 5 stars.  This is a "takes no prisoners" strain that'll hit ya topside the head like a sledgehammer good and fast; it keeps you high - can get you higher - and seemingly doesn't stop likely due to its Lambs genetics (Sativa with strong "alert and awake" features).  The sleep on this strain takes a while to kick in, comes well AFTER the bulk of the buzz.  Hits 100% top speed immediately a...”"
CaptainKhan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1068299,"“Out of the strains I've tried from most of the bigger dispensaries in BC this is by far my favourite. Great, long lasting intense body numbing stone that will stop you from going on with your day. Great for pain relief, sleep and plain old laughing your ass off. Great strain from great growers. Well done 5*”"
karlsaleh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1501536,"“My God. By far the strongest strain I've tried, and my entourage seems to agree. Definitely not something to smoke on your first time. But if you are experienced and looking to get very high for like 3 hours (and then just ordinary high for another 2 hours), you're gonna LOVE this one. It pretty much had a psychedelic effect on me the times that I smoked it.”"
Blue0wl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1274215,"“I've just started smoking again after many years of being a non-smoker. I'm very prone to anxiety and depression, I was curious if marijuana would provide relief. Small doses of Black Tuna helped depression without doubt, insomnia was flat gone… I don't feel it helped with anxiety, but it did not seem to aggravate symptoms. Nice smoke (mild) and mood enhancement.”"
greengoddess70,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1331815,"“I love Black Tuna's soulful hit. I sleep straight through the night and wake feeling relaxed and well-rested with this strain. While I've read that it's a good appetite stimulant, I don't find it as appetite-stimulating as some other strains - a bonus if you watch your weight. A nice strain to keeping the frazzles at bay.”"
Aceteria,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1393738,"“This is a great strain. Black Tuna is a a very great smelling, better looking flower. It's Skunky aroma immediately  hints toward a heavy high. If looking to mellow out and relax, this is a great choice for those looking to just lounge, but in my experience, it's also great when on the move. I would advice against novice smokers. 

Great day!”"
jonutzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1393737,"“Very good bud! The smell is perfect, sticky, and it's very potent for normal smokers.”"
valagra,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1278945,"“Bought under the name "Tuna Kush" but in BC and it matches the descriptions. 

Incredibly impressed with this strain, the vaped taste is pungent, buttery and rich just like the scent. Feels like getting in a hot tub once it settles in, muscle pain becomes tingly and light, manageably drowsy head. Not for begginers, very high THC. Very uplifting and energetic descending into potato calm. Everything takes longer to get...”"
TheHappyCanadian,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1381272,"“This is a new favourite.  I love the relaxation of a solid indica and the euphoria and creative focus of a good sativa. This strain combines both beautifully into a unique Cannabis experience. My buds look decidedly underwhelming, but a couple of bowls in the vaporizer and I was the highest I've ever been on pot (at least that I can remember!). I experienced one of the most relaxed body highs I've ever had, in combin...”"

519banger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1353817,"“Probably one of my current all time favorites, Black Tuna is a beautiful potent strain that kept me climbing and on my toes. The magnificent aspect of this strain would have to be it's chameleon characteristics, meaning it's ability to act as both sativa and indica. After smoking half a joint, I was elevated. My anxiety was crippled, my muscles relaxed. I was able to get a long walk in, and the couch lock held me tig...”"
OGEEK,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1324724,"“When I first opened the bag of black tuna, I was hit with a blast of its strong odor. After picking up a bud and examining it, I noticed right away the black in this strain. Hence black tuna. Very dense and sticky. I vaped the same amount as I usually do and can tell you this is a very heavy hitter. It also creeps up on you very slowly. Very sedated but yet calm and relaxed. Didn't bother my anxiety. Great strain, pe...”"
jpjak,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1510072,"“If there's one way to describe Black Tuna it's potent. This strain is not for beginners. One B-rip left me stoned out of my mind and gave me easily one of the best body highs I have ever experienced. Highly recommended for those with chronic pain issues.”"

sonh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1353816,"“Black tuna presents a narcotic sedative medication that relieves any difficulty you may have with sleeping. What makes it such a versatile strain when medicating, is also the ability to function and getting things done during the day. This sticky, skunky and not to mention bag appeal bud is no joke. It's smooth inhale with a nice powerful exhale. I find it a great medicine for my personal use. I would recommend this ...”"
ADinhTran,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1167002,"“Love this strain. Starts off like a sativa, keeps you going and ends like an indica like 30-40min later.”"
Corijo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1223114,"“I was expecting fishy smelling Cannabis from the name, but it is not that way at all...if smells fresh and clean.

Sort of feels like a two-stage hi, the first half hour you’re just in a haze, a very fun happy haze ... then it settles into a consistent high that lasts probably about six hours. 

For me personally I feel like it’s a great strain when you’re alone and before bed but probably not the best for high energy or social scenes. Definite...”"

Call me crazy but I just don't trust anything that was once a fish and is now a can on a shelf. This however has zero tuna smell or taste. It's a potent bud from the great white north, great for evenings or right before bed. Strong THC levels make this a favourite for myself. Very strong body high melts away any pain or stress that you m...”"
Kolendo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1274216,"“While this is a nice night time strain, I don't think it deserves a 5/5 rating. I was most impressed with the level of mental clarity I was able to maintain despite the heavy sedative effects I felt. The smell is dank and the buds themselves are beautiful, coated in crystal with very visible little orange hairs. Put me to sleep within an hour of first vaping!”"
mattny,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-tuna/reviews/1368854,"“Very relaxing and stress relieving, sedating but still functional. Good for stress, nausea, appetite and in higher doses, winding down for a good nights sleep.”"

Very enjoyable smoke & I found is tastier each time I smoked. Very pretty bud, moreso when using a camera flash but this picked up on just how much crystal it has and its exotic dark purple tinges. Taste is very earthy/woodsy with mild citrus hints. Mine was called 'black fin tuna'.”"
