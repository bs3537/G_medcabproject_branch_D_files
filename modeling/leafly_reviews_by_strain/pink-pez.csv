=============
MacMage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-pez/reviews/1378717,"“Light fruity, citrus notes; smooth, deep hash background. Block out some personal time, the Express is going to roll through your mind. You'll love it, just like I did. Powerful appetite stimulant.”"

marchpumpkin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-pez/reviews/1062353,"“New favorite for short term pain and stress relief during the day when I need my head as clear as possible and to be able to focus on my work.”"
megamanv3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-pez/reviews/1378718,"“Fantastic mental high, but not that much of a buzz. Really paid attention to the details of what was happening, and was able to watch whole episodes of NOVA on end, remembering large parts of it word by word. 

Sorry for terrible pic.”"
Thomach,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-pez/reviews/1275283,"“Heavy head rush but after several minutes it does tend to cool down into a very relaxing body high. Stress melts away efficiently which is a nice plus too.”"

When ever another budd was not to my liking or to dry I mix some pink pez in there just to give some consistency when rolling or fast when toking! Favourite mix was pink pez with pink #1”"

DurbanAssassin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-pez/reviews/1279217,"“Comes on like a Mack truck possessed by the devil. Totally heightened every sense (especially hearing) and sun sensitivity. Made me pretty anxious too. Also brought on a bit of paranoia but I'm not used to sensory overload like that. More research required. Amazingly after an hour or so it 
balances out to a really, really mellow high.”"
