I can function at a high level, it resolves my nerve damage pain in my head from multiple strokes and it is an uplifting strain. The smell is super skunky and not subtle in any way. Don't think you can smoke this without it accidentally becoming your new perfume or cologne.”"
Shattx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-peel/reviews/1392450,"“Doesn't quite taste like bananas like you'd hope, but it definitely has a good organic feel to the taste. Definitely recommend for a slow, relaxing high opposed to taking a hit and instantly feeling peak high. Didn't make me feel too tired any of the times, but definitely wasn't super energetic either. 

Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a calm relaxing night of relief!”"

Great head high that isn't distracting, good body high that took my lower back pain from a 6 to about a 1.5. Great effect for PTSD, very uplifting and no paranoia!”"
