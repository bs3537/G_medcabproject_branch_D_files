Fat buds whose naturally pale mint color is washed into almost ash white by a thick layer of crystals. Snowy orange hairs wrap around distinctly lilac purple, and cool pink patches.  A prismatic beauty.

Scent is a wonder. Grapefruit, and citrus, with grape, and mixed berry one is reminded of any neon colored fruit candy.  Once its had time to air, classic earthy indica flavors can be ...”"

Almost immediately after smoking this I felt very dreamy and relaxed. After the head high came down a bit my mind felt focused and ready to go. The only problem was my body refused to cooperate. The head is ready and willing but the body just wants to chill and hangout.

Kind of a weird duality....brain creative and ambitious but the body, well it just wants to remain in place. I guess I would re...”"

Effects start with a gentle but invigorating uplift cerebral spark. Mood improves and makes you feel very positive.
After that, your body will melt easing all pain away.

The first noticeable effects were calmness, a very very light pressure around my eye sockets / upper cheek bones. Some gentle pressure at the base of my skull / top of my neck. 

As a medical patient, I can only speak to the effects in lower quantities.”"
