The smoke does expand in the lungs, it comes out thick, the smoke is very smooth and not harsh on the troat at all,The high comes on very fast, it is very strong! do not plan to smoke this before work, you will not be able to function that way, it makes you very spaced ou...”"
noisyturtle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1282942,"“Good genetics in this strain makes it nice for relaxing. It's got a sour-sweet diesel scent, and tastes sweet with mellow smoke. Great for pain relief and mood but will definitely slow you down. Perfect for some Saturday afternoon video games.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1588197,"“This strain has every thing going for it; the potency, the aroma, and the uniqueness.

I picked up a half gram of shatter from Nature's Medicines in Phoenix, best $15 I have ever spent. However it's that kind of shatter where it's brittle & hard to stick to the dab tool. You can't even squeeze it into a little ball it just breaks down into almost chunks of sugar. Despite that down side this stuff is so potent I only ...”"

FWC has it labeled as a Sativa, so I tried it. I smoked one joint and started doing some research on ol’ JC. I found that it’s lineage is STACKED with indica relatives. No wonder I felt kind lethargic after about 10 minutes of head high. I’ve believe that the JC I received is more like a 70/30 indica-dom hybrid. It’s not what I expe...”"

Indica3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1511512,"“Another $8 dollar strain that I got my moneys worth and then some. It was full body relaxation and so much so I may have taken a few extra days off of work just to recharge my batteries and gain literally 15lbs in 4 days. It is a good one up there with GG and Yoda OG. My spine and from my head to my toes were completely numb and pain free while my appetite was somewhat insatiable it was a great strain and highly reco...”"

After that it was magical. Feeling a total mind trip very happy, free and idealistic. Awesome smell and taste. Totally recommended”"

skinnyhb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1294014,"“wow what a surprise. usually the reviews are a little hype for me, and the product falls short of expectations, but not here. spot on reviews for overall feelings, this is great with Netflix or people and conversation”"
Ienjoymarijuana,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1256578,"“Great strain, in my opinion it is a very relaxing but heady high, feeling happy, a bit spacey. Good for enjoying your favorite movie and or shows.”"
Jayfeather,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1333694,"“One of my all time favorite strains. It hits you extreamly fast. By the time I got back to my room from my smoke session, I was already gone. The smell is rather enjoyable for someone who likes the outdoors. Overall a really enjoyable and relaxing mind high.”"
ballin420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1312889,"“very euphoric and relaxing. hard to keep a straight face. Great high. would recomend. powerful in a good way. great stuff.”"
Knocturnal_Knight,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1367510,"“New cannabis user here, so I've only tried a few strains, and so far this one is the best. I noticed it's sweet, almost perfume-like taste, which I enjoyed. Then noticed it's euphoric, relaxing effects. I felt happy and very relaxed, but not sedate. Wanted to be out and social. Definitely a good day high. Will probably be a favoritive during summer!”"
noellethediva,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1348765,"“I am reviewing this strain in the form of concentrate, specifically Moxie's live resin.

Already a moxie fan, but this is a standout even amongst their premium extracts. In budder form, the flavor has a very distinct topical fruity taste to it - and a high equally as pleasant. This is a mood lifter. But the flavor....seriously it's amazing. Will pick this up anytime I can find it.”"
Floyd999,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1061912,"“Great and strong. Smells and taste good. At first i felt a bit paranoid and anxius. After a few mins it was magical, i felt so free, happy and euphoric. One of my favorite highs. Must try”"
floyd09,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1135117,"“My favorite strain ever

IllnehZ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/julius-caesar/reviews/1190748,"“This is one of my favorite hybrid strains. The high is extremely cerebral and psychedelic, with an additional slight muscle relaxation. It is a very strong and intense high. Would not recommend it to beginners.”"
