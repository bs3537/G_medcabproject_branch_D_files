Cannajokefox,https://www.leafly.com/indica/karibbean-mango/reviews/1663595,"“So most the information is wrong on here about it.

10 week strain but would do better at 12.
More sativa because if the skunk in it. 

Triples in stretch. 
Gives a great yield. Usually the highest. 

Actually does smell like mangos. Could be frostier though. 

Chill high.”"

Buds are strong and full and hard.”"
