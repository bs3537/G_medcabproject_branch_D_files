Lemon Haze
=============
TerryWallace,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-haze/reviews/1416312,"‚ÄúA definite favorite of mine, in the top 3 out of all the different strains I have tried.
The buzz was quiet long, but I didn't have that much so it could have been much longer. It went down so smooth I would gladly swap this for air if I could. And to top it off, it tastes amazing.
There are not many strains better than this one, with everything positive and it cured my depression, lack of appetite and pain.

Not only is it similar to Jack Herer in that regard, but it also shares the wide-eyed vision. Although...instead of Jack‚Äôs soaring euphoria, this is more beaming cheeriness.

sometexan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-haze/reviews/1416119,"‚ÄúI've never been truly ''depressed'' but like others emotional pain hits us eventually. Lemon haze lasts around 2 hours for me with great physical and emotional pain relief. No stress or Sadness. Incredibly happy throughout the entire high. Wonderful taste as well. A sudden lemony taste then a great grapefruit after taste. I give this a 10.‚Äù"

acrazypers0n,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-haze/reviews/1417454,"‚ÄúThe flavor and smell are what won me over at first, but even the high from it was damn good. It didn't leave me completely stupid and I was able to hold conversations and comprehend what people were saying. Lemon Haze is one of the few strains that can make it difficult to walk in a straight line. It's also really sexually arousing. Like..very. Which is fine because it doesn't make you go stupid or lazy.‚Äù"

After a while I felt really creative and a big wish to discover and read articles about all what popped into my mind.
Another day I smoked it and then went to a City Museum. This weed made me feel really "Cultural".
A bit of Anxiety just after I smoked it, but after I went to the toilet to Poo I felt much better.‚Äù"

Happy, giggly and motivated, this herb gives a good manageable high. Taken to excess, my brain was buzzing, burning, feeling confused and anxious. Regular hits give me focussed and happy sanity rather than the box of howler monkeys trying to pass for my brain.‚Äù"

Jaybird23,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-haze/reviews/1388424,"‚ÄúA decent strain. Good to go to for a change from your regular favs. I found this strain to be similar to Sour Diesel. It made me excitable and goofy. Forgetfulness and tiredness were the side effects. Didn't really get too much dry mouth like everyone's saying. Not a bad strain, but not a regular smoker.‚Äù"
GodKingApollo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-haze/reviews/1346138,"‚ÄúA burst of lemon in smell.  Beautiful flowers dense yet light and fluffy.  Awakening to the mind and senses this strain is best enjoyed with morning tea or breakfast to start the day with an energizing burst.  Smelling the flowers prior to enjoying the smoke is key to activating the full aromatic potential.  The strong notes of lemon invigorate the mind to be alert.  Gets the appetite activated.‚Äù"
