I am a normal individual working a well paying job, but I have serious stress and anxiety issues that I refuse to go get drugs from the doctors, so before I went back to my state I decided to give  it a shot. I told the budtender what I needed (Something that is energetic and has stress relief) he gave me...”"

I was so happy on this strain that I studied , called family members I usually wouldn't call and had endlessly beautiful conversations with friends. BTW IM A 8 year straight LA smoker.”"
myleaflyaccount,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-goat/reviews/1417853,"“The golden goat high is quite distinctive for me. It has three distinct phases:
1) the come-up, which is extremely energetic and creative - you will want to move around, talk to people, or get started on/complete a project you're supposed to be doing
2) the peak, which is euphoria. It isn't a sativa-like rush, more like a sudden realization that this amazing euphoric feeling has been building and you just feel real...”"
willir97,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-goat/reviews/1413179,"“Smells of mangoes, lemon, and pine. Has a sweet and fruity taste. Provides an energetic high with a non-couch-lock head to toe body buzz, resonates feelings of contentment, happiness, and creativity, and is very uplifting. Great for biking, walking, meditating, listening to music, and enjoying the outdoors. Relieves symptoms of depression, stress, and is great for pain.”"
pulsepush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-goat/reviews/1409886,"“Very nice sativa. I say that because I don't get the bouncies from it. It's muted happiness, a calm reckoning of self and direction. I say burn this when you're really having a shite day/week/month/year it will lift you up, dust you off, and send you back into the fight with a fresh perspective. I smoke to benefit ptsd and depression and would recommend this to anyone seeking a mood lift. Just burn and take a long wa...”"

The Golden Goat has to be one of my new favorites, and I recommend it to anyone who can get the correct genetics. The flavor is fruity and top notch, and the high is absolutely top shelf. the nugs were medium sized and pretty dense, also quite stanky.

It smells sweet, floral, cotton candy like, and it also has a gentle "pine tree" scent dimension.

Fedient,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-goat/reviews/1382641,"“Wow!!! I think I've finally found the perfect sativa. GG potent (25% thc claimed) gave me the perfect high. Motivated, creative, energetic, happy yet able to maintain. I was able to actually get "stoned" without increasing my anxiety, in fact reliving it.  This is rare for me. One good hit does it for me, so it's economical as well. A+ strain in my opinion.”"

This strain is citrusy, absolutely delicious, and smells like it tastes. It's a clean high, doesn't drag you down at all but, at least for me, it's very relaxing. Golden Goat is euphoric, happy, makes you feel calm and capable. Added plus, the comedown is great, no hangover feelings.”"
