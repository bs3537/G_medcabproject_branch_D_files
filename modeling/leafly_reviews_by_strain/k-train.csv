StonerStig,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1350642,"“I love the pain relief without the crash. I don't know why it's categorized as an indica because it is definitely a hybrid. anyway, great strain overall”"
Mastrom12,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1414097,"“K Train will make your senses go wild and your body beg for more. It smells of spice, orange, sour, and citrus with fresh coffee undertones.  This is some serious medicine and will provide the user with a head numbing, body thumping experience that will make them happy and uplifted. As a medicinal user i find this strain ideal because it lasts a solid 3 hours and stops pain and stress, increases appetite, and decreas...”"
TimothyTV,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1165447,"“A very good bud indeed, K Train has now aquired a special place in my heart, as this is the first time I've smoked a Kush joint. Would recommend ideally taken in the evening before bed or before dinner, whatever you prefer. Speaking of, one thing I noticed was that it didn't make me as hungry as cannabis usually makes me. It's not like that was a buzzkill or anything, just noticed that and that was my personal experi...”"

Happy Dayz -”"
ptsd1981,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1245881,"“A soft, almost sweet taste, with the aroma of fruits with a woody aftertaste

K-Train hits quickly. It's equal parts relaxing and energizing. I feel it first in my fingers and my nose, a slow, warming feeling that seeps throughout the whole body, before settling like a circle around your brain. It's perfect for a good movie with family or an engaging candlelight conversation with your spouse before heating things up ...”"
Yellowazn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1245882,"“My opinion very good indica. strongly on the pain relief. Enormous pressure to lay down, Sleep and Eat. in a weird way uplifting.  I had a bad day and it doesnt matter. easily top 10.

Girlfriend ( say it  f@ck her up. in a good way.)”"
dj xclaim,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1065934,"“Wow what a strain..Trainwreck x Kush... Beautiful as hell to start off with.. great heady fast strong body high, with intense pressure relief in my joints and relaxation. overall it made me quite lethargic and sleepy but worth it for what i needed

It hits fast, and it hits hard. Stoney on the body, confusing and trippy on the brain. A truly powerful smoke.



i feel like i just got hit by a K Train.”"

moontime1981,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1147827,"“trainwreck lite with citrus...  It's only lite compared to trainwreck though.  It's tastey and relaxing. A great med to help with pain without knocking you out.”"
hawkgirll669,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1150473,"“spicy shit! smells spicy tastes earthy and spicy!  mixed it with some UK cheese. called them poppers. get hit with that cheezy aroma and earthy spicy combo! blam! toasty.”"
ChronicHighAF,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1340534,"“An amazing strain! Has a great taste. The kush itself is nice and compact. 
Let me give you and example:
1:Rolled up
2: went outside
3:didn't get home
4:wanted more
5:repeat”"
AndrewIsOdd,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1065946,"“Excellent, one of the best tasting and most pain relieving strains I've ever tried. Not the most energitic buzz though.”"
Big_nixgga_bird,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1729536,"“Idk but I’m high asf on this and it’s amazing I love how it’s making me feel so happy I really recommend this strain”"
wassafax,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1515731,"“WARNING: CLEAN YOUR PIPE BEFORE BLAZING THIS. THIS ISH IS TOO DELICIOUS NOT TO.

On the serious side of things, though,the citrusy of this strain is delicious. I enjoy trying to taste the strain and see if my taste buds are aligned with leafly's, and I think the citrus-like taste of K-Train is one of the most obvious ones out there. So good.
The mental buzz is good aswell. Helps me concentrate and work a while or pla...”"

If you can find it, buy it! You won't be disappointed. I'm old and falling apart and I can still get a good nights sleep, great MMJ.”"

tristan....,https://www.leafly.com/indica/k-train/reviews/1190416,"“Easy to grow, huge harvests.  As the genetics imply, it's a train wreck that is more stony because of the kush. Very smooth relaxing, heavy, but not too heavy.”"
