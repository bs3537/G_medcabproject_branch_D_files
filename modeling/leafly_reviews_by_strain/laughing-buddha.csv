This is one of those strains i tend to keep quiet about when im discussing weed with my friends lol

Its like my dirty little secret. I first tried this in Amsterdam. After 2 days of non stop smoking i was getting to the point where i was all weeded out and a lot of strains where just tasting the same and making me feel the same.

But not this.

I vividly remember sparking up a nice joint ...”"

This strain is a laugh inducing machine compared to most..well maybe it helps that I had Rick and Morty on.

If you smoke mainly Indica this Sativa will give you an adventure time urge. Even if that's just to the backyard or porch!

Mid range high 1 (1/2) - 2 Hrs, mellow finish.


Flavors: Spiced black rum,Sweet under tone, Earthy finish.

Tender...”"
ianguedes,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/laughing-buddha/reviews/1395898,"“This is one of the best strains I ever smoked. Earthy and nutty taste with a flowery aftertaste.

It has dense buds with rose like flowers. Sticky with crystals and amazing aroma, when you grind it!

Extremely social, gets you excited and talkative.

Gives a really nice head high and makes you slightly numb. 

Strong and long lasting, not for people that are not used to smoke.”"

It is my favorite so far.

Depression, stress, anxiety... Buh bye!

Very high CBD for such a strong sativa.

Taste: I don't remember what it tasted like but I remember liking the flavor.

Perfect for doing yoga, or going on an adventure!! (As long as someone else is driving).

Its funny how after dark it eased my anxiety and made me paranoid at the same time.  Example: I was walking down a d...”"
