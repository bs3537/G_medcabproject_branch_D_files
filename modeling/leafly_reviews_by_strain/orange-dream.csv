Orange Dream
=============
TensionHead,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1378185,"“This is just really uplifting stuff. Bottom line. A phenomenal option for social situations, especially compared to all the other strains I've tried. I believe the appearance is supposed to be very tight, small, dense, angry nugs with a light, orange-tinged color. And let's not forget all the RED on this bud... What makes this a favorite of mine is how good it makes you feel... doesn't matter what you're doing, reall...”"
TensionHead,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1378187,"“This has become a new favorite strain of mine. Very unique scent that is sharp and citric, but an extremely smooth smoke. I mean it's really smooth. Once the intended effects had sunk in, I noticed many similarities to a pure sativa due to the energy boost it gives; its qualities are perfect for those who like to be productive and those want to start their day with a smoke. Overall, a similar experience to last time,...”"
flyingrobots,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1378188,"“Tasted great in the vape. Very citrusy, almost like lemons. Also tastes a bit like sweeter herbs (rosemary?). Great uplifting high, made me feel happy and energetic.”"
lanziotti,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1370844,"“Very relaxing and uplifting”"
OrangeDreamer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1378186,"“This was the first strain I ever tried, and it was just really nice. Really fun, smooth, and it doesn't take much at all to get high. Loved it, if I can I'll have it again.”"
ReeferOfSouls,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1319926,"“I got some organic outdoor from a BC mail order website. Great deeply relaxing high. Perfect for middle of the day or at night. The buds were totally triched out which is no surprise as BC often has some  pretty amazing quality outdoor. The taste was a little citrusy with strong earthy sweet overtones. Definitely a good anytime of day strain, but a little too much will certainly put you on your ass if used in the mid...”"
hish_allam,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1370847,"“The buds are dense and coloured , the taste is wonderful woody citrus and vanilla , 
The smoke is smooth .
It's definitely a Sattiva dominant happy and dreamy and doesn't knock your body down .
For everyday use and morning or night but I prefer mornings .”"
shortfiction,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1348755,"“Just took two hits of this because I wanted to remain functional. For the most part, this really takes the edge off. I feel more peaceful, things seem better, life is more vibrant, etc. I'm not getting much of a body high, so I can still function. However, I seem to get easily distracted and lose myself in thoughtlessness. Very mellow. In small amounts, it's good for getting on with your day and making it a little mo...”"

wellheythere,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1351697,"“i've never smoked orange crush before, so i can't comment on how well it preserved o.c.'s best qualities, but, speaking as a blue dream devotee, i was impressed with this strain. beware of violent munchies and spaciness, though. also, the taste and smell are delicious!”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1069806,"“Over all, I really enjoyed this strain. I was very stress relieved and in a great creative happy mood. I could definitely feel the sativa when I wanted to draw but the indica came in when I wanted to get up and get my art tools haha. I was also able to have a clear enough head to talk to friends and ingage in a conversation. I did pretty dizzy and had a numb toungec but anything to be really worried about.”"

Samonegnap,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1378189,"“This has been my favorite strain thus far. The taste, the feel, the smell - all perfect. I definitely appreciated it when doing homework as well. I actually remember smiling while writing s paper. I was so relaxed, very happy, and I definitely wasn't in too deep of thoughts. I love it!”"
Anonybuddha,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1207091,"“Light, citrus, uplifting smoke. Smaller dense nugs coated in light orange hairs. Citrus meets flowery tea scent, quite intoxicating to my palate. Fairly potent if just seeking a smaller energetic high. Higher quantities may elicit spacing out effects. Careful, may cause happiness!”"
Gralfus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1261795,"“Tried "Orange Dream" last night. 2 vape hits at 350F. Maybe a slightly orange-oil scent to the weed. Breathing out it smelled more like a fuel. Took about 15 minutes and started feeling it in my head first, then like a slight aura around the edges of my body, similar to Blue Dream. 

Got a few closed-eye-visuals fairly quickly. I went and lay down in a dark room for a while and the erotic fantasies took off running a...”"

AlfredtheBear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1370846,"“A very nice, uplifting but mellow buzz. Great taste from vape (orange, vanilla). I'm a writer and got really inspired with the help of Orange Dream.”"
savagehippy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1250105,"“Pretty good strain not the best but certainly not terrible. The smell is real earthy slightly pungent and a hint of orange peeks through a little. The flowers are frosted, dense but still loose and fluffy so they're pretty big. The high is good quite euphoric head effect and real relaxing body sensation makes happy and giggly uplifted for sure. Had a headache too seems to have melted away. The flavor is pretty good e...”"

MiamiMax,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1287696,"“This strain was very interesting! It had great taste,the high was that of a great sativa but added a nice dose of indica couch lock. Citrusy and sweet. Id sure buy again!”"
BigDabbyStrain,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1583399,"“Walks on the jersey boardwalk getting Kohr bros. creamsicle ice cream cones...that’s where my orange dream went! Amazing taste profile with orange citrus and vanilla hints combined with those sought after sativa effects and orange dream is truly just that! I am partial to anything flavored orange so it would be really hard not to love this strain. Smoking my desert baby!!!”"
AndreaLynn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1143023,"“Extreme relaxing strain with a moderate head and body high .... Depending on your mood .. Depends on this guys satisfaction .

Probably wouldn't do it in the morning because it hits like an indica with the "couch lock" effect as well as the alertness of a sativa. Tasted great, smelled great too! Perfect Netflix marathon strain, just keep the liquids nearby for the thirst!”"

That when you do take this it will sneak up on you. In small amounts you will feel sleepy for 10 to 20 minutes and then have huge amounts of energy like you have just woken up from a nap and had 4 coffees and a red bull. However take large a...”"
Lank47,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-dream/reviews/1307481,"“Grabbed some of this at The Green Front and found it to be more of a balanced hybrid vs sativa dominate. Looks amazing with light green calyx's and dark reddish almost brown pistils. Pepper, Pine, and Citrus hits my nose with a punch while flowery notes of blueberry fill my pallet on exhale. I find my head is uplifted in the clouds but not quite euphoric while my body wants to stay planted in the Lazboy. Pain and str...”"

Great for going out with friends or just going for a nice walk . I found it hard to stay focused but it was easy to let go and have fun . If your prone to paranoia I don't suggest this strain . But if you are already a social butterfly and like having fun this is defiantly the strain for you . Great taste too.”"
