Nice bag appeal, I could smell it through that bag, it was hard & very crystal covered. When I ground it up the terpenoids really let loose & the whole room smelled of sweet, flowers!

First this batch seemed very sativa dominate which is good for me, the sweet smooth taste is a bit surprising, but it is sweet. The buds were well done, in all the proper methods.

Compact tight beige nugs with tints of blue are caked in trich. Hairs are scarce, small, and reddish orange. Smell is weak of sweet sugar and wood. Smoke is light and had little cough to it. Great for a social setting as it didn’t give me anxiety while enjoying a deep conversation. Somewhat happy but not overwhelming. Felt it in the back of my ne...”"
