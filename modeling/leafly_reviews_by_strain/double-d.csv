I think the only down fall for me is I get a headache after use of this more than any of the other neg.  effects, but its worth the good pounding down there for a little up there later.”"
jlsscbs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/double-d/reviews/1159277,"“A real nice strain that seems more like a Sativa than an Indica. Great for daytime use in moderation.

Even though it seemed to energize me, when it was time to go to sleep, no issues... indica properties seem to hit later... after an hour. Perhaps one of the best strains I've found for bedroom aerobics and naked lawn darts! Overall, I would give it a 9...”"

Because it impacted me more like a pure sativa, I didn't believe that it was in actuality Double D.  I didn't so much enjoy the flavor of this strain but gave it 5 stars based solely on it's high. It hit me hard and fast. Like nothing I've smoked before. Long lasting racing stoned. no impedement on cognative functions. ...”"

flipndip187,https://www.leafly.com/indica/double-d/reviews/1235515,"“Got a bunch of this. Was alot like your old school stoned out budn amplified by 1000. They were all perfect little crystal covered buds. The smell was earthy and dank. Not a distinct smell like alot of buds now. The taste was similar, earthy dankness with some sweet notes. Definetly a nice bud to chill back on a sunday with, not great for getting things done.”"
