Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-pebbles/reviews/1336415,"“This is a Strong Sativa High, similar to Snoops dream. Comes on fast,.like guzzling a coffee. Feel uplifted and happy, and seemed to lighten my vision like psychedelic mushrooms can. Eyes feel a bit weird. One hit is perfect...last time I pushed it with this strain, and was having to fight off the feeling of being on a rollercoaster. took a couple hours to feel normal. take it easy”"

Smoke this stuff just before work to deal with chronic body pain. Plus it gets me going, focused, and most of all enjoying the shit I don't want to do! Haha This is great for my social anxiety and all other stress/anxiety. I would highly recommend this strain, not only for the high, but it tastes like Fruity Pebbles. Weed and Fruity Pebbles?! Now that'...”"

My doc gave me some roids, something athletes aren't supposed to take, to see if that would ease thevpain, not at all. This strain after 2-3 hits, my pain is gone and I feel so relaxed but not sleepy at all. This strain is good for patients with pain, cramps, headaches and stress.”"

Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-pebbles/reviews/1210925,"“Strong medicine, in some ways reminded me of a blue dream like strain. Herbal and fruity smell. Happy,  talky high, hard to keep a straight face. first two hits went smoothly...probably shouldn't have had a third hit from the bong. I was so high, I had to duck my head under passing satellites. see "Himalayas", www.Soundcloud.com/the-high-chameleons”"

apkelley93,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-pebbles/reviews/1604297,"“5/5 top notch strain for wake and bake and daily consumption. has a wonderful fruity/sour/pungent smell that is very pleasant. smokes well and is on the stronger side so if your tolerance is low I wouldn't suggest more than 3-5 tokes of a bowl. only roll it up if your looking to smoke a joint and go on an adventure thru the woods on a nature walk”"
