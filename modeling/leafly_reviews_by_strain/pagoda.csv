Pagoda
=============
islandgrownOG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pagoda/reviews/1324173,"“Pagoda is my new go-to sativa leaning hybrid. She smells like funky melon, seems totally immune to powdery mildew and shakes off botrytis. 
Super lanky growth but nice moderately dense nugs for a leafy sativa. 
Smooth, tasty smoke. Tropical fruit and Chemdawg taste. 
Great full bodied high! Mind lifts off and body relaxes. Seems like there is no ceiling or burnout! Two-three bubbler bowls has me ready to move around ...”"

I have major lower back pain from arthritis and an injury from Ju-Jitsu....I'm doing my yoga everyday and trying hard to strength out my spine but I've been in pain for a long time. Some days I can not stand for very long. 

So I've been hunting for a good strain that takes the pain away and keeps me relaxed but not lazy. This strain feels "flexible"...”"
