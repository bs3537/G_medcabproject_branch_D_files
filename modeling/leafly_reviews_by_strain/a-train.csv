A-Train
=============
StrawberryTech,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-train/reviews/1354421,"“This is probably the 4th strain that I've tried since I got my prescription and man, it is the first to really bring me back to the high I remember from the 90's when I was using this in my teens... I got absolutely giggly to the max, and definitely wasn't stressed about anything. Fun one for the afternoon/evenings for me...”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-train/reviews/1064625,"“it is a good strain I believe and I must say I ate food to an incredible degree all last week because all last week I had the A Train. I found also that I was seriously horny lol. But I have been more stoned and for longer times. I smoke daily but still this is a new strain for me and I was hoping for a little more punch. Nice taste though.”"
isdo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-train/reviews/1064652,"“This has recently become one of my favorite mid day/evening/nightly vapes. I'm not a huge Sativa fan, and this brings the Sativa punch of Trainwreck, with the pain control and sedative qualities of Mazar. 
It has the classic taste of Trainwreck with a really pleasant underlying hash-y flavor.”"
Puffalo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-train/reviews/1280931,"“This strain gets me going like choo-choo and "I think I can...I think I can."   It's a really driven and powerful strain. I get the intense high, sharp eye visions with brain buzzin' at best.  A-Train is more of a recreational than medical bud to me. It uplifts my mood a bit too tense for my symptoms but I like it a lot after the high comes down to a plateau.  I would buy this for the winter day blues.”"
isdo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-train/reviews/1064651,"“I love this hybrid for low key evenings with a couple small sessions and a longer one to unlock the Mazar narcotic like qualities for the sleep.”"
Trapt1nw0nder,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-train/reviews/1064626,"“beautiful tight nugs, and a pleasure to grow.... so stinky, and definitely under rated strain, that needs to be on everyone's radar, and grown out at least once.... If I would compare it to any clone only out there that I have tried, it would have to be Socal Master... But not as strong, but this one definitely has more of a psychoactive effect, and is a creeper that will take you through a long dark tunnel of a mind...”"

Second hit the high hits you straight in the head. Flavors I tasted were piney, citrus, and wood. Great to listen to music too🔥”"

patrick.conover.3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-train/reviews/1064627,"“One of my favorite strains, not because of strenght but the type of sativa high. Not saying its not strong because its very strong, the high is just different and last a while.”"

Of all the strains I have tried so far this is the only one to cause lots of anxiety and paranoia for me. The benefits of the high, hunger and slight arousal, felt really low compared with the negatives, so I couldn't recommend this one to anyone.”"

A-train is the quintessential "stoner" bud-- it gives the smoker a euphoric head high and then works itself out on the back side by finishing with a relaxed body stoned feeling.

morgan83,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-train/reviews/1396177,"“I was pretty sick when I tried this strain.  I remember it seeming to help with nausea.  I recall it to be very potent for sexual arousal.  I can't give an accurate rating, but I will try this strain again.”"

StickyfingahZ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-train/reviews/1161025,"“Sweet Spicey smell, pretty Stoney.Creeper this one, took awhile for the buzz to kick in, but when it did it was great. Both body and mind were equally stoned. Pain relief was really good, Felt like I could just fall asleep, but instead I went for a walk. Pain relief lasted about 2 hours. The high kinda went for about 3. I only burned a 1/4 gram.  I would buy this again,”"
