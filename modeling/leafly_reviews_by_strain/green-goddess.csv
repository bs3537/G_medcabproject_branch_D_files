Green Goddess
=============
ViewtifulJoel,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1411143,"“Was so excited to give this strain a try. Waited for the perfect morning when both my girlfriend and I were feeling down and ready to just sit on the couch the whole day. Popped some Ggd in my vaporizer and not 10 minutes later we were both up and ready to get things done today with smiles on our faces.
Not really any effect on my body, but I feel focused and colourful.”"
DieselDude420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1416896,"“This is the best Hybrid available - period.

Pro:  Uplifting and moving - jamming to New Minglewood Blues (Grateful Dead)  - but I've danced to music on this stuff all the time.  It's total uplifting stuff, you want to just dance and sing.  
Con: Maybe a little paranoid if you do more than 3 hits.

Taste great actually!  Very smooth, very light (like am I smoking?) and clean and crisp.   Love the color too ---- soft ...”"
DieselDude420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1382078,"“This is by far the #1 weed.  I've bought this for more than two years ... whenever I see it, it's the only weed I'll buy.

There is nothing better than this weed / period, and it's not just the batch.  I've bought it over and over again over the years, true to that - it's the best.

It's best for Sunday morning, drinking coffee, listening to music and surfing.  There is no BETTER weed for any concert you go to.   Buy...”"
DieselDude420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1518089,"“I've smoked and documented more than 50 strains, and this is by far my favorite #1 weed.   There is NO BETTER weed for a concert or listening to music.

There is no better weed than Green Goddess, and I am not saying that because I'm high on it now - I actually am smoking Diamond OG.  But, I regress.

If you see Green Goddess anywhere, you should pick it up, never pass it down.   It is a very unbeat sativa but has sm...”"

triggzy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1410824,"“This is truly green GODdess. I dont even know where to begin with this strain. Smoking this in a room with a warm temp gave me all the relaxation and comfort that I needed. I felt as if the world was lifted off my shoulders.”"
jackNsally05115,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1416897,"“its very euphoric. it makes you geunually happy. talkative and creative.”"
BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1392667,"“This review is for Green God sugar wax by Dabstract.

This gives off a sweet citrus aroma that is very nice.  With a terp profile of 3.5% the taste will please the pickiest of stoners.  As far as effects go this strain will provide relaxation without a great deal of sedation.  Indica dominant but nicely balanced effects.  This strain was able to combat my lower back pain and keep me on my feet working.  All in all, g...”"
SplendidFellow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1203023,"“Out of all strains on the indica side of the spectrum, Green Goddess remains my favorite. It's perfect for gatherings especially, as it allows you to be focused on anything you'd like to while also in a state of intrigued euphoria and happiness. Soooo chill.”"
sgutshall,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1251271,"“Asked my budtender for her favorite strain flavor-wise, and this was her suggestion. And, what a suggestion it was! Heavy, pungent, but still fruity and sour. Really nicely balanced effects as well; this will definitely be one of my go-to stains from now on!”"

I would rate Girl Scout cookies a 10 but I don’t remember how I felt with it. And for that I cannot rate this a number but rather, a feeling. My feelings about this particular strain, are that, I feel euphoric, *que a whole new world-Aladdin , feel like dancing, I feel like it’s a spring day even though it’s winter. I feel drunk.

Goldaline,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1392288,"“This could easily be my new favorite strain. The flower I smoked was homegrown, and I'm not sure if that helps, but it was pretty potent. This one definitely helps with depression and anxiety. It is also one of few strains I've found don't stop me from being productive, especially creatively. When I smoke Green Goddess before I draw, I spend less time second-guessing myself and get more accomplished faster.”"
Theshiznitman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1347961,"“Really good hybrid! Strong citrus aroma makes for a really good flavor! Good for anytime.”"
Cbadrunner94,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1392197,"“One of the strongest strains I have ever tried, got it as a mid shelf and it was still pretty potent.I'm somewhat scared to try it as a top shelf or private reserve.  If you are going to a concert or party this is the strain you need. It's the best of both worlds. Perfectly gives you both a Sativa and Indica high. The only downside to this strain is that when I smoked it in the morning I got a comedown in the afterno...”"

rsjrpn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1374314,"“Wasn't too impressed with the small, subdued looking buds but big things come in small packages. Really unique flavours, Especially the aftertaste that lingers like fine wine. The only accurate word for this one is special. Zero couch lock but instead a creative, bubbly high that's already made me wish I'd bought more. Bummer. Still $5/per at Releaf. Thanks Randy”"
vapinmj,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-goddess/reviews/1288952,"“amazing citrus grapy aroma when you open the bag. buds are dense and very rich in trichomes. very clean tasting.  High is heavy on indica but has some cerebral effects which are great for stress.  not so good as a muscle relaxant tho. 3 hits and ur done tolerance is at 500mg THC/day. its one hit shit otherwise.  buds are very dense. if it was more congolese x critical mass it would be my all day medicine.”"

I have been a serious Skunk lover since the mid 70's when I started to grow the BC Native strain.  It's straight off Limonene terpenes and its over all citrus odour is exactly what I have always craved.”"

It actually made me cough while using the vaporizer, which is a tell-tale sign the bud was packed with heady trichomes.”"

It can be a good day strain since it kills pain and it's not to strong to carry on daily activities. But at the same time it's not a very potent painkiller and if you like to get buzzed it's far from the best. It kills stress. Taste almost nothing except being pungent herbal, slight spices and citrus but all of this very subtle compare to the herbal side. It's a love or hate...”"

The high was very calming but very potent and relaxing, and then uplifting and euphoric. Which is why I feel it was crossed with a high sativa strain on top of the goddess.
