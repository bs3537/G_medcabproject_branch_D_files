Django provides the user with an intense uplifted and euphoric sensation, however due to the strains lower THC content experienced users may need a higher dosage to achieve the desired effects. The taste  hits the pallet with a bold floral flavour followed by sweet, earthy undertones. Smell is identical to taste, very floral yet sweet and earthy. O...”"

Beautiful tight, dense buds w a b...”"
