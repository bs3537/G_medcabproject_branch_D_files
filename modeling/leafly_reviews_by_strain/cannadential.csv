sugartits420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannadential/reviews/1165683,"“I really enjoyed smoking on this cannadential. The bud was so pretty I almost didn't want to break it up! It released a pungent fruity smell when I was breaking it up. There was a fruity aftertaste left on my tongue once I exhaled. The high was very mellow and relaxing. It gave me a calm, worry free feeling and was good to smoke on before bed.”"
JacksonSparrow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannadential/reviews/1139044,"“This is truly a wonderful smoke. It holds many medicinal properties, giving it the perfect marijuana for those who are in chronic pain, but also provides a stellar stone for recreational smokers. This has become one of my classic favorites. It simply puts me in a dreamlike state where I ten to lose time, and most certainly lose loads of pain. I had to take off from work today for I was very nauseated this morning. No...”"

wassafax,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannadential/reviews/1191496,"“What do I think? I think if you have the chance of getting your hands on some of this, you should definitively try it. It has one of the most relaxed highs I've experienced lately and it doesn't bury you into the couch so much you cant make friends. Additionally, I find it good for that extra focus (and enjoyment) while playing board or videogames.”"
jlsscbs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannadential/reviews/1067867,"“Picked this strain up from The Giving Tree in North Phoenix. What a great smoke! Although your buzz doesn't last real long, it comes on and hits you like Kung Fu! Great for daytime use when you need to get stuff done, go on a hike, or solve all the worlds problems in a matter of minutes! Certainly on my top 5 list!”"
RickyTick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannadential/reviews/1067876,"“Supper Fruity, starts out sativa but ends with indica. definitely a bedtime bud. The High was quick to onset and rather intense, but after about 10 minutes the "growing" high subsided. the overall high lasted for about 30 minutes and it would be safe to say that the sativa side contributed to that portion of the high and that the Indica brought up the rear. feel incredibly sleepy, like there was sand in my eyes. grea...”"

JWizard1JamJAr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannadential/reviews/1396119,"“This is easily one of my favorite strains. I went to my caretaker and took a look at his selection and saw the sample of Cannadential sitting in his "mids" section. Upon closer examination, I noticed that the density of the trichomes made it seem like it sure wasn't a "mid" or middle quality flower. Nonetheless, I took my opportunity and paid him mid price for it, took it home and immediately gave it a try. I smoked ...”"

michaelggg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannadential/reviews/1067885,"“My Local Carries This Regularly. It's always on the top shielf, and that's a long reach, but it is a real pleaser, smooth smoking, with a unique summery earthy tones.”"
TheNugLife,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannadential/reviews/1067897,"“Very nice bud for night time use, as it calmed and put me to sleep quickly.
Felt the high kick in pretty quickly after just 1 bowl (high tolerance).
The smell, taste and appearance is slightly above 'average' 
*medical top shelf grade*”"
mtchyg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannadential/reviews/1352684,"“The flavor here is earthy and slightly diesel. The scent keeps the diesel but has a fruitier tone. 

Kind of a creeper. First 5-10 minutes out of my vape didn't hit me that hard. But after that it settled in my body more once I turned up the heat on the pax.”"

The buzz is quite long, and in two seperate phases. The first makes me feel funny, giggly, creative, and energic for the first 30 mins. Then it's slowly changes to a ''indica'' kind of buzz. First you feel like if you got s...”"

This is by far one of the best around with the great staff and pre-rolls galore, if you buy right:) The Cannadential is some of the best flower in town. Check it out and you wont be dissapointed. Thanks Giving Tree of Mesa:)”"
RickyTick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannadential/reviews/1067887,"“Tried it again 8/19/2013. enjoyed the overall flavor but put me in a bit of a coughing fit this time, no biggie.. still the only thing that i don't like about this strain is that it makes me feel more paranoid then I'm okay with.. i will use again because it is rather nice for pain management. A bedtime bud for sure”"
