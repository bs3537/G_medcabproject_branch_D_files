LazyBaked,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/toxic-punch/reviews/1157495,"“Very high grade stuff. The only reason I wouldn't give it an A+ is because it doesn't last very long. The type of buzz you can still function on. Good for during the day but if used at night is very relaxing. Smell and taste is awesome.

Looks: Light green buds with dark green leaves. Lots of orange hairs with medium density.

Smell: Very fruity with a hint of pine/skunk. Hints of blueberry

Buzz type: Soaring head s...”"

BaronOfBud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/toxic-punch/reviews/1201149,"“A sativa- dominant beauty, found it on the exotic shelf at Ultra and I couldn't pass it up. Strong fruity aromas mixed with hints of berry and pine. Definitely a heady and energetic burst of euphoric effects. A good find, I'm glad it exists.”"

HazeRage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/toxic-punch/reviews/1250292,"“This strain was bought from a recreational shop in washington rated at 20% thc... The buds seemed like they weren't flushed well... didnt taste amazing.. slighty sweet but i think a better flush and it would have been very tasty.. Bud structure was rock solid but nothing special.. Looked like mids... Got me stoned though... Overall disappointing would never buy this strain again”"
