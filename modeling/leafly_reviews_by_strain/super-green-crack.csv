If you looked closely they did look very dense with crystals. But otherwise not exactly eye catching. The taste is also not my favorite but that could be my piece right now. 

But the potency.  Outstanding. True a very little bit goes a long long way. Never felt more energetic in my life. Just felt like an energy to just get...”"

I saved a show-nug because it was quite possibly the most beautiful herb I've ever seen.  The buds looked like rocks, but so much more extreme and pronounced than normal GC.  Big, dense, hair-covered oval shaped rocks.  The effect was by far the most stimulating cannabis I have ever smoked.  I picked this up in th...”"

(aka. Super Green Crack) 

Strong flavor, and thick feeling in the throat but surprisingly not harsh at all. High feeling hits fast and very hard, but isn't like a smack in the face. The high builds very quickly but doesn't destroy you. 

Surprisingly extremely alert and as if I can move more freely than normal but I'm so comfy that I don't want to move. Very calm and composed, in control....”"

The nugs are dark green with bright orange hairs, dense and sticky. This starts off as a strong, euphoric head high. The buzz came on quickly, and I felt very energetic. After and hour, I can feel myself beginning to slip into a buzzing, moderate body high.”"
