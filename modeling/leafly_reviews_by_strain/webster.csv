Webster
=============
OGDOG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/webster/reviews/1296784,"“Webster is a mellow buzz, far from the description I read. I felt happy, euphoric but not energized. But that may be my disposition. Nice flavor and smokes well in a vaporizer. Beautiful buds from local dispensary. Recommend this to anyone who has aches, pain or inflammation.”"
ultrapop,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/webster/reviews/1361116,"“Well with only two reviews of note, it seems this is a brand new strain and somebody's getting it right! I have been looking for a nice daytime sativa with a good dose of CBD along side the 19%THC it checked in at. The CBD content of this was 2.19%.

The flower unground has little to no scent profile, but when ground up everything gets released. The cure on this was nice and came out like a wet sand consistency. Now ...”"

Love this strain.  The terpine profile and aroma of this flower is amazing. Tropical, fruity, reminds me of Jack H in feels and effects, but more clear headed. Great day time, and I love mixing it with a heavy indica at nighttime.”"
panYpaz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/webster/reviews/1574568,"“probably one of the best aromas i've ever come across hinting towards a complex terepene profile i wish i knew! when the jars is opened the whole room gets a pineapple/clementine aroma with a hint herbal savoriness. I usually avoid sativas due to my anxiety but this was a calm uplifting cerebral high that didn't make my thoughts race. Overall, well rounded sativa leaning hybrid in my opinion!”"
charliebell95,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/webster/reviews/1350151,"“I felt a bit more of a body high on this strain but overall I liked it. The suppose to be affects aren't what they really are. Instead of feeling energized, I felt more tired and relaxed.”"
willb16,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/webster/reviews/1420888,"“This is my favorite strain of all time. A weekly eighth of Webster got me through 8 months of employment at a certain fast food restaurant know for its arches.”"
tanukimoon,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/webster/reviews/1578645,"“Middle of the road sativa!!  It does leave you feeling energized, but the flavor is muddled. It smelled good enough in the jar, so I grabbed some. I'm ok with it, I just would have rather checked out a different sativa. Not terrible, but not exceptional either.”"
queerlybutch,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/webster/reviews/1347109,"“i love this sativa. i get an unmistakable "pick me up" from this. cleaning my house is suddenly so fun. i don't have any jitters or anxiety from this one either. i love it.”"
