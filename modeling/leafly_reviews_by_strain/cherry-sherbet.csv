dharmapile,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-sherbet/reviews/1717963,"“This is the first strain I have given 5 stars. first of all, it's delicious. nice creamy cherry on the exhale. the next thing you know, you're like really happy. finally the pain melts away, and that happy light feeling lasts quite awhile. I've been able to toke this throughout the day and feel relaxed without being sedated. It's hard for me to find an all day pain relief strain that doesn't give me dumb head!”"

Hawksmokes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-sherbet/reviews/1572081,"“First review ever after being on here for awhile, but I love this strain. As someone who uses cannabis for recreational and occasionally medical, I LOVE this strain, bought a cheaper bho cartridge and I can still taste that tangy cherry, with a little hint of cream at the end to give it a sherbet taste. Completely barraged me with relaxation and a care-free feeling, great if you need an escape for a day. Only reason ...”"

Taste was same through a pipe loaded bowl from green to dust. Very floral tasting”"

Sensei-Sala,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-sherbet/reviews/1720707,"“Strong cherry and other heavy berry aromas as well as exhale aftertaste. A good body relaxer/tingler strain but only gives you a brief moment of intensity then mellows out. In my opinion this is a solid beginner strain for people needing severe/moderate pain relief.”"

Mommagreenthumb97,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-sherbet/reviews/1682105,"“Not a fan at first. I didn’t read any information on it before smoking some. Definitely different types of effects than I’m used to. Made my whole body feel tingly and warm. You can really feel it behind your eyes almost right away.”"
anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-sherbet/reviews/1314689,"“It didn't make me sleepy or relaxed enough.  It has a strong smell when in the Pre-Roll container.”"
ashlielizabeth1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-sherbet/reviews/1410853,"“Disappointed. Got the worst anxiety from this.. it put me in the hospital. I typically don't go for hybrid anything, and stick with heavy indicas, but the bud tender recommended it for me. Unusual case? smoked it again today.. did even realize until I was numb in the face. never again!”"
