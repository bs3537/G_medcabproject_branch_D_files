Fire OG

Jackboothe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fire-og/reviews/1415570,"“Fire OG is NOT to be underestimated. As a super- sativa afficianado I'm usually somewhat reletivley underwhelmed by decent, but dime a dozen "OG's." This however, is a kick in the face and a ripping sativa one at that. Fire OG and its crosses Firewalker (fire x skywalker) and Fire King (x king louis) are all superior, (while I believe the latter to be the strongest) this is fucking intense and uplifting until you sta...”"

The drunkenness disappeared and an enjoyable mental buzz that started to churn into a body high as well.  I started smiling more than usual and would start jiggling at little things.  Once things got physical, I noticed myself being a more attentive, considerate lover.  My Body started moving in a c...”"

As I smoked it, it definitely burns your throat and you'll cough, but good cough in a way. It definitely gives out that good high you get from Fire. Excellent strain, flavor isn't my favorite in this strain. But worth buying, not recommended to people who are new to smoking. Excellent for stress and pain.

Crodz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fire-og/reviews/1350728,"“Without a doubt one of the most amazing strains I have ever smoked. What set this apart for me was the delayed high that I got that hit like an absolute truck. It was insanely cerebral for me and had me in the zone for playing video games. Never have I experienced a video game so vividly. What made it even better was the fact that the high lasted for almost 3 hours and then put me to bed perfectly.”"

I feel euphoric and happy every night and then the indica body high kicks in and I get a great night's sleep. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has depression, stress or anxiety. Just make sure to be careful if you're smoking it because it is quite strong.”"
