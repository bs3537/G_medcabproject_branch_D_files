I just wanted to take a slight edge off so I packed a third of a bowl and hit it well and yup -- baked. Master Chef (High Files) ability with this high: I just made the best PB&J sandwich of my life; super chunky peanut butter, peach amaretto butter, and peach apricot spread on French bread.”"
buzzpunk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-diesel/reviews/1367922,"“White Diesel is an interesting strain. It has a definite sativa high to it, but has just enough of an indica feel to it to allow for you to relax completely to some music or a film. I've found the high only lasts around an hour and a half, but it doesn't leave you feeling burned out afterwards like a more indica heavy strain would. This strain isn't going to get you to a 10/10 high easily, but it's great for unwindin...”"

The previous reviews led me to believe this was a clear headed "daytime work" strain, and boy they are right, thanks guys! I believe this was $12 a G pre-tax $60 for 4G. For the price and the head which is totally "daytime" it's freakin great! Actually gives me a pep and makes me want to do stuff!. As f...”"

SunKissedKween,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-diesel/reviews/1298070,"“I like the smell but find myself smoking more often because the high doesn't last very long. While it last (it really doesn't) its cool.”"
GettinHighSince95,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-diesel/reviews/1221818,"“Wow! This high brings me back to my high school days. Really energetically calm and euphoric.  Extremely long lasting. 2 to 3 hours of smiles. The pain of a long  hard day eased away! Smells pungent diesel and kinda buttery pine. Taste like fuel and butter with good earthy exhale. Im going back to get more tomorrow!!!”"

schneikatze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-diesel/reviews/1238420,"“This is a great strain. I highly recommend it, I've smoked for 12 almost 13 years, and this is one of my tops. It has a strong smell, but not overbearing, you smell the diesel but get a hint of lemon as well. It has a sweet, earthy taste that's light. beautiful buds. Takes effect fairly quickly, mellow, and relaxing but with energy still to get things done. Decreases stress and opens up creativity and keeps you focus...”"
febaker1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-diesel/reviews/1367923,"“I'm a HUGE sativa fan. Indica's are my go to for bedtime. I'd love to give this a full 5 stars but it's hard. I feel like it has enough indica to kind of make me lazy, not sleepy, but lazy. It makes it hard to smoke this during the day when I have to always be on the move. It's not bad though. I love the smell and taste.”"
Danyatton,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-diesel/reviews/1357998,"“Fantastico. The initial heavy diesel taste of this indica dominant strain is quickly overcome with floral tones of dried flowers and asian spices. A lovely high of mainly couch lock but still enough motivation to venture into the outside world.”"

Clement,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-diesel/reviews/1150138,"“The smell of this strain is what hits at first, since it is awfully pungeant and pervasive. The buds were not that dense but dried out rock-solid. Thricomes forms during tha last two weeks a frosty ice-cap (hence the name "white" diesel, I suppose). The taste is strong, spicy, and acid. The buzz hits real fast : you don't even have to wait for the third toke to known for sure that now, yes, you're in for good. Yet it...”"
