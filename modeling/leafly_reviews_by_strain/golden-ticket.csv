Patfins,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-ticket/reviews/1717196,"“It's a nice strain, a good stay-at-home kind of high, I feel really relaxed and comfortable, as well as happy. As for negatives, I sort of get a bit of a headache but nothing bad really and that may just be my paranoia talking too. It doesn't make you too couch locked either, I still feel like I can get up and walk around while still feeling very relaxed. Defiantly a good strain, and one worth trying; highly recommen...”"

I love it before work to get me pumped and keep a steady grind 🤙🏻 I’d say sativa dominant.”"

Cutting a star for it, as i want to lose weight.

Embraced my curious self quite well, read some good comics, watched birdman and an episode of black mirror.”"
MedicalIncredible,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-ticket/reviews/1342640,"“Not to be Debby Downer but I'll average sampling 100 strains in 365 days time and by far the 2nd worst strain I tried was "Golden Ticket" 
Only L.A. Confidential was worse. 
Maybe the grow/cure was bad, maybe those strains are better in California 
Idk 
I have no clue what everyone is raving about 

Let's put it this way
I'll turn it down if offered

SO many superior strains out there 
Don't waste your money”"

Great mellow head high, with a sligh body. Tasty!”"
