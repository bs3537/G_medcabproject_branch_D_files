FatcloudFuckBoi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dizzy-og/reviews/1412319,"“The most flame bud I have ever gotten a hold of, definitely recommend. Easy to hide if your high too, doesn't give red eyes and if you try hard you can be serious while being bombed as fuck.”"

Smells Dank
Tastes Great
Looks amazing
The high sticks around for a long time



P.S. Don't trash a strain in the review if you got it from somewhere that is trash or if the batch was trash.”"

HappyGrinch420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dizzy-og/reviews/1535626,"“This strain looks pretty BUT lacks flavor. Don't expect much OG flavor from her dried flowers.”"
Kiarahcoleman14,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dizzy-og/reviews/1594988,"“It took me forever to find this strain, but I finally found it in Santa Ana, CA. It took me 2 years to get it and I am not disappointed at all! It was well worth the wait. It has a very strong flavor. When you hit it you can feel it in your chest the first few hits. It kind of reminds me of Khalifa Kush but it’s better in my opinion. It smokes great very cloudy smoke. I am completely satisfied. This strain is hard to...”"
racs037,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dizzy-og/reviews/1531770,"“I felt amazing while smoking it. Then the next day I was sick, nausea, chills, diarrhea, literally dizzy from smoking the Dizzy OG. It’s probably my personal experience and doesn’t apply to everyone. Just fair warning for those that don’t smoke on the regular. I couldn’t handle it and I smoke once a month maybe twice.”"
