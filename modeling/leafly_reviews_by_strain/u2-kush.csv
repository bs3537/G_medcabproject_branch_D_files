A little different from my usual tastes of indicas that are dense and lightly sweet-tasting, but I enjoy this flavor immensely because of it's delicious kushy taste and very strong effect. ...”"
themermaid805,https://www.leafly.com/indica/u2-kush/reviews/1280306,"“It’s a beautiful day to try this sunny floral strain with its super unique flavor combination of sweet, earthy and mineral. On the nose this is reminiscent of a day at the beach in Southern California- tar, a hint of citrus, and a warm rush of floral/lavender notes- the heart is in bloom with the taste! This indica dominant hybrid will leave you feeling like you’re running to stand still, starting off super amped onl...”"

Its hard for me to fully explain it because I'm really baked now. If someone reads this and has smoked a U2 blunt before, please confirm its true. I hate typing when I'm high. Late.”"

Nope. Felt relaxed but mind was far too active. Buy a small Gram first, test it out for yourself first.”"

It hit me really quick with a relaxed, body buzz, and an insane need for sleep. I suggest taking this one RIGHT before bed. It comes fast. I did feel like it went away pretty quick though, but I did need to stay up a bit longer. Sleeping with this and smoking a bit more than 2-4 hits and that would make for some really great sleep. Didn't remove my pain...”"
