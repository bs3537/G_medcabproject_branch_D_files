CannaCelt,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chems-sister/reviews/1389826,"“This was vaped as an oil and was my first experience with cannabis. Popped my cherry hard but in a really good way.  Gave me a strong head high, incredible insight, and euphoric times.

I am a picky bitch when it comes to flavour, but though this was strong, it was not too bad.

Knocked my chronic pain out for 72 hours after first use.”"
DonkeyMeat,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chems-sister/reviews/1335826,"“Very good sativa very good, I work grave yards and this strain is good because when its 3:30 am you need some living up to do. I zone out for a couple hours and I'm finished with the night, well after I clean out the fringe.”"

Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chems-sister/reviews/1394395,"“The Package: Very nice all black with a beautiful girl on the cover of it, tested and made sure it's safe for use THCA 25.87mg is going to be a heavy one for sure.
The Smell: Tearing off the plastic to envelop my senses in a lushful pine and lemon forest, some of the small hints of a smoky eucalyptus chemical aroma is there, but faint.
The Look: Looks like a more frosty og kush, as if it grew older not quite as green...”"

BostonBaked79,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chems-sister/reviews/1374879,"“This strain was OK...nothing like ChemDawg at all....it did the trick, but I guess depending on where you get this strain and who's growing it, it might vary.”"
Xboxlord989,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chems-sister/reviews/1541514,"“I'm a seasoned dabber......And this is the ONLY strain where I have anxiety off of lol.  I love it. Super extremely potent. makes me Wanna create and play guitar. I love that overpowering chemical taste.”"
neurotictoker,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chems-sister/reviews/1540515,"“man oh man, what an interesting strain. chose this one over Agent Orange and Pure Kush cause I never really come by pure sativas. 

the high sneaks up on you gradually, once it hits it rolls on pretty strong. I’m a very well seasoned toker, I have a pretty high tolerance but with one bong rip I feel this stoney feeling envelop my eyes and face. 

makes you wanna get up and do things! I’ve been neglecting to move this...”"
GetRICHYGYE,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chems-sister/reviews/1325008,"“Very high thc levels 27.90 to be exact, flavorful , small but with a powerful powerful kick.  Very sweet kush flavor  almost like gas. A very euphoric stain  in every angle. This is what a sativa should feel like. Truly a favorate in my book”"

Wonderfulthings,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chems-sister/reviews/1759785,"“I have contacted Leafly to remove my original review.  All I can say is I smoked some more yesterday afternoon before heading out to do a bunch of mundane errands.  Wow.  I was fully alert but in my own incredibly luscious bubble.  I was so impressed.  After four hours of running around I arrived home and still felt incredible.  This is how I remember it before.  What a great deal as I got it for a black Friday deal ...”"

Sharkleesha,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chems-sister/reviews/1656269,"“It was alright, it gets the job done. Super strong head high. After around 5 hits and 5 minutes it hit me like a train wreck. Made me really anxious and paranoid, high lasted 3 hours”"
winterland6977,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chems-sister/reviews/1374878,"“Picked some Chem Sis up from Harborside.  Absolutely covered in trichomes- gorgeous.  And typical of the Chemdawg family, the high was wonderful.”"
