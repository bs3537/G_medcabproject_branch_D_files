Green Monster
=============
Zombaked,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-monster/reviews/1410297,"“Great hard hitting high. I feel it in the center of my head then is slowly creeps down to my neck and back. It's a relaxing but creative high. I feel I want to learn and analyze things more and I become very talkative. Great strain that it's high lasts.”"
tylerjdean,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-monster/reviews/1410296,"“This shits fire. Real relaxing! clear head high with strong body high. Good night time use or lazy day.”"
Sapphyy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-monster/reviews/1410298,"“Picked up a Half Ounce of this at USC Tacoma (Whose prices are AWESOME) for $75. All in all I say it's some pretty dank bud. Nugs aren't as big as I would want them to be but it smells good, tastes good, and gives me a nice head high. I would say that $75 for 14 grams was more than a steal for top shelf meds like this. I'm not sure if I got a good batch or if it's all fire. A strain I would definitely recommend!”"
lemonkushbowls420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-monster/reviews/1385212,"“Hit me very fast, very uplifting, euphoric high. Great for morning/day time use. Buds were really light green with some orange hairs here and there, smelled skunky and kinda piney. Tastes just like the dell”"

CoYoung2197,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-monster/reviews/1377284,"“Strains genetics: OG Kush, Purple Urkle, and Killer Queen. This is a very potent strain delivering a very clean head high followed by a chilling body high. Perfect for those with ADHD!”"
mycalw,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-monster/reviews/1163400,"“This is as close to vyvance I've come to in my couple of months since being in CA. It's really helping with focus and energy. It's heavy head with nice body. No fogginess. Like green crack, this is gives you a RedBull feeling but with out the mischievious prankster edge.”"
Skunkbunker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-monster/reviews/1068331,"“Decent high, shitty after effects. Not the type of bud you want to be smoking alot of.”"

RollinDoja509,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-monster/reviews/1379584,"“I have had an ounce of Green Monster.

The buds were not the prettiest, not as in the trim or the way they were grown - I mean the pot was just straight kinda ugly.

The name is fitting, it was monstrous Yo. They were bright green buds coated with super sour crystals, the sour taste was definitely there during and after consumption.

High was also very intriguing, classic stone with a major munchie possibility.

Only negative is that it's got a disgusting smell and it doesn't look pretty

But it does the job. Nice weed”"
Aveenosecret,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-monster/reviews/1702656,"“This strain is pretty damn great, you feel it instantly in your head and it makes you want to dance, it’s really sick if you’re wanting to use it in the daytime and I imagine it’s great for wake n bake, the only downside is that it makes me such an insomniac, it keeps me up till 3/4 in the morning which really isn’t good but what can ya do!”"

VeniceDreamway,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-monster/reviews/1458988,"“Smoked over the last two days, but pretty sure I have a good understanding of the strain. Makes me feel sort of drunk. I am sociable and talkative with a good mood, and feel just a hint of anxiety. Also, it definitely doesn't increase my IQ, but I speak your mind more, which is why I compare it to alcohol. Gives a uplifting body high too. 

I would smoke this in low amounts socially with friends, not at home by mysel...”"

Low13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-monster/reviews/1580517,"“Picked up a quarter of this stuff. Smoked a bowl and instantly felt it off the first exhale. Unique taste with a bit of a strong aftertaste of earthy citrus. Good body heavy  feeling but not crippling. 

Would I get it again? Yes.”"

I picked up an 1/8 of this from my local dispensary, it was a bit pricy at $65 an 1/8. This is a pure Sativa. The nugs are dry my full of crystals and it really has no smell at all. It hits right away and is a complete head high. I did not find it very potent at first. That was one rip out of my glass pipe. The next time I took three hits and was feeling i...”"
