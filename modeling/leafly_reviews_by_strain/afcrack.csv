This included a great feeling of happiness, but a negative would be how anxious it made me. When trying it with friends we all got the same pressure around our ears and sides of the neck, similar to headband in that aspect, and seemed to lose our sense of time. What impressed me most about this...”"

Time stops for the person that medicate with this, very interesting strain, I recommend people medicate in a group and will have that circle laugh that we all love :)”"

But other than that it really was enjoyable”"
