I usually stay at my peak for a half hour, but this had me feeling really STONED for about two hours. The relaxing effect is amazing, and any pain will be taken away almost immediately. Prepare to watch a lot of TV and do nothing else.”"

Light green apple nugs wrapped in pale orange halos, these crystal-coated pillows are citrus goodness.  The clementine aroma that jumps out of the jar follows through the tasty expansive smoke.  Not for work, this one cranks you up for a bit but can induce some serious couch lock.”"
