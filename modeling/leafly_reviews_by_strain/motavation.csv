TGKrazy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/motavation/reviews/1335984,"“This strain is very strange to me, I had a very heavy Indica sensation but I didn't get that couch locked feeling. Very good for pain relief before activitys. Thank you high mountain health.”"
Jimmyl24,https://www.leafly.com/indica/motavation/reviews/1335985,"“Love the fruity tastes! Mix of berries and citrus maybe? Either way the relaxing and calming effects are very enjoyable and it is very effective for night time medication.”"
InMotion,https://www.leafly.com/indica/motavation/reviews/1209043,"“This was one of the first strains that I tried post recreational legalization. It was billed as a sativa, but the effects were much more mellow. Of course. It's an Indica! Had I expected an Indica I would certainly have been looking for different qualities.
Bottom line: It's pleasant, but not impressive.”"
