CommieMomma,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mandala-1/reviews/1277441,"“Not as knocked out by this one as I have with others I've tried. Nice smooth smoke but really bad dry mouth, like Sahara-bad, and I get brutally red eyes with this one. It also gets me too high, just verging on the paranoia, but it makes me too immobile to deal with the mounting anxiety. It has good pain relieving aspects but the negatives just are a bit too much.
