wadewestwhy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1313254,"‚ÄúDammmmmn. This is strong. Definite couch-lock. I can't get up right now. I'm basically dead. I'm now a ghost. Ouija board me later for ghost stories.

In terms of anxiety, it's sort of making me a bit anxious, but overall I feel pretty good. I would def recommend this for anyone who has a high tolerance. It's hands down a night time strain.

Lured in by its sticky sweet aroma I partake. Instantly reminded of the tweeked blueberry burst Blue God brings (must be the God bud side of the family). Different from the simple. Far from normal, a wave of honey bear blueberry pinenut saturates my pallet.

ActualFactual,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1359136,"‚Äú4.5 Stars.  Strong.  Definitely relaxing, great pre-sleep bedtime strain that should be enjoyed for an hour or so before hitting the sack.  Vaped.  Slept amazingly well and had zero grogginess in the morning - or any negative after effects whatsoever for that matter.  Delicious taste and thick lung filling draws.  VERY nice relaxing strain.  Does what it's supposed to as an Indica!‚Äù"
TopSarge,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1290668,"‚ÄúA good friend of mine procured a bit of this bud for my wife and I and I have to say...he was spot on recommending this strain..  For starters, it is really great looking.  Quite frosty, with quite a few orange hairs running throughout the extremely fat bud structure.  The aroma is a bit on the sweet side with just a little touch of citrus.

Tonight, to my disappointment, I figured out why the first time was so bad... I didn't smoke enough. To really feel the effects of Blue God (and when you do, they are awesome) I had to smoke a good amount more than other strains. For me, Blue God wasn't worth the price I was charged.

The effects, however, may make you think differently. I felt incredibly rel...‚Äù"

ThomasHC,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1182202,"‚ÄúSuper good. One of my top 5. Can't go wrong with it.‚Äù"
khor48,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1193214,"‚ÄúRobust smell, classic indica on the nose.  Took a little bit for the high to develop but when it did I found the effects extremely relaxing.  I vaporized in the bath, and could barely get myself out.  Felt like my body was made of lead and I couldn't move, some would say "couch-locked"  Very clear headed, a good body stone that stays below the shoulders.  Top self strain for evening/nighttime and muscle relaxation.‚Äù"
nvengance,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1290673,"‚Äúthis is an awesome strain for pain management and dealing with the inability to sleep. with that said, I use sleep monitoring devices and although I was definitely out cold, my sleep quality decreased and I have a  carryover high till the next day. I would suggest this be used when sick and needing rest, or after a hard day at the gym, or for any type of pain management.‚Äù"

ghosttropics,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1269287,"‚Äúwow. one of the best indicas i have ever tried, possibly de-throning bubba kush as my new all time favourite sleep strain. not only will it knock you out, but it will knock you out with a smile on your face, and in a great mood. extremely thick vapour, harsh, but thats a very small price to pay for such potency. relaxes your body AND mind enough to pass out right away, but unlike many other late night sleep strains (...‚Äù"
