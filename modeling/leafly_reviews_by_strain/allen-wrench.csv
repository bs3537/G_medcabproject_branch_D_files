StukaFox,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/allen-wrench/reviews/1417317,"“And then there's Allen Wrench. When it comes to the Wrench, don't flail around with grams: go right for an eighter. You'll appreciate the bag of High Times centerfold buds -- compact, rippled with red hairs and powdered with a dusting of white crystals; this is some of da kind that demands your attention. Don't just snap off a bud and cram it in your pipe, you fucking Philistine! No, stop and admire. Breathe in the c...”"

The first time I smoked Allen Wrench, it was a fat joint that put me into a strange, trippy, dissociative state. It was exceedingly bizarre, and probably won't even sound plausible if I wrote about it here. Anyways, I took a shower, crashed, and was fine the next day. I'll chalk that up to being an inexperienced smoker with a super dank strain. 

The next time I smoked it, I was sure to smo...”"

petergreen80,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/allen-wrench/reviews/1417375,"“It's like smoking a massively trippy strain while drinking a giant red bull.  So much energy and quick intelligent internal dialogue.  Yet there is a relaxing mental buzz that makes you feel good even through the jitteryness.  This was much stronger than I expected and a lot of fun.  I would not recommend it for sleep at all.  This is for staying up late watching science documentaries and contemplating the universe. ...”"

JCool,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/allen-wrench/reviews/1417377,"“Initially, I would have given this strain a lower rating if it were not for the complex taste, aroma, and sneaky psycho affects that almost wrap your cerebral in a warm, comforting blanket. The flower itself was unappealing (which could be attributed to the flushing and curing) yet effective in its yield and the accumulation of keif. I was impressively surprised how relaxing it was though there were no indica-dominan...”"

Ok, now that we have that out of the way, let me start by saying that I am currently on Allenwrench. I love this shit. This is my go to, every day strain. Allenwrench is about as much sativa I can handle and I do have to be sitting for the first few minutes because it really gets my mind going.

I tend to go as sativa as possible, digging Durban, hazes, like that to replace my Rx ADD medication. These strains work well both to help with concentration and sleep, for me. For reference, Ghost Train Haze is my gold standard strain, when I can get it. The Allen Wrench is very well balanced; not super...”"

I mean imagine your favorite high, but at the same you’re just pre-occupied by so many things but this time you actually finish everything. Gives you purpose.

Seriously some of these reviews need to be removed  they are just stupid.  On another note this strain is an awesome pungent sour smoke with earthy hints, active engaged high.  If cultivating I suggest watching your nutrients as it burns very easily, it also stretches alot so be ready to top, train, and or scrog.”"

dohpee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/allen-wrench/reviews/1059940,"“Great cerebral high not long after smoking, great general uplifting pleasant blaze. I have high tolerance, maybe a bit much for an unseasoned sativa smoker. Soft and smooth in bong or pipe, seems wasteful to smoke a j because only a couple hits is enough to get me a ticket to the happy place.”"

Body high among the best I've felt from a sativa. I will make this one of my daytime meds on an ongoing basis. This fantastic flower was obtained at Zen Living Cooperative.”"

Spokev,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/allen-wrench/reviews/1303250,"“musicslug used the word "jittery" and I can't think of a better word. After a hit or two, I wished I'd started earlier as I wasn't sure if I'd be able to pick up my son from grandma's house! But, after about 45 min to an hour I was able to function ok. So, give it about that much time to peak and you should be ok to get some stuff done! Good for cleaning the house or organizing the home office.”"

Lately, I've been trying to branch out and explore sativas with a more energizing buzz.  So I was a little surprised to find myself so very relaxed, and nodding off, after two bowls of Allen Wrench!  A good high overall, but I had been expecting to leap off the couch in a flurry of activity.  I thought it was just me, but my sativa-loving...”"

Has a great smell leaning twords a afghani diesel mix, could have just been my phenotype though. Effects are extremely euphoric, with a surprising amount of couch lock. The buds are quite dense and sticky when grown correctly, and are visually marked by long brown pistols. Great bud”"

honey1207,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/allen-wrench/reviews/1281532,"“I really enjoyed this, made the mistake at smoking some before bed which isn't a great idea. I was way too alert so definitely one to think about trying out before then. I don't care much for the taste at all, it seems to linger for quite some time. But overall I enjoyed it and will be keeping it around especially for days when my depression makes me feel unmotivated.”"

The nugs on this one were small and dense, and completely covered in crystals. The smell is earthy and pungent, but the taste is all chemical and tar - definitely not my favorite tasting strain, thus the 4 stars.

The high comes on slowly, with some light body relaxation, but creeps up on you and hits hard...”"
