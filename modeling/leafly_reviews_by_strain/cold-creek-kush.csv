Very creative with ideas zapping in all directions. I'm in a low emotional state because I'm fighting heartbreak and this calmed me down. As a result, I'm a little more happy. When my tolerance was lower and I tried this for the first time, it did make me a tad drowsy. Now, it doesn't make me sleepy at all.
