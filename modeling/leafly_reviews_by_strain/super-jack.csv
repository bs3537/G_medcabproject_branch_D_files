Super Jack

Over that time you get to know the personality of a strain really well.  Here's my moment of clarity about Super Jack:  it is the ultimate "chore" weed.  It makes you want to do productive things.  In fact, it makes you want to do things that you normally wouldn't even want to do, that maybe you've been putting off.  Menial tasks ...”"

This strain starts off with a minor head buzz and light-body high, when at its peak it has medium body effects with subtle couch lock, also medium cerebral effects causing one to think rather than space.

From its incredibly unique scent and its spicy, ammonia flavor to its smoke, it's a HIGH grade strain. I felt incredibly talkative and euphoric, so it's perfect for social situations, but its peak tapers off after about 35 minutes, so I recommend vaping to stretch your dollar as this can be on the high end.”"
