Good sense boost with minimal THC flash-chatter or confusion, though it's a very high THC strain. The taste is earthy, citrusy and spicy. The bud is very fluffy and compressible.

I love the reddish hairs on the buds. Super nice high. Everything is chill. Your eyes get droopy and red, but there is no sleepiness effect. It's a full body high with no couch lock.

Grown indoors, non-organic

Bud was very dense but not hard or dry. Dark green sugar leaves densely populated with mostly white and some amber trichomes. Earthy, somewhat subdued aroma with notes of black tea and apricot. Flavor was pleasantly spicy and balanced. Moderate smoke expansion with woody, spicy aftertaste. Onset of high occurred around 3-5 minutes after first inhale ...”"
rachels95,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-congolese/reviews/1334405,"“This strain is killer for morning smokes. I think it is more so if you're looking for a medical effect, like anxiety relief, nausea relief, etc. I find it really helpful for my anxiety in the mornings more than any other strain. It's really heady. Also, it makes you wanna munch out like crazy after. This strain is a must have for people fighting anxiety/ADHD in my opinion. :)”"

It is so much of an Indica that you'll likely fall asleep while smoking it, or shortly thereafter.  I personally need to get things done during the day, so if you are at all interested in being awake, or high, this is not the strain to buy.  For the potency of it, I almost am not getting high from it, so it should be a cheapie, shake type product.  So regret buying a quantity of it!”"
