I at the time was looking for some blue dream at my local dispensary, when I found out the closed early I of course was disappointed.. however not for long. Long story short I was able to get this strain at another dispensary and I gotta say, this strain is by far the best I’ve smoked in awhile... I’m a daily smoker. I’m currently on the couch ...”"

Smell: 5/5. Straight up mandarin oranges with a hint of oak and skunk.
Taste 5/5. Juicy oranges.
Effects 5/5. Big euphoria, moderate relaxation, creativity altered, appetite up, talkative.
Recommended for simply a good time.

I’ll get again.”"

A giggly, energetic high that doesn't knock me on my ass, and will still allow me to be productive, however, potent enough that when I feel like getting stoned, I am never underwhelmed.

This makes for a very grounded and very "aware" strain. Good for beginners, and nice for just genuine sunny days without a thought in the world. Crossfading it has resulted in one becoming overly romantic and loving.”"
