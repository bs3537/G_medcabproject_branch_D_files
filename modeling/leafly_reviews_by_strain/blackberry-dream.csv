Wolfmanjimbo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-dream/reviews/1380933,"“Lovely strain smelled and tasted more like grapefruit then blackberry but has an excellent high small amounts kept me alert and calm for daily activities while large amounts left me giggling on a porch swing looking at the sunset I'd recommend to anyone

Little bit of paranoia my first time smoking it (always happens with my favorites) but after that it was smooth sailing such a great strain”"

Chuck6.6,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-dream/reviews/1385960,"“This was a great suggestion from the Compassionate Cannabis Club. Instant energy and uplifting feeling. 

Smoke was mild (no hacking) with a mild sweet nut flavor.  

Back pain was reduced or at least I was not thinking about it which is a relief.”"

This is smooth and tasty and brings an incredible, heady high. Don't let the smoothness and sweet smell fool you. One or two hits are all I needed to do the trick. THC level at about 28%, makes this a long-lasting buzz. I was very productive and BBD made my gardening chores extra special. This made me aware and spacy, at the same time. I am surprised there ...”"
