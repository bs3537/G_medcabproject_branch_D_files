jaws,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/headbanger/reviews/1381631,"“Complex flavor with dark smokey, "camp fire" qualities.  It was called a "creaper" where I'm from as the high crept upon you. I now assume this has high levels of CBD. A would sure as hell recommend it as I am completely fizzle ducked while writing this Review.”"

I use marijuana for naseau and to stimulate my appetite, as I have a chronic digestive disorder, I need to eat 5k plus calories a day.  There are a lot of strains that help me very much, however this one is among the best for me.  And then, to my utter delight I achieved...”"
ranomaly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/headbanger/reviews/1353490,"“I've been smoking Headbanger for about a week now and it's a really good strain. Great taste and the high last about 2-3 hours.”"
4TwentyBlazeItFgt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/headbanger/reviews/1374695,"“Very sweet aroma and taste, smells like mango prior being combusted and emits a citrusy smell and flavour once burned. These dense buds are coated in sugary trichomes, which produce deep cerebral effects which quickly eliminate stress, anxiety and depression. Though it is a sativa dominant hybrid, it is still able to produce pain relief and body relaxation, albeit not at the same efficiency at which it aids in cerebr...”"
DonQuichot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/headbanger/reviews/1532149,"“Great strain. Amazing taste, very soft, sweet and fruity. Stimulating head high and and the feeling that you want to do something useful with your time, like writing this review. Also nice for playing or listening to music. Recommended to combat depression or anxiety, and does not leave you with a very dry mouth.”"

Headbanger definitely lives up to the name. It calms me down after a long day and somehow during the day i feel calmer. It gave me the munchies but till loving it. Especially being an introvert this helped with carrying conversations and sometimes even starting one. Over all a good nice smokey berry flav...”"

Ryoung710,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/headbanger/reviews/1246378,"“One of my favorite day-time strains. Very gassy smell that follows over into the finish of the smoke on the exhale.
Effects are very uplifting and creative. I love to have this after lunch to kick the afternoon in its ass!
Phenotypes with mostly Diesel scents tend to be more Sativa dominant, while a citrus smell may indicate a true hybrid.”"
Deitab,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/headbanger/reviews/1392461,"“Headbanger isn't what I thought it was.  I was told this is an Indica dominant Hybrid strain, and come here and read the Leafly review and they say it is a sativa dominant strain.  Hmmm... got an 1/8th because it looked good, and it is a nice quality bud for sure, but not really what I was thinking.  I still give it a 4 out of 5.”"

These days everything seems to be a hybrid and it's hard to get those pure expressions of sativa energy or indica relaxation, you kind of end up in a purgatory with some hybrids where you're too monged to do something but you don't feel completely relaxed either.
