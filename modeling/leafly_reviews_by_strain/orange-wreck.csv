I've found that this strain works well when mixed with a chill OG strain, such as SFV OG, Larry OG or Ill OG. As a stand alone, Orange Wreck is great MEDICINE for reducing anxiety, fighting fatigue and depression, and providing cerebral stimulation that increases c...”"

Well Orange Wreck is an easy 4 star rating, if you've been flirting with the idea of trying Sativa's start out with this one. It doesn't give you heavy euphoria & doesn't trigger anxiety.

i rolled myself and 2 other friend an rather big joint each, none of us where high. We tried with my bubbler and nothing more. The only thing we got was a headache.

I once again rolled myself a few joints , i got a bit hight but nothing much.

I would not recommend this to anyone.”"

Taste is a strong sour orange peel. Produced solid vapor in the vaporizer. I would definitely get this bud again. Solid pain reliever, doesn’t do much for appetite.”"

Also smell of this strand has a fruity smell that’s already make u wanna smoke it. The smell gets stronger once u squeeze the bud. When u hit it you can really taste the citrus and earthy flavor the most. It smokes smoothly and give u really great high.”"

It didn't get you high, but it did calm down my anxiety/depression a bit. It also doesn't last as long as other strains I feel. However, the taste was great amd for the short time after I smoked it was night to not think about anything and just be in the moment.”"
