BudBoyCa420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1374661,"“FROSTY FROSTY AND MORE FROST!!! Beautiful looking strain with a very smooth smoke that has a high that creeps up on you.. Strong Thc count that will def give veteran smokers a kick they will look forward to coming back too!! If you are a top shelf smoker make sure you got your mason jar with its White Romulan label on it or you will be missing out on some fire Bud!!”"
Squidgirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1375810,"“Beware - novice and ignorant

I was recommended this at the dispensary due to migraines and it was strain #3 in my new 'medicated' life.  I didn't get the 'head wrap' that I was explained would happen and while it did help the pain a bit - wasn't outstanding.  Some of my head pain lately is starting at the shoulders and that ache never got better.  

White Romulan did seem strong so I kept it light and the strain giv...”"

slbutterfly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1375660,"“White Romulan is a creeper that provides a great body numbing pain relief, though not too heavy, completed by a pleasant calm motivation. Very pretty frosty white flowers, with a sweet piney aroma.. Good anytime medication.”"
mrskelton420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1387644,"“Yup, definitely got the  giggles!! And it was awesome
If you're feeling depressed and down, this will definitely help turn that frown upside down!! My new favorite!!”"
FoundRelief,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1375659,"“My favorite  Strain  so far . 
Clear , motivating but relaxed  ,symptom masking ,magical looking , best I've felt in a long time .”"
s2kier,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1473897,"“The White Romulan Strain always reminds me of Christmas since it's so freaking frosty!!!  When grown well, this potent strain will be dense and frosty while smelling like body odor. When using a vaporizer 380-405 works well. You can go higher if you choose. 
Some of the nugs almost have a purple hue in some areas which is very beautiful. I love Christmas.”"
sb406,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1325838,"“All my jiu jitsu friends love this strain and it's one of my favorites too.
It puts you in a great mood to work out with lots of energy and positivity.

We grew this at Bloom a few years ago, but I can't remember where I recently picked this up. It was either Green House or White Mtn, sorry!”"
willfoster2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1317651,"“The bag appeal is amazing on this strain. It should look like a gleaming white blanket is covering the bud. The taste is very clean and has notes of berry on the exhale. If you smoke enough of it you should feel its indica genetics quite heavily.”"
lightweightloser,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1359453,"“Tastes good, feels good. Definitely relaxing and my go to after I'm done with work.”"
rompers,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1367845,"“Rolled this up right now and it's pretty good. I feel like getting stuff done I literally just cleaned my room. Great hybrid. Might have to update my thing later but 11/10”"

Shitty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1548784,"“excellent flavor smells really fruity in a jar, with the deep pungent smell too really stoney i recommend  this for relaxing.”"
Kourim,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1278599,"“The first time I smoked it , I smoked too large of a quantity to be able to do a review. I will say I was quite stoned for about 5 hours.
On my second  smoked, I smoked a more reasonable amount, like 5 or 6 hits instead of 25-30. 
The high comes on pretty fast and strong. I found it uplifting and I was motivated for activities like car washing and hedge trimming. :-D
This has a bit more of a body buzz to it than  mos...”"

JustinKCHC,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1331023,"“It's a beauty but just overrated as a hybrid. Didn't surprise me by its looks but great strain overall.”"
SappyNHappy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1267239,"“A good hard hitting but super functional hybrid for me. Love the instant head sesation followed by a nice stoney relaxation. I love white rom especially in concentrate form, when i dont want a heavy straight Indicia.”"
mashuckas,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1153464,"“Really nice and mellow.”"
WCisco,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1796462,"“While I did use this strain in the nighttime, I could definitely see it being good during the day. The high was very pleasant and gave me a kind of spacey, stoney, euphoric feeling that had me instantly in a better mood. It also kept me awake without ever making me really feel energetic or racy, like a typical sativa would. And while I'm sure this strain could be used for insomnia, I would recommend it more for fatig...”"
oneandone,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1623238,"“This strain has some great genetics. The White is definitely one of my favorite strains and Romulan is an excellent indica. Large buds loaded with tricombs. Nice smooth smoke, earthy but also with a hint of berry. The high is outstanding. Perfect for relaxing and pain. Also helped with insomnia.”"
jussiejones,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1195353,"“Was looking for a heavy hitting flower and this wasn't it. Only noticed the effects on the first dosage of the day, after that it was hatd to tell. Maybe if I was a fan of sativas I would like it more.”"

dani916,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1196693,"“One of my favorites. Everything just seems so incredibly interesting. Storylines in average TV shows suddenly have so much depth and hidden meaning. And every joke, no matter how lame, is rendering you into a pile of stifled giggles. Life feels FUN. Would highly recommend.”"
ThePotPoet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1239338,"“Really strong strain. I like it, you get really high, but still maintain a high degree of mental clarity.”"
vinylvixen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1253395,"“Smoked via pen, this strain has a great flavor with a bit of a spicy/herbal after taste. Great when you need to be productive, focused, or functional. Provided a nice head buzz and light body relaxation that won't weigh you down. I only give it a lower rating because the high was consistently light and faded fast.”"
Ryno602,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1282147,"“Love this strain. Has an immediate pain relief effect and also has a slight heady buzz for a stoner bonus.”"

theduck,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1220633,"“very dense a awesome trichome formation. takes beautiful photos. my sample was sadly over dried and thus lost most of its flavor. still a great pleasure to smoke or just drool at.”"
Beerblebrox,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1289143,"“I'm giving three stars because I love the way I feel during the high  (relaxed, happy, talkative), but for some reason, this strain leaves me extremely anxious the following day. It happens so consistently that had to stop smoking it. It seems to have the same effect on my fiancé, but our roommate is fine on it (it's his favorite), so probably just different people having different reactions.”"

NovaScotiaBudMan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1347975,"“Smoking this strain is like the feeling of slipping into your sleeping bag after a long day of backcountry hiking, while carrying a canoe. 

Excellent relaxation and pain relief. Melts  away stress. Good bedtime medicine.”"

Pottna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-romulan/reviews/1282310,"“The flower has a slightly earthy aroma, yet the nugs were very frosty and eye appealing.  The smell when ground up was fresh and slightly sweet.  The smoke was smooth but the after taste was slightly a little earthier than I probably would've preferred.  I should say I prefer sativa strains snd love the citrus flavor.  I am very pleased with this strain nonetheless.”"
