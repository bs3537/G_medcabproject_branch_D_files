The smell it has is unlike anything I've ever smelled before; it pierces your nostrils. Taste wise, it was incredible. Every puff was sweet and tingly. Then, the best part: the high. White Rhino gives a high that will make you regret not mortgaging your house for a sweet bag. Its simply splendid.”"

There is also a head high that causes me to really zone out. Staring at the TV, without turning it on first.

KyleFromVanIsle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-rhino/reviews/1345962,"“Very colourful buds - brighter green with true orange hairs. The smell was awesome, like candy dusted with sugar powder. It sort of reminded me of green crack in that regard. 

Tasty to smoke too. Nice stuff and a very decent buzz. The hybrid side of this strain is probably why the buds look like they do and it probably is a strong contributor to the amazing smell and taste.
