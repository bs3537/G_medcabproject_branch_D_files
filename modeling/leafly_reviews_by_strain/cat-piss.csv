Snoozletoesx,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cat-piss/reviews/1092046,"“All I can say is, this is not good marijuana. The high is so short lived, you often catch yourself saying, "Did I just smoke?" This weed also smells, and tastes like "Cat Piss", it's pretty good for a strain to live up to its name and all, but this bud is called "cat piss". Horrible weed , its lucky to get a [4].”"

linkasaurusrex,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cat-piss/reviews/1173748,"“Not a bad high, but made me feel more paranoid than others. Literally smells like cat piss, you can taste the grape notes in it a lot though. Didn't take a lot to feel a good high.”"

inditiva0,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cat-piss/reviews/1337905,"“Not for the weak-nosed as it really does have a strong, pungent, hint of piss smell to it, however it tastes great- very earthy. High is fantastic - uplifting, focused, clear vision, munchies. Takes out headaches better than Excedrin.”"
NomadsFantasyland,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cat-piss/reviews/1337904,"“Arguably my all time favorite strain. I have found it's very good to split a bowl with a bud and then jam your heart out, you're guaranteed to have a great time and make some sweet music. Aside from that, the smell and taste aren't that bad and one batch even tasted closer to a soup than anything else. A great uplifting high with slight body high attributes sometimes.”"
SnowjobKush,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cat-piss/reviews/1634460,"“The first high grade Cannabis I even experienced at a kid was a no name strain that held the strong alien cat piss aroma and flavor.  It always reminded me of that floating green island level of Tomb Raider 2.    I thought high grade strains were overhyped until that point.  I still like the basic skunk, spice, hash, sugar, cedar flavors of reggie, but why settle?  When there's cat piss to be grown,  go for the good ...”"

WHen I smelled this strain for the first time I thought there was some chemical put on it until I started seeing it in different places. But I just dont get why people keep this strain around! I guess you gotta have some nasty flavors too!...Like the yellow and orange starburst! LOL”"
Jaybone28,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cat-piss/reviews/1197648,"“I give it one star because it was a potent smoke. With so many other great smelling,  tasting choices out there, why this? If I wanted to taste and smell catpiss I'd stick my face in the catbox”"
