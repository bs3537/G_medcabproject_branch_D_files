pragmatic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1302695,"“Currently, this is my favorite strain. It's a perfect amount of relaxation combined with euphoria and still pockets of energy. In my opinion, this is what a hybrid should feel like. I don't get too fuzzy on this strain either, so I can still hang out, get work done and carry decent conversations. If I was stuck on a deserted island and could only have one strain for the rest of my life, this would be it.”"
pragmatic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1334031,"“I have yet to enjoy a hybrid like this. This has been my "go to" and  will continue to be this way for a while. Right now if anyone asked me what bowl I would smoke if I had all the options in the world. This one would be it.”"

Bikachu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1489820,"“LOVE LOVE LOVE this strain! I have it in a vapor cartridge and it's amazing for daily use. I have chronic migraine and severe depression and anxiety and it is a God-send. It's like a lorazepam but without feeling too tired. Very mild head in the clouds feeling but not groggy tired.”"

JeeH,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1624130,"“Good for:  Beginner smokers & the anxious

Pros:  Super mild, relaxing.  Starts off in the body, but does get a bit psycho-active after about half an hour...leaves you relaxed & happy.  "High" lasts about 2 hours and then...

Cons: I get a headache 2 hours after smoking.   Taken at night I have weird, unpleasant dreams.”"

elybelly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1244781,"“Completely a pleasant, mild body high. Good for relaxation, pain relief, and sleep.”"
dustinreyes10,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1249867,"“so far my favorite strain I've smoked. This strain completely allows me to relax after a stressful day and takes away my anxiety. Top shelf medicine at its finest.”"
newkidoncellblocktango,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1241565,"“bought it from my local dispensary and wished I hadn't. For one thing it gave me no kind of relaxing buzz or pain relief. it just did nothing for me.”"
gayleadele,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1279637,"“Beautiful flower but doesn't quite keep me high long. The relaxation kicks in immediately but doesn't help with sleep much. Happy high though for a short amount of time.”"
Vaden,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1394908,"“Very fun strain to smoke. For me, it made me very productive, cleaned my room and went for a jog. But also very giggly, went to taco bell with my friend and we were laughing so hard in line that we couldn't order food. Very slow head high, takes about 20 mins to get built, at least for me.”"
NoobyGyrl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1244881,"“Good. Mellow yet happy. Laughing historically but calm.”"
Heathurmarie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1521852,"“One of the only strains that really helps me. I have severe anxiety, and suffer from depersonalization / derealization. Marijuana usually makes these issues worst, but this gives a nice relaxing feeling. As one user said, its like a antianxiety medication, without the script.”"

MindRite,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1265403,"“-Almost entirely without any psychoactive elements, this strain is a top notch anti-inflammatory.
-Very earthy and woody, these flowers taste of sweet grass when vaporized.
-A very relaxed, positive, and mellow feeling.
-One of the absolute best medicinal strains available!”"
DattKiddKFC,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1307946,"“I loved it. I picked it up because I head it was very helpful for insomnia. I've never had better nights of rest. Definitely recommend to someone searching for that one thing that helps you rest.”"
mad_jer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1581499,"“My all-time favorite. Perfect for relaxing a bit between getting home from work and cooking dinner...where you can take the edge off completely but still be able to function clearly. It's the best of every world and all I'd ever buy if given the choice.”"
EnricoPalazzo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/yummy/reviews/1535890,"“A true gem of a strain. Delicious citrus flavors leads to a real mellow head high (7%thc) but an amazing body high (10%cbd). Great bedtime strain.”"
