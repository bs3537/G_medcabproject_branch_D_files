PotsterBoy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/g-13/reviews/1413268,"‚ÄúVersatile strain when wanting that extra strong pain and stress relieve by itself or, as I have found, mixed with other strains.  
I like to mix with a High-CBD strain (IMC-Blue Suede Shoes) to get the immediate pain and stress relief without feeling stoned or much affected.
It also works well with evening/night strains (IMC - Mr Nice, GG4 or Skywalker) to intensify their sleep-inducing effects.

I smoked it for the first time yesterday with 2 buddies we had only 1.1 - 1.2 grams but still three bowl packs got us nice and stoned.

TheThreeEyedCrow,https://www.leafly.com/indica/g-13/reviews/1341737,"‚ÄúMy all-time favorite strain. I'm mostly a night time smoke. I  smoke after work. I use this strain to help relieve pain in my surgically repaired knee and for arthritis in my left hand. Music sounds phenomenal while on the high ride of G13. You can also get quite hungry.
