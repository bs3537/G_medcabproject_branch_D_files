dasheeda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-skunk/reviews/1399490,"“"Popping my strain review cherry" with Purple Skunk. This, after nearly 6 months of being a MMJ patient in AZ. I figured I needed to be a bit more knowledgeable about what worked best for my body before I started adding reviews. Overall, in my line of work, I am most productive when I can be relaxed and focused at the same time. I test sativas for this primarily and have found a few favs.

toltexican,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-skunk/reviews/1379592,"“A true contender for "grand-champion" of most, if not all, strains. Very, very head-oriented, though the body does it's best to catch up. And FAST. This strain tends to produce more psychedelic effects, which can be intense for the uninitiated. 

This is one of my favourite strains of all-time, as no matter what tolerance one has, this strain repeatedly puts MMJ patients in their place.”"
MedicinalMagic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-skunk/reviews/1259923,"“Purple Skunk is a hybrid Sativa dominant. 87.5% Sativa and 12.5% Indica.  It's a cross between Purple#1 and early Skunk..

It's a nice uplifting high, with slight mellow relaxation.

Strong skunky and earthy taste when smoked or vapored.”"
Raexe7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-skunk/reviews/1416215,"“Pretty fucking intense high. Smoked it with a couple of friends and they just couldn't take it... It's more of a high you want to enjoy on your own or play old school jams to while painting in your room- not a social smoke. Pretty trippy... if you have a low weed tolerance I suggest you slow down on it as within maybe 3-4 hits you're pretty high. Definitely stinky. Sort of body numbing, not really sufficient for pain...”"
Beebe420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-skunk/reviews/1150085,"“This is one of my favorites to grow. It is probably the prettiest girl in the room. Short, sweet, and FULL of trichs, even at the early stages. The smell is strong, and the pungent skunk aroma leaves the nose longing for another wiff. Definately a well developed and proud girl. Her flower time is usually 9 weeks there about, although she seemingly could go longer, my best results are around 9. The bud swell is like n...”"

smoovmoov,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-skunk/reviews/1336531,"“Love this strain. It makes me horny as hell.

Chilled me out and helped my mood”"

Olor amargo/agrio sabor entre uvas terrosas y con peculiar olor secundario a Skunk básico. Cogollos color purpura con verde a sus diferentes tonalidades a días de secado.
Alto nivel de THC con efecto muy relajante, pero ansioso. Gran facilidad de manejo en seco.”"

If you love skunk and purple's you love this strain sweet lavender grape taste long lasting 2hr dosage from a medicinal piece.

I'm not a huge fan of sativa or sativa dom because of the intense head buzz, but this strain isn't bad for daytime. Gives me a little lift during the day like i just drank a soda. I wouldnt use for nighttime, just keeps me up.”"

Spacey and relaxing but not too high just more chill but can still focus a bit as i am writing this but definitely gave me a heavy buzz - scaled at 100 I would give it an 83 or B grade or a high 4.
