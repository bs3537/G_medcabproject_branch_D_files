OCAs Cloud 9
=============
rickmon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ocas-cloud-9/reviews/1380709,"“This is my favorite strain to smoke.  It can be energizing and motivating if used moderately.  It is ridiculously strong and can get away from you in a hurry.  I will take just one hit and enjoy the effects for up to 4 hours.  It enhances my creativity, problem solving, and humor. 

Warning: be advised that it is easy to overdue it with this strain.  I have seen heavy cannabis users get seriously lit when smoking sev...”"

A very uplifting and energetic high for me.  Had me laughing for a good long time.

Loved this strain.  I wasn't trying for any medical purposes, so I can't remark on that.

I got it at The Herbal Connection”"

The strain provided me intense body relaxation but kept my mind active and energetic. Very relaxed and engaged with out "sofa lock!" 

Will be looking for more products from OCA!”"

Chooks,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ocas-cloud-9/reviews/1380715,"“I'm a casual user, so when I do smoke, I like to be active. I just had a two-hour battle with my dog while he tried desperately to get the laser. Did I enjoy this strain? Damn right I did. You should too.”"
PaintedFanatic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ocas-cloud-9/reviews/1476267,"“One of my all time favorite strains.  I picked this up at my dispensary a couple weeks ago, because it was new.  It's an incredibly happy high, that goes both to the head and body.  Not to mention the buds are gorgeous, and smell/taste amazing.  

10/10, would recommend this strain to anyone”"

Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ocas-cloud-9/reviews/1513469,"“Good strain- but as others have mentioned it can get away from you if you smoke too much. In moderate doses it is a pretty clear headed sativa heavy experience. With too much it gets overly racy. I personally prefer my Sativa hybrids with some euphoria though. Which this lacked for me.”"
smokemuchey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ocas-cloud-9/reviews/1399439,"“Unique strain by the Oregon Cannabis Authority. Cloud 9 gives a powerful high that is carefree, warm and blissful-"sweet" even, possibly stimulating the same pleasure receptors in my brain as if I were eating a very tasty desert.  This is the type of strain I would save to bring out during dinner parties or other social events. I would also use this as a daily medicine as it is an all around great strain.”"
