DarthVapor,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lavender-haze/reviews/1366416,"“I picked up an 8th of this from Phoenix Caregivers in Arizona. This is a VERY powerful haze.  I tried a few tokes and am very hazy. But also very focused and aware. This is a must have for any Haze fan. I tried Purple Haze before and this is right up there, more powerful tho. I will append this if things change, but so far. Its a 9/10.. Pick some up before its gone. I'll try to add pics later. Peace and Pot.”"

It's like Leafly states, nice for late afternoon, evening for a relaxed, uplifting mood. Excited I got over a half of this 😁”"

Prosparody,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lavender-haze/reviews/1663490,"“Not a very clean high, caused confusion and agitated psychosis/paranoia. Tasted harsh and smelled bad. Could have been a bad batch but I'm not trying it again.”"

I agree with the info on this page, it makes me feel happy and I can get a lot done. I feel like it helps me think abstractly so it's great for writing, art projects, daydreaming, or making laundry seem fun. I absolutely love the lavender-y smell and floral taste.
