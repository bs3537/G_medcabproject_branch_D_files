pnlcooper,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1412915,"“I was not really sure I liked this one at all, came as recommendation here on leafly based on my favs. It made me really wired, which strong sativas tend to do. I was off the walls with this one. I was talking 200 miles a minutes so I annoyed a few people, sorry.”"
ishmale,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1417933,"“I picked up about a 1/4 of this in Hollywood from 7262 Collective and it was HEAVEN. I highly recommend using it sparingly to maintain its great,cerebral high, because if you smoke it all day you'll get used to its effects and it won't feel so special. But yeah, after maybe 2 or 3 bangs out of my one hitter, I felt like I was on cloud 9  and was incredibly social and euphoric! I liked loading this in the mornings and...”"

gr1m5,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1392888,"“Beautiful. Absolutely covered in opaque and amber trichomes and a notably large amount of bright orange to red pistils weaved throught the bud. Smelled fruity, with hints of peach, orange and mango. It smelled so sweet that it could of passed for candy.  It didn't taste as good as it smelled but it didn't taste bad either, just more of an earthy taste. Surprisingly smooth for how potent it was. Bud structure was fluf...”"

kfischer87,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1417935,"“My favorite daytime strain so far, which is saying something because I love Sativas and/or Sativa dominant hybrids and have tried quite a few. Love the boost in energy & motivation. And love just the overall mental vibe with CJ which isn't racy/tweaky/over-analytical like some other (cough cough.. Green Crack). IMO obviously. But definitely recommend!”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1503268,"“I expected a strong sativa buzz, I felt slightly energized for about ten minutes after each dab. 
The taste is more like green crack than Jack herer. Will be waking and baking with this strain in the morning when  I have a clean pallet before trying it again.
If you need an energizing sativa get this one, but lower your expectations”"
longolola,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1412916,"“This is my go to sativa, and overall favorite strain.  The smell and flavor are divine, but hard to describe, like citrus rain, and each bud is sticky and covered in trichomes, ruining my grinder.  I'm lucky enough to live two miles from Santa Cruz Mountain Naturals, which bred the strain, and I make sure I keep plenty in stock for the rare times they're out.”"

ais17,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1458060,"“This is a great high for going to class and doing homework. I retained a lot of information and stayed focused. I would say there is slight paranoia but maybe that's just me. Overall, it's a good one in my book.”"
oglos420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1375072,"“It's very woodsy with lemony hints. Heady high, energetic, thoughts on 100mph. No major munchies like some other strains. I consider this a party strain, that you can smoke while socializing and drinking without getting couch locked and tired.”"
JDukart13,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1315367,"“I absolutely love this strain. Be careful because like Jack the Ripper it can creep up on you and make you way higher than you think you are. However, I have to say for a sativa I was totally relaxed and in a very good mood. Combined it with some lemon cookies in a raw cone for a nice relaxing night with my buddy. Will be looking out for this.”"

rsrkm,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1278347,"“Pretty sweet high, I smoked a joint with a friend and I soon became really really dizzy and happy, I was dizzy for around 5 minutes before coming down to a normal high.”"
grillbilly,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1065198,"“I love this strain. As a big fan of sativas, this is top notch.  One of my favorites I have tried to date, best of herer and green crack. If you wanna get stuff done, this is a great one!”"
purplegreenpanda,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1413063,"“tastey , slightly even better taste than jack herer itself and that's my fav. this may be my new fav?!”"
Carnicerobryan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1662715,"“A delicious smelling strain. Definitely hits hard, I took 3 hits off a joint and that was more than plenty. I recommend a try.”"
TheOfficeOC,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1478048,"“With this Flower's parents being the  strains we know and love , Jack Herer, and Green Crack.

From what I can remember, this strain was a very exiting, bouncy, clean & sharp sativa. At the time of this review, I have not tried either GC, or JH alone, so I'm unsure of how it stacks up against it's own genetics. However, it was hands-down one of the best pure sativa strains I have tried yet...Outside of the wired/gotta go feeling.”"

I am very sensitive to any kind of paranoia and anxiety and this strain works wonders for that! It makes me feel very happy, uplifting and that I can tackle anything the day has to offer.

Lapidation,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cracker-jack/reviews/1143773,"“first time trying this strain.
the focus and attentiveness are short lasting and I felt very engaging for a bit.
thoughts and creative ideas were flowing quickly until the comedown. I felt very tired and lazy an hour after smoking roughly 2 bowls.
I did play 4 hours of hockey before so that could be a contributing factor.

as for the bud itself it may differ location wise, however its a solid sativa.”"
