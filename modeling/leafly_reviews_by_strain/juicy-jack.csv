JJ (as I will call it) is not only the best strain I have smoked to date, it is also the most beautiful! This is my kind of smoke, the KINDRED as they called it 25 years ago! Uplifting, creative, focused and in charge! Berry flavor with some Citrus from the Herrer but also earthy! A big tip of the cap to these growers, expensive but worth every dime! AAAAAAAA+++++++...”"

I was vaping this with my honey and both of us were instantly wrapped up in it. The euphoria hits after about 20 minutes. My back pain was gone almost instantly. A good Sativa rush of creative thoughts followed. Though this has a higher THC than other Jack crosses, the effects are pretty much done in a couple of hours. Not long lasting, but super intense. I slept b...”"
HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/juicy-jack/reviews/1346563,"“Another descendent of the highly popular Jack Herer lineage. Juicy Jack maintains the same great effects of its famous predecessor, and I dig the citrusy scent and the sweet lightly berry flavored smoke. Regarding its effects, Juicy is a pure hybrid with a euphoric and heady first impression. But, the low notes kick in eventually, and the experience slowly tapers off; eventuating in a pleasant state of mind.”"

Got my mind going though. And had some good creative thoughts. Probably won't get again because who wants a headache”"

DrFrankenshroom,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/juicy-jack/reviews/1752085,"“The first time I tried it hit me like a brick shithouse.
I felt a bit dizzy and nauseous. (Though I thought this dizziness could have been from dialysis )It is was ok. It mellowed me out . Other times smoked , it did not hit as hard.”"
