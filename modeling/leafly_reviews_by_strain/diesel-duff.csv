Time seems to slow down significantly in that my thoughts take less time than usual. I thought of The Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley and understood what he had been explaining throughout the entire book.

Definitely more of a daytime strain that's great for any anxiety or stress I might have, also, I really want to go to the beach :)”"

Pleasant to vape. Crisp feel/taste with cool kick at end.

A solid sativa feel left me clear-headed in a good mood with motivation to get some things done (all while enjoying doing those things.) But able to tune it down. This could be a good daytime med. go-to.  Not great for sleeping.”"

Being a PTSD victim I recommend it for mellow wake and bakes. I had it in Co2 extracted crumble form. Good flavor but thats to be with all low temp Co2 wax.”"

My only problem with this strain is it's more of a "chill weed" and it leaves me feeling more lazy than creative. Great strain for smoking before bed if theres something on your mind or there's something you've been stressed out about.”"
