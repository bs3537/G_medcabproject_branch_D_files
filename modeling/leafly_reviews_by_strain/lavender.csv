Gonff,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1394079,"“My first time getting red eyes from MMJ. It wasn't too bad, but I've been vaping for a few months now and this is the first time. 

Lavender totally took away my chronic back pain and inflammation (ankylosing spondylitis). Works quickly and seems to last. 

I was very happy, chatty and giggly. A very pleasant head experience.”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1418972,"“Very slow come on. Feel loose and wavy. Relaxed and somewhat giddy, but too laid back to do much. Vision is clear and RICH! Everything is really cozy and satisfying. Good tingly/fizzy body high. Very able to concentrate. A buzzy, soapy, melty physical high. Great for learning...all you want to do is kick back and absorb compelling stuff. Had an utterly fabulous time reading towards the end. Probably the best strain f...”"
PotMama,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1418973,"“I love this strain. Seriously. I love it! Great for insomnia -- I'm usually up until about 1 AM and then up by around 7 AM for the day. After smoking this, I was asleep by 10 last night! It stops my migraines, nausea, stomach pain, and chest pain associated with stress and anxiety. It calms me right down when I feel like I'm getting overwhelmed or frustrated. Definitely a strain I will keep handy!!”"
TriniFairieTrueHeart,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1414954,"“Lavender Kush is an awesome Indica.   Nice mellow flavor.    Good for Asthma.    Not harsh at all.    I use a vaporizer that uses a very small amount, .    Got home at about 3:00, had a tube and haven't needed to medicate again.    It alleviated the ripping Fibromyalgia pains in my back quickly!   Thanks to the Budtender that suggested it.”"
Vbjess,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1381640,"“This is one of my favorite strains. Perfect for the chronic pain patient who also suffers from insomnia, muscle spasms, and anxiety, this strain does not mess around. It is very strong and you will be asleep in two hours or less. As far as I'm concerned, this is like the xyrem of medical cannabis. My sleep, pain, and anxiety have all improved since starting mmj last year, but I've yet to find anything as potent for n...”"

DieselDude420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1379876,"“Pro:  Smooth to smoke.  Relaxed and anxious at the same time ... maybe back and forth for the first half hour, and then you immediately fall into a very relaxed and heavy state.   Definitely tingle there in the beginning.  You aren't wantin to do much on this - TV and Computer surfing Craigslist might be in the cards with this one.   Won't even want to get up and get some food.  You also feel VERY relaxed the next mo...”"

kmarie00,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1370839,"“The bud was fluffy-soft but dense, purple with lots of hairs and crystals and tasted like flowers or berries. The mind high is exceptional; music and art is an ideal thing to indulge in while high on this strain. I feel great.”"

CannabisKingOG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1546319,"“Lavender is an exceptional strain. It gave me a strong head buzz for about thirty minutes. During that time, I can feel the nerve passages in my face and neck receiving nerve impulses. It feels like a mellow vibration. Lavender made me very talkative with friends. That may be because I am a flamboyant extrovert, but I digress. After the initial effects, the classic indica traits come out and I begin looking for a pla...”"
SirBronn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1375027,"“Lavender is a great reminder for me to not give up on a strain after a bad first time. I first tried Lavender in early  November after hearing good things. It was awful. So dry and unpleasant it was like smoking bad potpourri. This cut is from Grow ops farms in Washington State. The bud easily is one of the best looking buds so far in the rec market. A Bob Ross-esque cacophony of purples,pink, orange,and of course  g...”"

deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1346624,"“🌺🌻 Lavender is a unique indica with a potent floral aroma. The dense, dark buds are covered in crystals and it has a nice spice to it. It tastes a bit like lavender during the exhale. Appropriately named, it comes from Big Skunk Korean, Afghani Hawaiian and Lavender Kush. Perfect for relaxing and putting a busy mind at ease. This is a wonderful strain with a very interesting flavor.”"

ampersans,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1388353,"“This strain is incredibly relaxing. As a naturally anxious/paranoid smoker, this stuff completely changed my idea of smoking entirely.

It’s heavy and intoxicating - great for relaxation and de-stressing.  It also made me a bit sleepy which was quite nice as not all of the heavier strains do.  I really loved the flavor and effect - just what I needed after a stressful day at work.”"

hemlocklily,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1365253,"“This was a nice indica, not too strong but not weak either. It would make a decent first strain for someone new, but it makes the cut for experienced users also. I found it quite smooth on my throat, and calming.”"
StateofMorgan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1371867,"“One of our staples, a strain my girlfriend and I smoke several times a week. It's our go-to before bed weed. It tastes really good, makes you feel super relaxed, and gives an incredible body high. We had some of the best sex ever on this stuff, my body was so responsive and sensitive I almost couldn't stand it, lol.”"
enhoel,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1477092,"“This is my favorite indica strain. It’s perfect for a mild daytime high, or with a heavier dose, it’s excellent for easing insomnia and nighttime anxiety. I love lavender 👌”"

Extremely pungent when grounds, lavender (obviously), vanilla and fruit scents abound. Light, pine-green with medium density large orange hair. Smoked in a glass pipe. Fairly unobtrusive smoke, no heavy planty or other flavors. Slightly flowery finish.

Immediate body high. Couch lock begins soon after with great focusing effect. Would be good for those stu...”"

I've been looking for a strain that knocks me out and I've found it!
It makes me feel like I've worked out all day, my body is just tingly and numb, about 45-60 minutes later, I'm pretty much ready for a snack and bed.. lol

So far, the best strain I've had for insomnia..”"

truthbringer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1414656,"“Dispensary: The Holister Center

Upon purchasing the 8th I bought it smelled decent enough but this dispensary isn't really known in having buds with decent structure so my choice was based more off my budtenders recommendation and my nose.

Back to the bud.. it was dry, tasteless, and fairly harsh on the inhale. I've had the strain before but this had to have been one of the worst batches I've ever come across.”"

Wisdom222,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lavender/reviews/1415259,"“This strain is great for sleepless nights or for those suffering from insomnia. The high is definitely slow to come. You won't feel high until after your bowl or joint is done. Very chill, very mellow high. Great for relaxing or just hanging out not doing much that requires physical activity. Not bad, but not one the greatest for me personally.”"
