White Durban
=============
LotusKai,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1397546,"“I love this strain. The cross of Whitefire OG with Durban Poison was an excellent idea and produced a wonderful strain.

This bud has the whole package down. The smell is that of Durban with a sweeter pungent undertone to it and breaking open a bud is almost intoxicating itself. The buds are extremely dense and dusted in white trichomes. It breaks down surprisingly easy for such dense bud; evenly too not clumpy or in...”"

a4hair,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1397547,"“Providing a euphoric, energetic high, White Durban is a wonderful strain for an early morning or a detail-oriented task requiring mental clarity.

Aroma: Sweet
Flavor: Woody”"
paddyw,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1398736,"“Great sativa for studying or focusing. If you need a task-oriented high, this is something you should check out. This helps with the anxious feelings -- find something to do. 

Taste is very light and citrusy, great for a morning bake.”"
Rubeckscube62316,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1397548,"“Phenomenal smell. Nice light and fluffy nugs. The taste is fantastic. All around amazing strain! Would recommend this for any person looking for a daytime smoke.”"
iBobs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1397549,"“White Durban by Fireline in Washington State. Tested at 33.4% THC.
This sativa dominant is beautiful and potent.
Light fluffy green buds covered in trichomes and orange hairs.
The aroma is a sweet and woody blend with hints of citrus on the surface, and a rich, pungent, earthy smell once broken down.
The inhale leaned towards harsh, with a light citrus flavor, while the exhale exhibited woody and earthy notes, also a...”"

Thus I write a review. Nature is extra awesome- music as well.  Great enhancer . On my top 5 list.”"
Roo182,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1359532,"“What a great strain. I felt really fantastic smoking this, made me functional, happy, a little more focused and not too hungry which is a bonus. Woody/Leafy fresh taste.”"

Witch0fthewilds,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1539177,"“Great strain if you are looking for a productive high. I really enjoy the the chill but awake feeling this gives you. would be great in the morning for a wake n bake with a cup of coffee. Has a little bit of a sneak up so the first time smoking I got super stoned. But even so I felt productive throughout it.”"

Kourim,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1334937,"“Durban Poison with a twist is how I describe this strain. Maybe Durban Poison with a punch is better. The effects are DP like with an extra stony edge. I am still very uplifted, but my mind wanders a bit more than with Durban Poison.
Dense nugs, with an earthy, pine and citrus taste.
Recommended.”"
sumanth,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1378084,"“This one is so good that made me write a review. One hell of a strain... users beware this one is super strong. Would definitely recommend this to a seasoned smoker”"

I picked this up yesterday at Kushside in Everett, WA as 2 .5 gram pre-rolls marked @ 29% THC through Fireline ( and for anyone that knows there flower it's always consistently great stuff and I can honestly say for myself anytime I have ever purchased there flower I've never been disappointed) which is cheap for them so was pumped then again Kushside always has cheap deals :) Anyways I struggle with PTSD an...”"

Strong chronic pain relief, and intense euphoric sensations.  Had laser like focus, my mood was uplifted and got sleepy near the end of the buzz..”"

FiggyPirate,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1339554,"“The high in his strain is good, energizing and heady. But the next morning headache and hangover is so awful for me. I don't think it's worth it. won't be buying this strain again.”"

PoignantTips,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1348335,"“procured a beautiful specimen grown by fireline. I don't review a whole lot of sativas but this one keeps me coming back. it has a very pungent aroma like a strong musk. virtually no sweetness to this one. heavy-hitting as well so expect to cough and look stoned as yum (i.e. red, glossy eyes). overall the high was euphoric and unbelievably cerebral. good times.”"
NippleAction88,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1383725,"“Quality quality strain. A few extra bucks per gram but totally worth it. Great daytime smoke that tastes great. All you need is a pinch in the bowl and you will be set for hours. Very potent and lasts a long time.”"
ultrapop,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-durban/reviews/1732700,"“Took one rip off the bong and it’s all you need! NOT for new smokers. Small size coated with kief buds and is very nice for a wake n bake. Grab a coffee and wake up with this one! Five stars”"
