Theonewhoknocks420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-kush/reviews/1214882,"“Strain has a great smell, like a California forest. Only one bowl and you are in a heavy high in both mind and body, which gives you the choice of either choosing activities or sleeping. It is not a super high, but it will take away most pains in an instant. Great for stomach pain and anxiety. Helps with Tinnitus too. Don't smoke too much, you'll get real paranoid real fast. Lots of this in CO right now too. Hope thi...”"

eclecticsupernova,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-kush/reviews/1379759,"“This Strain tends to leave me in some what of a head fog. I love it for night time or lazy day use. I do however tend to get a headache if too much is consumed.”"

JimiTalent,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-kush/reviews/1561261,"“This is a great strain for people who are dealing with pain but still need to get shit done, unlike most indicas I don't get any couch lock, it's almost like a sativa with the pain relief of an indica.”"

TheeParrisHill,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-kush/reviews/1225668,"“Got a batch of this under the assumption it was its Green Crack Sativa alternate which obviously was not the case. Ive since switched it to my evening time batch where it lay best for me. For a evening time its really not bad at all. Not one of my favorites but certainly not bad. It does produce a certain level of brain fog and the taste is rather bitter for my taste buds however that aside id say this is a smoke bet...”"

greenerportland,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-kush/reviews/1390730,"“When I first say GK I was not very excited. However, the smell was wonderful, the taste waste yummy, and I was moving around and doing stuff. Incredibly sticky and dense. The high for me lasted hours on very little and I found myself smoking less.”"

muenzbep,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-kush/reviews/1062135,"“Hit fast!  One B load and I was on my way, walking of course.  A bit of anxious paranoia as the mental kicked in, mellowed out while walking outside, serious cottonmouth.  Generally gentle but powerful high, awake, bright eyed, music is genius.  Go for a hike, find a new hobby, make dinner for loved ones and sleep content.”"
RainSen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-kush/reviews/1541834,"“some strain to relax to. well.... let's say just not to have any task that requires focus. it's hard. But washing the dishes, looking into the phone for hours or humping the wife are good things to do while being on this strain. A very very nice body sensation and a mindset to be surely not distracted by thoughts. have food and beverages ready and you'll have a good time!”"
perseverantone,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-kush/reviews/1380254,"“it could really use another round of cross breeding to.bring more of the energizing buzz of green cracking to the forefront. had great smell and taste.  doc oc, lovely dense spreads far.  tastes fits description. it ends in eventual slight burnt out feeling.  cross this with some quality Nigerian haze and you got a winner”"

IndicaPeace,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-kush/reviews/1279862,"“Green Kush is cerebral & I am all for cerebral. I tried it out & about the city so the relaxing body feel simply mellowed me out & kept a smile on this face. Good for retreating under the covers or a weekend at home, feet tucked & some good food! Maybe a friend or two. I can dig it!”"
