BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/trap-star/reviews/1586856,"“I've seen this strain popping up all over in AZ dispensaries, so of course I had to try it.
I really dig The Cube, the one parent. Which is in another strain I love but can't think of the name right now.
Totally awesome night time strain, only half of the time it keeps me awake. But only because I enjoy this strains high.
Strains like this are going to make me sad I'm moving to a state with no medical marijuana in a ...”"

To be specific this was TrapStar #4 grown by NorthWest Pearl. The smell when you open the jar is sweet and intoxicating, the first hit you take you can immediately feel the head rush and are left with a delicious aftertaste and a very relaxing head and body high. This is...”"

So they germanted in about 20 hours of sitting in dark cold water all 12 were good. So far my Gorilla Glue× Mandarin Sunset strain called Citrul Glue and my Trap.Star are the biggest largest baby's I have. I can tell they are going to be monsters.. thanks to the cube father gens they grow big and fast. Will let u know how they turn o...”"
mmjmomlegalizeit81,https://www.leafly.com/indica/trap-star/reviews/1585029,"“Trap Star is an Indica strain with the genetics of LA OG Kush and The Cube. The phonetype I have definitely leans on the LA OG parentage in which you can tell by its Pine and Diesel terpenes (there is a whiff of sweetness in there--cherries I think?). The buds aren't huge but very dense and drenched in frosty trichromes which is a must have for me. I have flower and my method of consumption is my bong. I had two hits...”"

KHBuds1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/trap-star/reviews/1581190,"“I got Trap Star from a local dispensary in Michigan. It has a definite Kushy smell to it. Light green flower with a few a few orange pistils throughout. Very strong Indica. Definitely helps with my chronic back pain.”"

Sunrise Wellness, Vancouver B.C.
$15/g

I knew I was in for a treat after my first puff. Classic heavy kush terpenes but with a bit of twist. The buds were majestically caked with trichomes. Sticky with a delicious and rich aroma.

Effects are instant and potent. I could almost feel the dopamine surge as I savored the smoke.
Euphoric and a very effective night time sleeper.

I love my hea...”"

This time we smoked a shatter joint (Trap Star shatter and flower) and I loved it. Heavy OG/ diesel taste, heavy OG effects. Starts out with a spacy head high and then just bulldozes your body. Sleep shortly after.”"
Gomez9741,https://www.leafly.com/indica/trap-star/reviews/1733962,"“Trap Star was on the top tier at a local AZ spot , had to pick some up after a whiff.. 
It delivered & I felt great . 
Picked up more the next day”"
dedwerkz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/trap-star/reviews/1665864,"“Purchased from Swell on Camelback Road, this batch was from Copperstate Farms. The Strain had an excellent taste and an excellent smoke. Floral notes and an almost juicy flavor was left on the mouth and tongue after a moderate bowl. The high came on suddenly and was very pleasurable. I don't recommend this strain for low tolerance or newer smokers and definitely not a daytime strain.”"
MeliMed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/trap-star/reviews/1648104,"“This strain seems to react different but for me it is relaxing, therapeutic & taste good I really don't care for the diesel part of it. It is still good though :-)”"
MarkDogg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/trap-star/reviews/1687271,"“Trap star is amazing helps with pain after a long day.I got it at Az organix in shatter form If anyone is looking for a nice strain to relax this is it!”"
