It's not a "knock-you-off-your-chair" stone. It's more complex, but kind of lively. I really like to smoke this one when I'm playing my guitar.”"

derhop85,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-kripple/reviews/1359105,"“Smooth and mellow earthy flavor.  Good full body high the pain just melts away.  Great for meditation and sleep.  Definitely a couch bud.  Noticed some dizziness while moving around.  Moderate paranoia.”"

But at the same time I am calmly alert & peaceful A++”"

yodaoldschool,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-kripple/reviews/1344651,"“Blue kripple like them all sounds great but this is a strain I would stay away from. odour control was sadly to say not a problem this strain did not do it for me pain relief was not apparent”"
Dero666,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-kripple/reviews/1279310,"“Earthy aroma and physically relaxing.  One session pulling quite a few bowls I experienced some dizziness and nausea.  Other than that I'm not sure if I will visit that strain again.”"
