El Jefe
=============
vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/el-jeffe/reviews/1366681,"“Wow. Very strong, relaxing and sedating. Closed eye visuals with music. EXCELLENT PAIN RELIEF! I am really impressed! So sticky it gummed up my grinder. Very pungent, tasty, took a long time to fully vape a bowl. Dense- It looked quite small and compact.  
Went back for another bag the next day, because it will be gone fast.!

I never give 5 stars, but this is so good and I could not give a 4.75.”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/indica/el-jeffe/reviews/1415008,"“El Jefe (OG). High rushes on and continues to expand. There’s a streak of razor coolness and stable confidence that makes you feel in charge, yet easy going. Pretty bad-ass. I say streak because the majority of your mental space is erased, leaving you floating on euphorically tropical waters. It really does wipe your ability to concentrate. Your thought process just instantly evaporates, leaving you in a mindless stu...”"

Love this strain, it makes me feel better for almost 3 hours. Honestly I could be vomiting my brains out and puff this strain and feel better instantly and have a raging appetite in usually 15 minutes. Even I'll say the appetite simulation you get from El Jefe is intense.. This is coming from a chemo patient lol I usually can't handle th...”"
mmmmmmbeer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/el-jeffe/reviews/1378480,"“The smell coming off this bud is unreal - Meyer lemon, honey, and pine. The taste is similar, but with a spicy black pepper note. The high is a bit delayed, kicking in shortly after the last inhale. A gentle body high starts with a tingle behind the eyes and forehead. A little too anxiety provoking for me to rate 5 stars. Although this is a heavy indica, the high THC content (29% in this grow) and minimal CBD give th...”"
Miss_Hazey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/el-jeffe/reviews/1509736,"“Extremely Underrated.

Amazing taste and it's SUPER STRONG. I'd say it is one of the strongest weeds I've had the pleasure of smoking. Buds are completely loaded with crystal and beyond sticky. There are blackish hints throughout the bud, very exotic looking. The scent is crazy but I find it hard to describe. Hints of lemon/citrus, kinda sweet but very earthy/pungent. It's super complex. The taste is just as unique; ...”"
CharlesPeligro,https://www.leafly.com/indica/el-jeffe/reviews/1337548,"“As advertised by others. Euphoric & Relaxing without Sleepiness & Hunger.  Be sure to have a beverage nearby.

*That being said. As with any strain, whatever the label on the jar states is all you have to go by if it really is said strain.”"
Bongshifter,https://www.leafly.com/indica/el-jeffe/reviews/1274072,"“Very relaxing, meditative, and a good bedtime herb.”"
1kushking,https://www.leafly.com/indica/el-jeffe/reviews/1785972,"“El Jefe meaning "The Chief", is a 70% Indica with full fern tree green buds. Buds have thin, short, & brown pistils with crystal trichomes. Earthy, sweet lemon, & rich pine are the scents & flavors. Effects are relaxing, calm, & mellow with no couch lock. At the end of the day though it will ease you right into a good night's sleep. Happy Sedation :)”"
sharon.macywatson,https://www.leafly.com/indica/el-jeffe/reviews/1131098,"“There's a realy pleasant aftertaste.  This is a deep and mellow high, it'll lift your mood.  El Jeffe really IS the boss.”"

Trisha44,https://www.leafly.com/indica/el-jeffe/reviews/1313646,"“A sweet, almost floral scent was released during grinding. Dense, delicious buds. Really helps with 'living in the moment' because it reduces any deep thinking, worrying or stress. It hasn't taken away my body pain but kind of masks it, making it bearable. One possible negative is that I have a slight headache after smoking, which is rare for me. Tasty!”"

Audio_Geek,https://www.leafly.com/indica/el-jeffe/reviews/1265787,"“An incredibly powerful indica.  I was recommended this strain by a budtender at my local dispensary for some insomnia and restlessness I had been experiencing.  He was right -- not only did it relieve my anxiety and insomnia but I felt so relaxed that I felt as if I was becoming weightless. 

I believe that the genetics of this strain have been perfected; both the effects and taste are superb.  I will definitely buy ...”"

It gave me a relaxing and euphoric high, that brought on sleepiness an hour later.  This strain is great for pain releif as it helped with my muscle spasms and body pain, lowered my anxiety, slowed down my mind and helped me combat my insomnia.  I love this strain!!!”"

I picked it up at a local despensary because of the claimed THC content, %33.15.  I was skeptical but grabbed a gram.  Pine earthy flavors lead to an immediate sedate state and nodding off (no idea how long) bowl in hand after two... three?... hits.  Best thing for insomnia, man!”"

wishmaster,https://www.leafly.com/indica/el-jeffe/reviews/1271386,"“Very pungent, earthy odor, though not unpleasant. Extremely smooth inhale. Tasty exhale. The high was a slight creeper for me, but arrived with a swelling, powerful body and mind warmth. I think I have a relatively high tolerance for flower, and when I smoked two bowls of El Jefe I already had some THC in my system, so one would think the effects would be quite mild. Quite the contrary with this beauty.”"
