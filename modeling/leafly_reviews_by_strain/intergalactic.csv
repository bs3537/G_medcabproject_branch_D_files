As soon as you smell the sweet pine you already know your in for a treat, triched out frosty. Hits like a Mac truck beginners take it slow as for the veterans it’s going to leave you relaxed hungry and happy. Def would get again top shelf quality.”"

Truly and intergalactic high that leaves you floating. Very long lasting high and that's coming from a daily indica smoker. Pick this up if you ever see it. Top shelf approved✔️💨🌲”"

Details for me: it made my inner critical voice very loud- conflicts with my depression. Following days afterwards I couldn't formulate complex thoughts.

Gonna have to throw it away.”"
