I was traveling on the Max Train in downtown Portland when I realized I missed my stop by 4 stations!  I was in a Euphoric Day Dream! This Sativa Dominant Hybrid cross of  East Coast Sour D and AK-47 packs a 3-4 hour high! Love it!  Usually sells fast when in stock at your local dispensary!!!  Do not by pass if you like a euphoric buzz! Not a good ...”"

Makes me super euphoric and philosophical; super amusing thoughts popping into my head for hours. I also spent a lot of time watching Vines, to be fair.

But the best part is what it doesn't do. No dry mouth, no munchies, ...”"

The high is hazy and euphoric, as many other reviewers have stated. Smoking a decent amount of this would get you pretty out of it.”"

Always grown to perfection, its as easy to grow as any other sativa dominant, indoor or outdoor. We will soon have Black Betty-Jack Herer cross that is super tasty and very serious head and body medication. Black Betty will always be a great flavor and one could never go wrong in purchasing a few choice nugs.”"
