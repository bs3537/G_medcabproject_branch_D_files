Night Nurse

Mad_Styles,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1385685,"“This write up is slightly wrong, the strain was bred by BC Bud Depot  by one of their breeders in Sasketchewan using a three way cross of BCBD's Fire OG Kush, the BC Hashplant, and the Harmony from Reeferman. You can fact check this by referring to the Cannabis Cup award it received last year in Amsterdam from High Times as well as on their website.

This is a vigorous easy to grow quick finisher with a unique nose, ...”"
zuqaqipum,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1393591,"“This strain is underrated as a simple sleep-aid, Folks. It's an indica-lover's indica. It has a lot more than soporificity to offer across the board, but is most useful for me as a non-stupefying muscle relaxer and social anxiolytic. I actually find weed like this stimulating, but never shaded with paranoid jags. Don't expect roll-level euphoria, but for those who can ride it, it's a reliable and generally cost-effec...”"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1366515,"“Night Nurse is a great strain to induce sleep and treat pain. It leaves you with a totally relaxed, almost floating feeling. Pain melts away with this one. Would recommend to treat pain and insomnia.”"
JacobbTG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1378284,"“This is a godsend of a strain for insomniacs and people looking for a good night's rest. Smooth finish, pleasant taste, and the effects seem to begin peaking around 30 min, but the duration is much longer, around 2 hours. The strain is highly sedative so not one recommended for recreational activities or those looking for a burst of creativity. The strain features an extreme body high that is not overpowering but at ...”"
jediduck,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1378283,"“Love this strain. Suffer from insomnia and this has helped so much more than any other strain I have tried. I have only tried tried in concentrate form and it tastes great. Hope to try the flower soon.”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1387575,"“This is my third Night Nurse purchase. Bought it largely because I found the name delightfully creepy, and Hash Plant and Fire OG are both 🔥, but you don't even know fire until you've tried Night Nurse. Starts off with an immediate high and serious giggles. I stared at the cat and laughed for a good 5 minutes straight. Then it sort of... Cozies you into sleep. For me, sleep is inevitable with this one. Love love lov...”"
mgoncalves,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1366514,"“Night Nurse is an amazing strain, i love Fire OG which is also combined with night nurse. . It has helped me with my chronic pain i would recommend this as more of a night indica to smoke it will defiantly put you in sleeping mode if you have problems falling asleep,. One of my favourites.!”"
sywi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1576314,"“One of the two best I've had for the purpose of the purchase, which was basically instant  sleep. I'm trying to get off the benzos, and lying awake panicky and with scenarios of doom* re-playing pointlessly in my head has not been helping. And I just hate trying to fall asleep. I seldom can when I should -- natural night person -- and the whole "lie sleepless and alone with my thoughts" thing is a nightly ordeal.

So...”"
anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1378288,"“This has to be the best strain I have been fortunate enough to try for sleep.
Smoke this and pain melts away, a half hour after a bowl and goodnight.  Make sure to smoke this only before bed because it will be tough to stay awake once you smoke this strain.  It is amazing and I cannot recommend it high enough.”"
VetsWife,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1356462,"“Wrapped up in blueberry paper , mixed with some Wild Berry Tabacco this is the best I have tried so far.
Smoked it for bad muscle pain due to a messed up cervical spine and it delivered!!
It crept up slowly and left my muscles feeling like jello.
This is certainly going to be a strain I will use permanently to relief pain and muscle tension.”"
cmevans1212,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1245986,"“super potent, effects are intense. I get headaches quite often and every time I blaze some of this my headache goes away almost instantly or in a matter of 5 minutes, I'm never taking excedrin again. Also works perfect if you need to get some sleep, helps me fall asleep fast and wake up feeling good and well rested.”"
dazedandconfused4solong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1612258,"“One bowl will knock you out. It’s an even body high and head high right in your occipital to your crown, which makes me think this activates my hippocampus, which is what a benzodiazepine does, I have ptsd, have had a lot of concussions, depression and anxiety and had a dependency to klonopin( I was on it for a year and a half at a high dose, you are only suppose to be on it for 2 weeks tops) needless to say I had ho...”"
Bloodiebones,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-nurse/reviews/1359677,"“This is my go to for sleep aid and pain. It helps relieve my migraines just enough to its barley there. I have a hard time sleeping and wake up through out the night for no reason but when I take this right before bed I go to sleep quicker and sleep through the whole night. I would recommend for those who have a hard time sleeping and for pain.”"

I use a Boundless CF vaporizer, and my usual routine is to pack the bowl, do a 5-minute session on low, chill for half an hour, do another session on medium, chill again, and repeat usually up to a total of 4 times. I find this gets my AVB dark but not blackened and I get the full benefits.
