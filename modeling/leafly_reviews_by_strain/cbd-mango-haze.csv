CBD Mango Haze
=============
casparproject,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1410311,"‚ÄúThough it's definitely a high quality smoke, I love this flower mostly for making tinctures.  There are three big reasons for this.

1. Total Cannibinoid Percentage:
The flowers I got ahold of were 14% THC and 16% CBD.  This means I can use a whopping 30% of these flowers for medicine in my tinctures.  

2. Flavour:
The light tropical flavour is pleasant, and will not leave you with skunky weed breath (UK Cheese, I'm...‚Äù"

I'd had postpartum depression twice before, and had gone the conventional route of drugs and therapy, etc., but they never worked for me. When growing became legal in my state, I went for it and grew this strain and three others, and never looked back. This was definitely my favorite strain for when I had to get things done (which is, h...‚Äù"
caedef,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1394862,"‚ÄúThis is the best strain for an panic disorder in my opinion! Smells amazing and the high CBD content is ideal for me as THC can actually worsen my anxiety. Highly functional after use due to the high CBD content - a truly medicinal strain - not for the more hardcore smokers that just want to get really baked - just wish the UK would follow suit and legalise it medically (and eventually recreational too.)‚Äù"
eshaylad123,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1375670,"‚ÄúWow...

 A strain with superb medical application (and fun too!) - soothes all anxieties and stress, great pain relief and relaxing. Also provides the uplifting benefits of a slightly energizing sativa (depending on harvest time). You can keep focus and stay on task without getting distracted - good for the productive. As someone who loves to take nice dabs but not waste the day its perfect for me.

Watawkichaw,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1232875,"‚ÄúGreat, smooth high with zero anxiety yet still keeps you awake. Not a heavy high, but awake and chill.‚Äù"
smt39,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1508243,"‚ÄúA rush of full body relaxation while remaining alert and focused? Yes, please. A wonderful strain in effect and taste (vape for full mango notes). Back, neck, and hip pain fade away as a subtle yet potent head high takes charge. A favorite. Try some if it comes around.‚Äù"
seanzy84,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1735586,"‚Äúvery nice cbd strain. buds are very frosty, finger shaped of medium density. smell is piney and citrus with a hint of skunk. good daytime meds for anxiety or depression and also great for relief of physical pain. usually test 1:1 around 10% and 10%, but have seen it go from 1:2 to 2:1 thc cbd. personally like the 1:1 from this strain, nice balanced high that you can smoke all day with out much burn out.‚Äù"
Alaskanflower,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1616986,"‚ÄúI love Mango Haze. Its one of my favorites, for its stress and inflammation.
Mango Haze leaves me feeling happy, relaxed, less anxiety and in less pain.‚Äù"
wackoman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1263694,"‚Äúthis is my current favorite bud. I still consider myself a newbie even though it's been a year of legal here. high cbd on this keeps the thc down and it's not overwhelming. nice energetic sativa high with a little cbd body high makes your pain go away. highly recommended for everyone by me.‚Äù"

barbatos,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1473402,"‚ÄúAwesome strain, be careful for some reason some strains like this tend to set off indoor smoke detectors. Ever want to feel medicated and happy, but smoke flower instead of a dab?‚Äù"
Jackilove,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1763312,"‚ÄúThis is my first time trying the CBD mango haze.. I unfortunately did not have a great experience.. I used to smoke a lot at a younger age until I experienced a bad episode and thus causing me to have major anxiety and panic disorder..

Was looking for a strain high in CBD's to help my spinal arthritis, with muscle relaxation, but not too heavy of a high. This is great for it, and not space brained. Think this will be my daily.‚Äù"
ralexander89,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1430687,"‚ÄúDidn't feel much psychoactive effects but I did feel too zoned/introspective. Think of it as a clean version of being paranoid which is still uncomfortable. Would'nt recommend for social occasions‚Äù"
E-Ross_The_Boss,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1778312,"‚ÄúI love this stuff for when I want to take the edge off my chronic back pain without getting totally barbecued, or when I want to unwind and get loose before jiu jitsu sparring and training.  The ounce I have is closer to the 1:1 ratio, and make no mistake, will still get a person good and medicated if you indulge in a larger amount. My go to if I have stuff to do is half a bowl in my arizer solo 2. The bag appeal on ...‚Äù"
DeadShark77,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1589879,"‚ÄúA had a nice - but stronger than expected high from this. I didn‚Äôt expect to be slightly stoned - but it was good. Stayed focused, no paranoia, energized but not jittery. Was fine watching a few episodes of TV - then I did a load of laundry and some cleaning. Feel great. High was mellow, functional. Peaceful and content now. Muscles feel great!‚Äù"

paul-1955,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1369530,"‚ÄúI have a question to the user community about CBD Mango Haze.  Has anyone grown it from seed?  The profile says it should be 1:1 ratio THC:CBD with an average of 10% each.

I just harvested a crop and after trimming and curing I measured it with a MyDx Cannabis Analyzer, which has been accurate as far as I can tell in the past.  However the measurement I got for the CBD Mango Haze was THC = 20% and CBD = 0.15%.  Whil...‚Äù"

annabeanOG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1704471,"‚ÄúEven for a high CBD low THC strain, I got a moderate buzz from it üò≤ it was pretty unexpected and my fianc√© (who is an occasional toker) loved it. 

Very nice beginning strain and no paranoia or anxiety (:

Very mellow, and something that is nice to smoke when going for a relaxing walk because it very slightly enhances your vision. 

Great pain relief from menstrual cramps and shoulder pain.‚Äù"
StoneyScuba,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1707571,"‚ÄúCurrently dealing with a herniated disc in my lower lumbar, this really helps deal with the pain while keeping a clear head, it's been my go to daytime use for this pain.  I can get a little antsy on some sativas unless I'm out and about, so I don't like to just sit around if I use this, but it's not unbearable if I do.‚Äù"
CaliChris,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cbd-mango-haze/reviews/1784866,"‚ÄúJust tried cbd mango haze in a vape cartridge that is a 3:1 cbd thc ratio. Gives a very nice and chill high. Slightly euphoric. Sightly uplifting. Very comfortable. If I get a chance to try this in flower I will def do that, because in my experience, the flower high is usually better than the oil vape high. I would say Harlequin, which is pretty similar, is a slightly better high. This is still a must try strain imo....‚Äù"

Anyone with ADD or mental depression, should vaporize it before work to improve his/her work life and work experience. This strain and Lilly are my favorite CBD strains yet. Very positive since it excels with providing improved mental stability than a pure Haze. (Vaped with Boundless CFX at 350-370 degrees F)‚Äù"
