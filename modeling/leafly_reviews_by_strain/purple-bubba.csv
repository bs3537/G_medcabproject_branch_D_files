Potent, fun, and intense (not for beginners), fortunately Bubba brings a strong streak of confidence that makes you feel totally badass despite the world blowing up around you. Normally, I’d hesitate recommending heavy/intense strains like this for socializing, but it actually made talking and joking around super fun and easy. Music is utterly transcendent! It’s unbelievably smooth and ...”"
IndicaKid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-bubba/reviews/1378865,"“Thankful I got my hands on this new grow of Bubba. It's a top tier indica body high as expected. It has large frosty leaves that burn slow and smoke very well, leaving a purp/bubba kush/berry taste on the (smooth) exhale.

The high approaches slowly... taking over and leaving your body feeling relaxed and pain free. I don't find it to be too uplifting, however the body buzz (inidica) is a damn good time. Great Strain!”"

The effects of this strain are great, but it left me with an emotional hangover. The next day I felt anxious, insecure and on-edge until the mid-afternoon. This was a powerful dark emotion. 

At first, I didn’t think it had anything to do the herb, but after the 4th bad recovery with this one over the course of 2 months (with ...”"
