Bewilderingly gobbled up ability to think straight but there remains a subtle sharpness that not only adds much needed contrast but really shows how staggeringly consuming the high gradually becomes. Like slow motion ego loss, haha. Vision is a bit muddy and out of focus. Very physical, though - sense of touch is extra stimulating. Music is real nice...captivating. It encompasses you do...”"

I bought something at an Oregon dispensary marketed under the name 'Island,' but was described as essentially the same cross as what is on here so I assume it must be fairly close. You don't need to smoke too much of this to get blasted - my normal 'dose' for MJ of one large hand pipe bowl was enough to put me i...”"
