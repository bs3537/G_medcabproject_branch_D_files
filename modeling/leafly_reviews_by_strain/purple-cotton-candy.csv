You'll feel relaxed from the 1st hit 

Most "weed" accelerates "the gas pedal of your body" but only after 2-3 "hits"

Highly Recommended for MEDICAL Patients 

But don't worry that it won't also wake you up a bit

Bee.buzz420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cotton-candy/reviews/1333396,"“This is a well balanced strain. The effects are a hazed relaxed and euphoric feeling. I cant speak for the potentially great taste this one would have if my particular batch from Livwell on Evans was trimmed, flushed and cured properly. I can say these are solid genetics if you can find a properly grown product.”"

So this hybrid is insanely good, but in a chill, happy, goofy, creative way for me. Definitely evening. relaxing, or as others have said a great help with sleep in larger doses.
