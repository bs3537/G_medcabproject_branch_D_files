Cookies Kush
=============
John18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1395979,"“Bless me Father, for I have sinned.  I purchased a 1/2 oz. of Cookies Kush, however my dispensary call it, Golden Cookies, but no matter the regional nomenclature, this batch of Cookies SC Lab tested in at 30.28% THC.
That's a cookie, baby, that one must taste, for it is so sweet, that it is easy to want that next puff.  But wait, I say wait!  Savor one good bong load, or one good puff off a nice joint or pipe load a...”"
Exmo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1416126,"“This was some pretty strong stuff. A few puffs from my vaporizer and I was glued to the couch, virtually unable to budge for hours. After about two hours, it completely knocked me out and I woke up as the movie I had just started was ending. For as strong as the high was, it didn't mess with my brain too much and I was mostly just relaxed as I tried to watch movies with my wife.

There are two reasons that I don't gi...”"
mattdaganjamasta,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1382844,"“I can't tell you this is a strong weed, cause that is an understatement. It had me nearly unable to carry on a conversation and/or move for about 4 hours. so yeah....”"
Robertjennings,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1396037,"“Tried this strain at Barney's Coffeeshop in Amsterdam and real talk, it was quit a treat. Cookies Cush resembles aromas found in Girl Scout Cookies. Although listed as an indica the effects touch close to a sativa dominate strain. Truly one of the better strains I tried.”"
squeeb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1387964,"“Beautiful, delish, potent Indica. GrandDaddy Purple still takes the cake as my fave indica but Cookies Kush is a close second. Relaxing,  mellow, zero anxiety, some creativeness, top 10 faves.”"
savannah27,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1382846,"“I've been smoking on some cookies kush for a little over a month now and it's the perfect strain to smoke before bed 😍 I've been smoking for awhile, but take like 4 bong rips of this and it knocks me on my ass. Really, really, really strong indica hybrid, it's an amazing physical & head high. Great strain to smoke socially, everyone gets super baked super quick. 5/5 stars, will be picking up again!❤️”"
inditiva0,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1387966,"“Note: Review for OG Cookies. Very relaxing body high followed by gradually intensifying cerebral effects. Great for pain management or just lounging around after a hard day's work. Sweet and pungent taste and aroma only lasts the first few hits.”"
UncleAcid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1380328,"“Being born and raised in California, I have a big ol' soft spot for OG Kush. And who doesn't like Cookie strains?? So I had high hopes for this particular strain, as I lovvvvve Indicas especially, and I gotta say, it surpassed my wildest dreams!

Just a single big fat (1.4g) doobie rolled with a king size Juicy Jay Mango flavored rolling paper, and I fell head over heels for this stuff! 

Genuinely impressed by this ...”"
Draeden,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1382848,"“Not what I expected from a cross between GSC and OGK. It is a very nice strain. But when I think GSC or OGK, I think happy, giggly, uplifting, etc. This is very heavy in the face. It certainly has the calming effects. 

Maybe since I experienced this in a dab it was a bit heavy.  It's worth a try. Plenty of worse strains out there.”"
SupaSmoka,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1382847,"“A sweet tasty strain for those who don't like too sacrifice potency for flavour this is you all over. It's sweet but retains that Kush element which gives a strong taste with strong effects. A good evening smoke if suffering from insomnia etc.”"
VapeQueen710,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1612302,"“Method: Barney's Flower in a Vaporizer

Aroma: It smells, sweet with a bit of spice and fruit. 1/1 Star.
Taste: The sweet takes over at first with a marshmellow-y pastry taste before ending with some berry hints. I think this would be amazing as a vape cartridge to really pull out the right terpenes. 1.5/2 Stars.
Feel: A strong and classic indica. Had to cancel a walking tour I had later that night and just sit on a ...”"
BaronOfBud,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1382845,"“Didn't realize I had the illustrious Cookies Kush till I was packing a bowl and realized the bud tender wrote "Kush Cookies" a simple misspell. A real treat, extremely hard to find, great for night night sleepy time.”"

I really like this strain. For the personal stuff, I like that it is an evening relaxing strain, but without knocking me to the floor or couch. I did a few more things before calling it a night. I just felt cozy and relaxed, and slept very well the whole night. Properly cured, she smells and tastes grea...”"
KushyCookies,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1328211,"“First strain I smoked in Amsterdam when I visited there with my ex. Being a great fan of the infamous Girl Scout Cookies, I just had to try out this one. And boy... it hit me hard. Never was that high after just one spliff. Very psychedelic, funky and relaxing. Will definitely buy this again when I visit the Dam this year in order to find out if it's still that good haha”"
xanderjd,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1307189,"“Not a beginner strain or a strain for someone who doesn't smoke often.

I smoked a pre-rolled blunt  at Barney's Farm in Amsterdam.

The high started off as mellow but slowly escalated to the point where my heart was racing and I was sweating uncontrollably.  Took roughly two hours before I came down, but I slept like a baby on my 10 hour flight.”"

Sammi_S,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1582295,"“Definitely a strain that kicks insomnia and depression in the butt! Cookies Kush is a smoke that allows you to sink into deep relaxation and sleep. Smoke a little bit less and just lay on your couch and be ridiculously happy! While Cookies Kush is one of the weaker strains I tried, it is one that I loved so much I hope to grow one day. Cookies Kush has allowed me to stop taking my sleeping medicine, and has helped to...”"
WhiteJoints,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1373705,"“I just finished growing this plant it was extremely tall and loved an acidic feeding ph. was around 5.4 to 5.8 over all very good smoke with chucky buds. Next time I'll definitely top this plant.”"
almosteasy1222,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1270847,"“Pretty good shit. Hits nice and smoothly, and has a very sweet smell to it. When smoking, one can really smell the sweetness (think savory, like sausages). Smoked a joint of this stuff and I'm experiencing a nice relaxed stone. Feeling a little spacey, kinda giggly, very hungry. If you want to just chill out for six hours and rediscover the wonders of tasty food, Cookies Kush is a real treat.”"
Vonquiqui,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1253459,"“Really strong and earthy and gives off a lot of kief. The only thing is that it makes you EXTREMELY hungry”"
alben,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1616962,"“Very nice strain with one of the happiest highs I’ve ever been on. Spent my time playing games and browsing the web and everything was amazing. Definitely a nighttime strain though, it’ll make you want to sleep. Only reason it isnt five stars is because it did take me a fair bit to get more than a slight buzz.”"
SiriusSativa,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1349796,"“When you cross breed two amazing strains your bound to create something magical.  Immediately after the first toke, you go into full meltdown. With a pungent aroma but a sweet after taste, your left to gaze at the clouds.”"
SolanumDulcamara,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookies-kush/reviews/1513322,"“Deliciously stoned and a little trippy too. I'm a great lover of The Couchlock and always looking for something that'll glue me down. One of my favorites has been Afghan Kush, but that one is a bit more gloomy emotionally. Cookies Kush is a sweet, serene and joyous high with a serious couchlock and pretty tripping in the first moments it hits you. I am in love.”"
