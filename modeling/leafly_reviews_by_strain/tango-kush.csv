slothBOP,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tango-kush/reviews/1412723,"“I just took a couple bong rips for a wake and bake and this strain gives you a overall good uplifting sativa and relaxing body stone. This strain smells very fruity like sweet mangos with hints of earth and pine if you can smell past the fruitiness. Good strain if your looking for something strong with a good flavor”"
