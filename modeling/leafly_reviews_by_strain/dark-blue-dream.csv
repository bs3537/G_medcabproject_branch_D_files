rachelrife,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1330668,"“I love it! its just the perfect strain for me, so I know that everyone's different I experienced a smooth calm body high with a relaxing aftermath, it took a minute to kick in but once it did I was on cloud 9!”"
CO26,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1326318,"“Tasty bud but turns me into a total giggle monster. Hard to stay focused or be productie with this strain but super fun for hanging out with friends for a chill night. Not a day time strain for me.”"
PlatinumFang,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1380223,"“Easily one of my favorite strains, makes me so happy, and the euphoria is so good. I started laughing at nothing a couple of times and it eliminates depression and anxiety better than my prescription meds. I love it”"
molex333,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1616506,"“Very nice relaxing high. I got this strain via a Terrapin vape cartridge (ICan-Hybrid). It was a CO2 so the flavor was understated, but the effectiveness was top notch. The cart is well made and the vapes are consistent. Made me feel energetic but not too jumpy.”"
C.jackson2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1793581,"“Great daytime Sativa hybrid. Awesome size buds from Terrapin in Pennsylvania. The 1/8th that I got had one bud that weighed in at 3.1 grams.”"

NaturesWayMedicine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1688731,"“The flavor of Dark Blue Dream is distinct and enjoyable with a strong fruity sweet berry taste that patients really enjoy. DBD is good for day and evening time use and patients say it uplifts your mood, relieves stress, depression, and helps with insomnia. You can find this flower now in Philadelphia despensaries.”"
CryptoCraig,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1720258,"“One of my new favorite strains...it's classic Blue Dream with some kick. I recommend it to everyone I know. Give it a go.”"
Honeybee16,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1651199,"“This strain in a distillate has helped my joint pain, spasms and migraines. Plus it puts me in a great mood. Definitely recommend”"
friendlyfire0125,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1657822,"“Picked up an 1/8 of this strain from Blooming Deals in Beaverton, OR and IT. WAS. BOMB. The flower I got was cultivated by Terrapin Care Station and let me just say, THEY KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY’RE DOING! This absolutely melted my mind and body into straight bliss and relaxation. It alleviated any body pains and migraines I was having and made me feel super happy/relaxed/giggly. New favorite strain for sure!”"
clumatikush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1356055,"“Great for after work keeps you up through supper and up until bedtime and a great night sleep. Helped pain a lot.”"
elsyd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1381103,"“Love this strain, have it in rosin and co2 oil excellent flavors, some nice euphoria as well a eyes get heavy similar to a nice heavy indica, but unlike indicas it retains much of the blue dream qualities, not a buzzy high, hate those personally, just nice hybrid high, great blueberry undertones, would recommend to most smokers, does have some slight anxiety”"
GreenSelene,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1671703,"“This is amazing! All the best from Blue Dream intensified by the Dark Knight. Definitely an after work strain, but it doesn't put you to sleep either. Full body relaxation, with a good headiness. Wish I would've gotten more when I could! Loving everything from Terrapin.”"
EmeraldLady,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1779599,"“Wow......isolate/pain excellent!”"
ctemp222,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1336195,"“This is a great day and night strain, however I prefer it for daytime use. I have gotten paranoid before when using it. I get sleepy only after heavy use. The nug is dark green with many orange/ brown hairs. This strain is top quality stuff the only reason I took one star off is because of the slight paranoia.”"
rmxxps,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1767747,"“This is a strain that puts to straight to the sky. The high lasted a good 2.5 hours and the entire time was intense. 

This is definitely a daytime strain. I'd say it's more "sativa-like". Energetic but not focused. This is a strain for a good night where sleep is not the goal. 

The flavor profile is a bit odd to me, kind of a subdued flavor of a fruit salad, blueberry notes and an earthy finish. 

If you enjoy very...”"

SusanMurin18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1710424,"“I definitely taste the blueberry and a sweetness. Its a great hybrid . It seems to be more Sativa dominant. Great for pain relief, depression and anxiety.”"
MyJokerHandStayLIT,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1745130,"“Dark Blue Dream - wow am I really excited I thoroughly loved the Happie orange gorilla in coming through with another amazing strain here we go. Besides concentrates these pods are easily the best and my favorite cannabis products that I’ve ever used. So let’s take a journey down a dark blue dream together.

riff610,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1679544,"“Scent wise this smells rather earthy, possibly hydro flat scent not very sharp in the jar to the nose.  a shitty trim job, the way it grinds makes me think that this was a bit rushed on the curing and trimming end in order to get it out in the public.  The taste of this to me is earthy/chlorophyll type taste with a bit of the orange rind one would expect from a nice blue dream.  I do enjoy it.

effect wise it seems r...”"

elsyd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1379238,"“Absolutely love this strain, get it from the Terrapin Care Station in rosin form, they grow it there, and I must say the description on Leafly is slightly wrong while sedating, or could just be the cut I get, seems to be more of a sativa dominate strain with blankets of euphoria, but it gives you the drive to get up and roll this is a very fine medicinal strain or for users looking for a tasty sativa!”"
earlofamerica,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1440425,"“This is the perfect chill with friends or just plain chill weed. I'm writing this after just having smoked about half a joint of this 30 minutes ago. It has very nice cerebral effects but they feel calm and somewhat natural. The physical effects hit you about 10-15 minutes later. More than sedating, like Platinum Bubba Kush, they're just plain relaxing. It's nice easy physical high that still leaves you feeling like ...”"
Monkezcry,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1757213,"“Love this stain. A little more head high then I'm used to
 from sativa. After first try I learn this a bud to use in moderation. Love the flavor, a tasty smoke.”"
Johawk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1468464,"“Great strain, not as good as the original Blue Dream high wise, but amazing flavor. For me the high wore off pretty quick but its a great smoke!”"
Dreed03,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1747217,"“One of the best stains yet, blue dream is good but’ this is great for no pain and incredible focus, one of the top 10 in my book.”"

LotusKai,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1388855,"“I found this strain to be quite enjoyable as someone who doesn't normally like Blue Dream. The Dark Night adds a much needed body high to the Blue Dream and IMO seems to enhance the mellow cerebral high from the Blue Dream. It is truly a 50/50 hybrid, not being too strong on either side but having both a noticeable and relaxing head and body high. The taste was amazing as well.”"
eymacassi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1378067,"“This one was recommended to me by my budtender. The smell is sweet, earthy, and mild. The buds are HUGE. Really nice, sweet smoke. Smooth. The high was surprisingly clear headed. I had to smoke a whole bowl before noticing anything, really. I was happy, grateful, and dreamy. This was just an all around balanced smoke, ending with me snug in bed 💗”"
chompy709,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1606476,"“wonderful scent and texture. that actual taste is rather harsh which is unfortunate. the actual high you receive isn't the best either. It almost gave me a headache type high.”"
CaptainQuazar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dark-blue-dream/reviews/1724825,"“My Dark Blue Dream from Terrapin smelled and tasted like a blueberry bog in a good way. Small, fuzzy, and sticky buds yielded a nice grind which produced a dense vapor. I almost immediately felt a floaty, relaxed body & brain high, which was most pleasant. Did not pair well with Fear: The Walking Dead, but this is no fault of Dkb.”"

I am a sativa guy who uses sativa/sativa high cbd. I was leery at first bc indicas don't sit well with me even though this is a sativa leaning hybrid. 

Blown away by the energetic clear headed effects yet great body feel. mild stone feeling. very gentle yet effective. sativa lovers will enjoy the clear headed e...”"
