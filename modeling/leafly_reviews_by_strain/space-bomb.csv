wizeguy502,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-bomb/reviews/1368533,"“Bottom Line Up Front: 
 I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great sativa based hybrid.  This is a great late evening weekend / funtimes strain.  Onset is a quick and you will soon find yourself engaged, euphoric, and arroused.  potent high with lasting effects makes this great for small intimate get togethers or to smoke with your main squeeze.  Great for pain and depression.

AngelWolf666,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-bomb/reviews/1395467,"“Strong spicy, citrusy, cheese scented bud. Earthy flavor when smoked, flavor not very strong. Tiny buds in the gram I have (a little smaller than miniature marshmallows). Good for small bowls.

Smoke isn't too harsh, although it does leave a alight tickle in the back of one's throat. The high doesn't hit right away; sort of creeps up on you like Space Jill does, and it does wrap around your melon the same way.

aulondon15,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-bomb/reviews/1395468,"“My new fave strain. Worked quickly. It helped me focus for studying. Got rid of the headache I'd get from trying to wrap my head around certain concepts as well as gave me the creative insight to understand why things happened.”"

amyflack,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-bomb/reviews/1348945,"“This is a tasty strain I smoked before taking a long walk at the beach. Oddly enough, I couldn't stop thinking about math equations until it wore off. This could be in part to my obsession with multiple regression and structural equation modeling at present. Finishing a dissertation, so maybe that has something to do with it. But, nonetheless, it is a really contemplative strain and one that made thinking about mathe...”"

Tastes rather earthy on the exhale, the high quickly grows on you and its like your mind spins on two ends. Gets you really contemplative in a speedy sort of way, gives you a lot of new insights on anything ranging from a TV show to a philosophical conversation. Best smoked through a pipe for this one, the bubbler we got seemed to kill mos...”"

mgnetto,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-bomb/reviews/1576105,"“This strain is hands down the best I've had. I have enormous bouts of anxiety and this seems to be the only strain that shuts it down. And depending on my mood I'll get a different experience whether that means needing a drifting through a couch lock or putting on music, making dinner - those things that anxiety distracts me from - fun! Can't wait for the next batch to come through my area.”"

BadgerBhoy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-bomb/reviews/1156332,"“Acquired medically from Planet Joe at the NW Cannabis Market. Space Bomb has an incredibly complex flavor and aroma, like few others. Sweet, and earthy notes of pine, sage, a sweet floral flavor I can't quite describe specifically. The many layered flavor is definitely to be savored. The effect comes on gently, but definite. Living up to its name and parentage, your head is lifted to a floaty, ebbing and flowing peac...”"

KushCommander,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-bomb/reviews/1185728,"“Deff smoke this how ever you want. Smell is sweet wood rot with a kind of pungent gas. Also the smells-taste, is like a fresh stack of money. Insane looking trichs! Smoke is pleasant, deff tap it before you get a cotton mouth ass hit.  The feeling is like having a tiny black hole in the middle of your brain. Not a fast acting, tasty, chronic smoking flower. Maybe better as crumble or in treats.”"

I would recommend it for sativa enthusiasts and people that like good tasting bud 8/10.”"

They were not lying. From the first hit, which was very smooth, the sativa hit first and gave me a very euphoric feeling. Then the colors start getting more vivid as my mind spins, thinking all these new creative thoughts. After a couple more hits I can feel the indica start working, helping...”"

Prairie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-bomb/reviews/1289080,"“One of my favorite strains, equal to the electrifying sativa Durban Poison for euphoric and energizing effects, but without any of the anxiety edge that can come along with DP.  For my money, Space Bob is infinitely superior to its legendary parent, Space Queen.  Even though it's only a 60% Sativa hybrid, the effects of Space Bomb feel primarily like Sativa.”"
kjchoya,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-bomb/reviews/1474081,"“This strain brought me from a very "down" frame of mind to a relaxed, enjoy-the-day mindset in minutes. Excellent euphoric and happy effects. Raw buds are nicely marbled with orange, and the aroma is like fresh hay mixed with lemon verbena. Flavor is just a touch sweet, and is not overpowering. 

I used this for depression, and it brought me relief.”"

RBMarshall,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-bomb/reviews/1069997,"“SpaceBomb did its job as a sativa; woke me up, kept me focused... but it was very seedy, unfortunately I spent more time picking out the seeds than enjoying my high. The flavor is very earthy, the flavor to me did not match its scent.

It was on sale as a 20$ 8th and now I know why. I wouldn't waste your time with this strain unless its a decent price.”"
KDawn1108,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-bomb/reviews/1532721,"“I was NOT impressed with this strain. My Bud Tender told me it was "like a middle road or equal between Sativia & Indica". 

I got NO relief of pain & minimal effect on anxiety or PTSD sxs. It may be so "equal" that it does nothing effectively. It was like I wasn't taking anything for my sxs at all. 

I will not EVER buy this again & do NOT recommend it for any medicinal purposes.”"
