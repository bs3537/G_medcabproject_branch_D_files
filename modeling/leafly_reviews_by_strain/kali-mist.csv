Kali Mist
=============
ThaPurplePrince,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1412108,"“The Mist I picked up had to be the most trichome packed buds so far this year. Mostly bright green but one of the smaller nugs had a very dark tint, almost purple. The high had me uplifted from the start but the further I dove into the bowl the more energetic and adventurous I got. Also the high made me very talkative throughout the rest of the night. Me and my friend even went down to a spot by the Mississippi river...”"

It worked great for all. It did (as other reviews have said here and elsewhere) give me a burst of much needed energy & also helped my thoughts&conscious to become clearer(a miracle effect since I have ADHD also) smoke was light & citrusy tasting with a touch of woodsy notes. ...”"
BigSmokeyOG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1411979,"“Wow this stuff is the premo top shelf quality. I went from normal to having a big cheesy grin all over my face. Euphoric lift off like no other strain I've tried. Clear, energetic. No red eyes or couchlock. I'd highly recommend for anxiety and depression in particular. If I could only have one strain for the rest of my life this is it. A must try for any smoker. I'd rate this my first and only 10/10.”"
Binkyfarms,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1396909,"“I am really impressed with the "Kali Mist." This was my first time trying it and it surpassed all the hype. I picked up a joint from a club in San Jose and got down to business. I smoked it and felt like a million bucks. It had that TRUE Sativa effect. The high was smooth and very uplifting. It's great for daytime sessions or after a stressful day at work. And yes, I will be adding it to the rotation list. The list i...”"
dkshmily,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1411980,"“This shits amazing. Seriously. It puts me in a good mood and I suffer from depression. It energizes me too. I had a bowl to myself and cleaned my entire house. Twice. I recommend this to everyone who needs to relax.”"
London_1985,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1382243,"“Smoked this on the off chance in Amsterdam had never heard of it before and just by its name and appearance it drew me in.

Glad it did, i smoked a whole joint with a Mint Tea overlooking the water by central station. I first felt it in my face, but instead of the pressure behind the eyes i got a warm glowing sensation under my eyes on top of my cheeks.

Next as it spread over my body i became extremely euphoric ...”"
puppetmastahxd,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1382242,"“This is a great strain. I have chronic depression and anxiety and I tried this out. Right now, I am very uplifted and have a boost of energy to do the things I want to do without worry and it makes me relaxed at the same time. The experience has been VERY psychedelic to me, just yesterday, I was able to perceive my friend in a different perspective, (I saw him as a completely different person, visually). Kaleidoscope...”"

Possibly the most medicinal strain i have ever had the joy to use. Very functional and focused enabling me to function with the public in the huge busy city centre without loosing my cool and bailing on the mission. If you keep topping up too soon without letting the cannabinoids in your sy...”"
vangink,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1367087,"“Open up the jar and it seems you get sprayed with a tropical mist. Typical sativa look: tight cone nugs, chewbacca hairy, brown sugar coated. Tastes like a dream, mix of Jack Herer and Hawaiian Haze, if I had to put my finger on it. High doesn't last very long at all, unfortunately, but that's okay, I don't mind packing another vape bowl. Fantastic for hanging out, working out, swimming, anything interactive!  Do not...”"
enlightenment,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1411981,"“I could not give this a higher )lol( rating. It is a really, really, mellow but powerful Sativa. I would put this at the top of my list for Sativa being: 

1) Kali Mist
2) Durban Poison
3) Sour Diesel”"
Strawberrydust,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1076076,"“When smoked from bong one can clearly see why this unique strain has its name. These flowers provided one of the greatest feelings I've had in my few years of smoking. One bowl will take you to heaven if hit the right way. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Got it at a local recreational shop.”"
Pav92,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1154666,"“Incredibly energetic, excellent for getting tasks done throughout the day. Clear headed high with mental clarity. Little bout of happiness, nothing much more to the high. Energy and clarity are the key aspects of the high. Taste is lovely. Fairly buttery taste to start, which turns into more sweet and citrus flavours along with strong earthy notes on the exhale. Great smoke would definitely buy again.”"
djdaveathome,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1343396,"“This, so far, is my all time favorite sativa. 
Originally grown myself from mail order seeds in a grow closet in the late 90's. 
Couldn't believe the flavours, aromas and the high!
The aroma put out by slightly crushing the bud was anise, sage and something like cedar with a dash of black pepper once and a while.
Smoke was also spicy and earthy 
The high was uplifting and energizing while also being almost psychedeli...”"

KingCUTA,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1241016,"“This strain seemed harsh to the throat and hard to take large hits. The effects were very clear headed and energetic, but when it wares off it resulted in exhaustion and the feeling of being "fried". Not my favorite strain.”"

epaque,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1076074,"“Ok.  Kali Mist is my favourite sativa strain thus far.  Tasty little sugar-coated nugs with rusty brown hair.  The smell is strong, flavour smooth.  After three good rips put the water pipe down and enjoy the effects.  Soon afterward, you will want to do something active and be social.  Agree with other reviewers that this is not the nighttime herb.”"

pliable,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1343399,"“Quite possibly my favorite strain of all time. I had this about a decade ago and still have fond memories of it. The description says it can verge on psychedelic at times, which is absolutely correct. I had a delicious burrito while high on this, and with each bite, I'd close my eyes and see bursts of color. Absolutely magical strain, and I haven't had it since, and I really miss it :(”"
Jeekayjay,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kali-mist/reviews/1331105,"“The nugs are more spindly looking with collections of smaller buds surrounding the stalk.  A nice medium green with an abundance of orange hairs.

Interestingly enough I find it difficult to get a scent from this plant.  Even on fresh grind I could only detect a faint peppery smell.  Definitely unique.  Busts out average.

Commencing vaporization of .2...

Decent vapor with kind of and earthy sweet flavour on exhale....”"

Indeed a good sativa, however, it makes me feel anxious, and it has a not so pleasant smell. The negatives outweigh the positives, but I bought this, more or less, not fully cured. I am curing this myself, and it has been roughly a week. Even within a week, I'm starting to notice a better smell.

I was curious to try it towards bedtime to see if it had any of the effects like like (arousal, colors, patterns, imagination enhancement) but it seemed to not do any of those for me.
