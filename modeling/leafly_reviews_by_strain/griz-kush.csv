The.Avid.Dabber,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1410230,"“I love this strain almost as much as I love the future-funk man GRiZ himself. Now I just need a dispensary in Seattle to source it!”"
bc7110,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1327595,"“I had this as a Platinum Vape Oil which is the second tier of highness to me, with flower being first, and jelly, wax shatter the third level.  The Griz Kush gave me strong force field euphoria to start, also made me hungry a bit.  I was scatterbrained but focused on what I was doing, felt very relaxed too.  Excellent chronic pain relief and put me down for the count for a bit at the end.”"

Sublime2CT,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1430532,"“Great wake and bake strain before work or during the day! Total balance between sativa energy and head high to the relaxing effects of a good Indica. Its a must try for sure.”"
iamtheory,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1439060,"“If you love to get really high and have that high last a really long time then this strain is for you. I was incredibly shocked when I first smoked this strain, I was already smoking a bowl of Or mixed with some Sour Kush. But then I switched pipes (already had this strain packed) and bam! I was instantly super high and it lasted a really long time. Just two hits and you are higher than normal, I just love how powerf...”"

JustJacks,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1414635,"“Extreme giggles. Zero anxiety. This is some fun weed when you're doing a mindless outdoor activity- lots of energy, but sloppy, silly high so not for sports. Some of the buds I got are a dark purple that's almost black. I don't like how varied the buds are in one batch. It's almost two strains in one eighth- the greener buds are much better.”"
TrapQueen666,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1226580,"“This is amazing. Tastes amazing, smells amazing. Makes me feel great! But it gets me Beyond high!”"
Luk45,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1720039,"“Had the Griz Shatter Bone. Comes on fast and strong. Their Kush already is a hybrid of sativa/indica, so shatter takes it up several notches. Budmeister says it is around 29% THC. I only had a few drags but will do more next session.

Oh, and opened my airways and sinuses better than steroid inhalers!”"

just don't dig the taste”"
CO26,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1383072,"“This strain just puts me straight to sleep. Total couch lock, then out cold. Not a great daytime smoke, great for difficulting falling asleep.”"
scottharmony,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1211296,"“Good sativa with heavy indica characteristics as well.  Can be too strong for those not used to the strong combo of both Tang Haze and Chrital Pakistani.  Very stoney! So it may not be a functioning smoke for you.  Not the  most euphoric I've had, but definitely a pleasantly strong "headband-like" feeling around the head.  My batch I couldn't taste any Tang I imagine due to the ash being black, because the pot was no...”"

yaaasQueen88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1358796,"“My ABSOLUTE favorite strain. First case I take my patients to every time, and you will never catch me without a lil Griz in my pocket ;)

My home is perfumed with the Griz, as the bowl on my coffee table always runneth over. Griz in the morning, Griz in the afternoon, Griz for supper time, Griz for the bedroom. All day, every day.

jameranese,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1355925,"“this stain had me very alert and focused I experienced a head high plus a relaxed body feel. if I'm laying down im super focused on relaxing but if I need to do something the focused switched very really for me. I'd definitely recommend this stain #420sweepstakes”"
CO26,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1383071,"“Middle of the road strain. Taste is palatable, primarily citrusy with some piney/earthy tones. Happy and giggly high. Effects are primarily cerebral.”"
weastcoast69,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1411836,"“It's a very active hybrid; I smoked it thinking I would watch TV but instead rearranged my entire closet. You might want to use it on a hike or a beach day, because it's happy and makes colors look cool, if you know what I mean. Psychedelic in that sense, like many kush strains, right? I'm new to the game. Also got that crazy headband feeling, so that's fun.”"

Koopday,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1599513,"“4.5! I struck gold with my strain selections this weekend and Griz Kush is indeed one of them.  How nice! Rare find bc it's only at NRoots and I was near one so I went ahead to finally try it.  Truly a very nice strain! THC level is mid/upper teens but don't let that fool you; this is a nic,e relaxing and creative/motivation strain.
Happy, happy, happy!  Is a good description. Not couch lock but not energetic or racy...”"

SlowNorman2008,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/griz-kush/reviews/1370447,"“This is a great strain. definitely euphoric, but clear headed enough to get stuff done. It kind of creeped up on me and before you knew it, I was feeling great! would definitely recommend this strain.”"
