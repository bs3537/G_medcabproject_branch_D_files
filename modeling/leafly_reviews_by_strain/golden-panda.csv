GreenLife,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-panda/reviews/1378449,"“This is one of my favorites, we did a sweet review while smoking this strain. it was definetly a deep crystal heavy hitter that had us lifted as a team, the creative ideas where flowing and we had pretty good energy. I think we hit up 3-4 locations for the sohot that night. Check out the review at marijuanaTV.org

Gladshire,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-panda/reviews/1287514,"“I bought a half ounce of this stuff recently. It's a change from the usual Blue Dream or Skywalker, but a good change. Strong mind high with minimal tiredness and laziness often
associated with the Indica side of hybrids. I would definitely recommend it.”"
GreenLife,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-panda/reviews/1343894,"“Golden Panda is an excellent strain that offers me a creative social high followed by some of the most epic munchies iv ever experienced. With smooth buttery undertones hints of pine and bright green sugar covered buds this is definitively a unique strain that offers allot of stress relief.

Currently dealing with my monthly curse so I needed something to take the edge off of these cramps & help ward off my fatigue. I had a pre-roll (3 hits). This high is light but my body feels light, not stuck in the couch. But I feel nice.”"

This strain was on sale so I thought I would try it, and it was a really good choice. It helped my body relax, relieved my anxiety/depression, and definitely got me stoned and it let's you watch netflix all night but still have the energy to get up and cook dinner for the on coming munchies. 

(PS. I wrote this stoned)”"

Sorry... i just smoked a bowl & feeling it (a creeper).  This makes the mind go to fun places!

Its great it really reduces anxiety significantly helps with pain a nice amount, I use it throughout the day without any problems with munchies. Be careful it's strong however, might be sitting down initially after the the beginning then something kicks in after 30 mins or so and you want to do things. All while having a nice happy pleasant time. Migraine relie...”"
