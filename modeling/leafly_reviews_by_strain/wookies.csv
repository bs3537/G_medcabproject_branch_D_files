Dgran,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1395592,"“This strain is awesome. A buddy of mine gifted me a few babies out of what he had and I was able to grow a few last year. It was an organic grow and I ended up with an average yield, but the smoke was great and after a week long cure was very, very smooth. It has an earthy, woody aroma and great flavor. Nice mellow (as in mood, not intensity) high. If I get it again I will probably keep a mother for personal and to s...”"
Blitzking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1467033,"“Your body feels stony and relaxed while your head is lifted into the land of smiles. Such a happy, fun, chill high. It's like reggae music in the summer. I may have to go back for more.”"
TCDittmer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1481758,"“For me this was THE strain.  No side effects for me and great relief from stress.  I have an anxiety issue and their was NO anxiety or paranoia.  I know it may not be that way for everyone but dang this leaves me happy and smiling.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1588921,"“I'm a dabber the only way I'll smoke flower is if it's a free preroll. Surprisingly Wookies got me pretty toasted for a prerolls.
Helped time pass on my long bus ride back home after picking up my medicine in Phoenix 
Great for being social even if you normally have too much anxiety.
A solid 4 star strain.”"

hyperconsumer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1387168,"“Beautifully relaxing high but still able to be sociable. Powerful indica type high but not overpowering so you can't function. Tasted incredible too! Minty fresh.”"
BarnesM,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1550305,"“Wow!! Thee!! Prettiest bud 💨 ive ever seen not only that smokes amazingly smooth and smells like a cookie factory,the high seems to linger around much longer after consumption....😧😧 top notch fire ✊”"
Supreme99th,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1453542,"“Awesome smell: earthy & a bit piney with a menthol undertone. Very dense nuggets; opened one up and discovered a mine of shiny, sticky trichomes. Physical characteristics of Girl Scout Cookies (but with considerably different effects), and the frostiness of White 91 combine and birth Wookies, a smooth, pleasant flower mostly suitable for evenings (or really any other time than morning/afternoon). This one is worth tr...”"

sativaismydog,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1616266,"“I bought this in the shatter and made a vape pen out of it. It’s such a nice high! I have anxiety and get stoned quick. This got me feelin’ giggly and happy and surprisingly super creative. I personally wouldn’t feel comfortable going out or working after taking my pen hit only because it was so obvious with my smile and eyes that I was high. But for me, again someone with anxiety, I was super happy and felt creative...”"
Dread80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1501029,"“Definitely a heavy hitter! 
After 2 bong hits [2 ft.] and 7 mins later, I was truely in lala land.  However, after about 40 minuets, Turned energetic, with a sativa feel.

Not for beginners, and also a creeper.

5 Stars for potency alone, and easy on the throat.”"

13Murphy74,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1736014,"“Got super excited about a regular bud. seen this brand new screen at the dispensary @$60 an 8th. Thought to myself "hell yeah" don't get me wrong it's a decent Indica leaning hybrid but it definitely was not worth $60. It got me high, took my pain away but there's definitely nothing exceptionable except the the look, this has beautiful hues and huge fence buds.”"
Indigoflo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1571215,"“Excellent and uplifting! It's even easy to engage with my professor or other students during lecture! It most definitely allows focused attn and concentration during studies :) (senior@UT; major of Urban Studies, minor of Architecture). Tricky to find the best strain during semesters, so this is definitely, for me at least, like the perfect green tea ^_^”"

theORherb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wookies/reviews/1535852,"“Kind of a letdown, honestly. It has a very strong skunky smell, with a bit of menthol. It came in a lot of mid-size dense nugs, they're different shades of green with brown trichomes all around. It made me cough a bit, but it was pretty smooth. It gave me a nice head buzz. But honestly,  it being labeled 28.60% THC and descending from Girl Scout Cookie, I was hoping for something better. Plus I just wasn't digging th...”"

I purchased this strain after reading Leafly's description that gave it medical high marks as a treatment for insomnia.  Do not buy Wookies as an insomnia treatment,  as there are much better strains for this purpose.  This is a better strain for afternoon or early evening use.  I docked it one star, not because it is a bad strain, b...”"
