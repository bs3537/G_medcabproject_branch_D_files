But with parents like train wreck & Oregon diesel (I think) it's no surprise this combo packs an energetic punch. Perfect for starting your day or for starting a project. I never have energy, my health isn't doing so well. Thank god for sativas.

out of this world for social anxiety and shyness. I get very chatty with this strain. Love it, def worth a try.”"

Taste was a bit earthy with a great sweet/nutty aftertaste. The aftertaste tasted a bit like sweet roasted almonds to me.
