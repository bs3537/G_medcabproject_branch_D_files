Bubba's Gift
=============
Purple_Baphomet,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1385948,"“This wonderful creation of Bubba Kush crossed with God's Gift (I got it from Phat Panda farms, don't know if they created it or not) produces one of the best and most diverse smell, flavor, and effect profile I've experienced in a LONG time. It's thoroughly indica and has an ineffable combination of sweet, fruity, earthy, purple/grape-like, flowerly smells that carry over almost entirely into the taste -- the effects...”"
emilysbluedream,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1387297,"“I am a smoker of purely indica these days, medicating PTSD & anxiety. This strain helped me fall asleep comfortably. Definitely euphoric, with no paranoia. Grounding & creative energies. I've read this is a daytime indica but I found it to make me a little too sleepy for the wake & bake. Pretty flowers. ♡”"
mrobadamus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1354614,"“Purchased from Greenside Rec by Phat Panda
Flower: No doubt this is one of the most beautiful flowers you will ever see. Purple indica buds with evergreen leaves and vibrant orange hairs. Everything is covered in a healthy dusting of frost. I shit you not I stared at this bud for a good ten minutes under the magnifying glass in absolute awe. 
Smell: Skunky grape pungent and earthy
Crumble: grinds into a purple fluff...”"
lovebud1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1335853,"“Fruity with a lovely frosted dark purple color. Relaxed, but not mush. Elevated, but comfortable. Not speedy or hyper. Worries will melt away. Indica profile, but not in a bad way. I think I could get a lot done at work with this. I'm more focused and interested in things. Really good stuff.”"
SkullyOrganics,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1387296,"“Giving this one 5 stars for some specific reasons. First being that I smoked half a joint of this stuff and had absolutely ZERO anxious/paranoid feelings whatsoever. If you're an anxiety sufferer and some of the heavier heady strains cause you to get butterflies, give this one a try. Second, the smell was damn unique. It was almost a fresh cut lime, mixed with a frozen blackberry that had just finished thawing out. H...”"
p4cketloss,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1359314,"“There is no questioning this strain from a consumption perspective....but if you plan on growing .....this little jewel vegge's sooooooooo slow. I have a sativa already showing preflowers and 7 nodes tall and my BG hasnt even developed its first preflower. Both germed exact same day and the BG is still crawling to its 5th node. But she  is weellllllll worth the wait!”"

kushlord666,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1370716,"“It's honestly a nice ass strain. It's very chill and makes it really easy to go to bed. The taste is somewhat fruity and it honestly smells like fruity pebbles. It's also one of my favorite strains”"
aarvid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1411318,"“This was a freebie seed from Herbie's that I grew and turned out to be an awesome strain. An indica, but the effects are closer to a balanced hybrid. It gives a little tingle in the brain at first, but the relaxing body effect falls over you and makes this a happy stone.
The smell is really sweet and flowery. The buds are a beautiful, deep purple that are fat and dense. 
I always vape this one and it is such a happy ...”"

YanFlip,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1413492,"“Very sweet, fruity & flowery taste ! Proud of this Canadian made strain. Nice Indica high with a mysterious boost of energy. A must try the taste is amazing and feeling one of a kind.”"

Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1313549,"“Really nice Indica.  Kush and berryish flavors.  Kind of a creeper, and once it sets in, it is full relaxation and tingly body sensations.  Not exactly couch lock though.  I had some good heart pounding and mental stimulation hit me that prevents this from being a sleep inducer.”"
jimmyinspazzz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1418224,"“Bubba's gift is a semi functional flower in that it will not make the user feel sleepy immediately.  This beautiful tasting bud will also not motivate or do anything that involves moving too much.  Found this strain to be very lethargic both on my body & mind which can be very welcoming sometimes.  This flower should be avoided when user needs to be on top of their game.  The flavor is sweet & skunky top notch for th...”"

Marshman66,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1312487,"“Fire...pure indica fire. I've not yet smoked any flower of this strain. I reccomend Phat Panda / Sticky Frog concentrates, Bubba's Gift cake batter. Well worth the $40. Nice workable consistency, generous gram size...and so incredibly flavorful. I can't imagine the bud being any different. Fans of Kosher Kush, Pre-98 Bubba Kush and Afgani #1 will love this.”"

papako1101,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1467701,"“First taste was off a perc bong and it was tasty, not so much of the fruitiness that most people speak of present but still a smooth smoke. Definitely heady but still able to function and not locked down. Nice strain overall.”"

dabzillaearl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1270914,"“Great indica with great genetics! I was definitely seeking these calming effects. Great to sit still yet stay productive during the evening and then easing into catching some deeper sleep or unwinding to a movie. The smaller nugs I had were a vibrant purple and caked with crystals. The smell and taste are heavily accented with a cool berry aroma.”"
rshackleferd,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1368664,"“Ive never been so happy, euphoric, and relaxed in all my life. Puts me in a mood i would love to be in for the rest of my life. I love sitting in my chair and watching the sunrise with this weed. The bud appeal is a ten, the high is a ten, and the potency is around 7.5. The smoke was thick and dank, almost like drinking grape kool aid. It flowered in no time flat, 50 days was stretching it. Vegged real slow.”"
Desn818,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1385015,"“This strain produces some of the best looking buds I've seen personally. The purple and green is so vibrant. It compliments the, what I can only describe as fruit loops, smell. You can smell so many different flavors! The even better thing is, that flavor doesn't burn away when taking even big hits! It's strong! Makes for a beautifully pleasant smoke. Definitely a gradual high, starting with slight body weightlessnes...”"

Nugs I have are Phat Panda grown - not sure what their growing methods are - nugs are very very small, but dense and covered in tricomes., and literally half the leaves are solid purple - some nugs nearly all, some mostly green. Gorgeous, even if so small. Grinds to a nice fluffy but slightly spongy  - e.g. perfect.

Bubba's Gift works amazingly well for my anxiety disorders. As a matter of fact, before I found this stuff I was taking Xanax as needed but since discovering this I haven't had to take it. That is something to be said!”"

HerbeHeureuse,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1286220,"“Tonite I'm smoking on Bubba's Gift, which gets really high ratings.  I wish I could give it high ratings too but I just can't.

Bubba's Gift smells wonderful, like sweet grape/berry. Mine tested at 17.30% THC and .04% CBD. The high, however, is just average, and took 4 bowls to kick in. I've had lower THC strains kick in faster than this one.. So not a disappointment by any means but not in my top 10 either.”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1316215,"“Super calming but didn't leave me feeling sedated or drowsy. Can't recommend it over its parent strain God's Gift but worth checking out if you like indica but want to be functional. 4.5/5”"
Jennifer.mohr,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubbas-gift/reviews/1668489,"“This strain is an interesting case for me. Having smoked God's Gift and enjoying it's euphoric notes, this guy took me by surprise. With effects more similar to a sativa, in the feelings of being energized, alert, and  very a.d.d. The smoke itself is very nice, mellow with an almost cheesey flavor on the exhale. Definitely a strain for getting shit done in an hour or two and then sawing some logs in a nap.”"
