PrincessPuff,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1378856,"“I have chronic pain from degenerative spinal arthritis, which will unfortunately remain with me for my entire life. This strain? Was literally like magic, for me. The relief it gives me is astounding, with only a mild psychoactive effect... The rest is pure relief that casts over my migraines, neck aches, stinging and stabbing back aches and the nausea that comes with chronic 24/7 pain.

Dancehall is literally a mira...”"
rangerdan29,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1398505,"“First of all; this bud is Dense! Covered in crystals and purple hues. This is a sativa dominant strain and performs just as advertised. The smell is earthy and somewhat sweet. Very smooth and easy smoke. Fantastic taste when vaped (flower). This is a head-high smoke and in moderation can really increase creativity and can-do attitude. Great for Depression or social anxiety. When smoked in larger quantities, this stra...”"
kanna37,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1371476,"“Five stars flat out.  If you want something that is going to destroy pain and inflammation but leave you feeling creative and energetic with a clear mind, then you need look no further.  I really like this CBD strain for daytime use, when I don't really want a head high interfering with my mental clarity.  This strain allows me to do my writing without having to fight through a crazy high, and I absolutely love it.  ...”"
MayaMaya1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1359061,"“it's high CBD content is awesome for treating anxiety, epilepsy, pain, muscle spasms, etc. If you're looking for a high THC strain, this is not the one!”"
Niko802,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1359060,"“This high quality medicine has allowed me to have a much better quality of life as I suffer from chronic back pain. For some reason this resinous & fragrant boutique flower allows me to take less pain medicine which I have been taking for over 13 years. Quality natural organic medicine!”"
MWS420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1688396,"“I am a 32 year old Autistic adult (I'm slightly less Autistic than "Asperger's", I guess that's the best way to explain it). 

This is quickly becoming my favorite strain. I am finding that Cannabis, especially Sativa's, don't just help with my autism, I feel like I'm permanently being changed for the better.

This strain specifically, along with Jack Herer (will do my review of this strain soon as well), seem to be ...”"

panicfan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1371475,"“only tried the vapor with this strain and its my favorite so far.  Body more so over heady but great!”"
JimmyNuts,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1359067,"“The parents of Dance Hall are Juanita la Lagrimosa (a renowned medical cross of NYC Diesel + Reina Madre) and Kalijah (Blue Heaven + NYC Diesel).  A great medicinal strain with a relatively high CBD content.”"
chickenfingers,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1490287,"“Phenomenal strain, would recommend to anyone looking to experience a high CBD sativa with no tiring side-effects. If you get this strain organic (certified), it will smell like tropical fruit, cloves and subtle mint/lemon hints. There is also the common CBD smell which brings a subtle warmth/earthiness into the mix. 

When smoked, this flower tastes primarily like ripe peaches and honey, with a decadent flowery/earth...”"
YoWeedNigga,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1359062,"“Perfect if you go outside”"
lilaxmoon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1303356,"“This is the second CBD strain I've smoked and I really really like it for day time smoking. Especially before I have to go out into a social setting. Calms me down, gives me energy, makes me social and giggly. I suffer from a panic disorder and BPD (borderline personality disorder) and my episodes of mood swings that can occur in seconds have been so bad lately, but I smoke this strain and it instantly calms me down,...”"
a420paradise,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1359063,"“A Nice earthy, berry, taste ...
And the smell is exactly the same, paired with a creative high which is great for social relations.”"
notnick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1200332,"“Perfect for smoking before getting a drink with friends, or right when you wake up. As someone who gets anxious and depressed, Dancehall doesn't make me feel "high", just happy.”"
chubbystonerchick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1359065,"“Best CBD strain by far.”"
nwcbd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1363822,"“Best cbd I've tried, many strains don't compare to their description as well as this gem.”"

dcalvert08,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1302838,"“I suffer from constant siatica nerves being pinched. After 3 days of constant back spasms and numb legs I decided to try a new strain to help. Probably one of the best cbd strains I have tried. No more spasms or pain at the moment.”"
alittlebacio,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1309671,"“One of the most clear-headed spirit lifting strains you can come across. Hard to find. Hard to find done well. When treated with care during grow, you can feel her energy explode over time, especially during a late flower and rigorous bloom. Doesn't need over-care but beware, prone to mold. She has very unique effects if put under a variety of conditions. "Perfect" conditions will cause her to have dense, exotic buds...”"
SensimillaSmoka,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1387632,"“As a sativa dominant strain, it gives you a very strong and mental highness, but in my opinion the both flavor and smell are too spicy: it seems to smoke origan, chili pepper and curry.
Not recommended for night-time use and for the good fellows of the real hemp strains' flavors.”"
papablunted,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1551768,"“Very buzzy head high. Tasty, has a fruity smell and a fruity/spicy flavor. Can be anxiety provoking with balancing with some indica or the right mind state. Strong head high borders on psychedelic.”"
Surname,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1501599,"“One of the best strains I’ve ever tasted, and it’s just as explained. I’m a 21 communication and design student, and when you “measure the dose”, gives you a flash of creativity and motivation, but also depends on how and when you smoke it, situation may change the effects, but generally, great feeling. 
Have a great time, take care🍁🔥”"

darkoverlordofdata,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1418233,"“The flavor is missing something, like eating a salt free pretzel. The buzz reminds me of NyQuil. I have trouble reading, if I close my eyes for one second and I'm asleep. Not fun.”"

taycheese81,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1371477,"“Smells like blueberries. Gives me a very nice outer body experience. Kinda like the way you feel when you are put under with anesthesia like propofol. I love the feeling gets me chilled for bed even tho it is Sativa dominant.”"
N7StonerStat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1379453,"“Like many, this strain has made an impact on my life!

Highly recommend for those looking for a smooth relief of pain through the body that keeps your head clear!”"

De las mejores variedades que he podido cosechar este 2017. Muy interesante también por sus cualidades medicinales.”"
JJM1961,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dancehall/reviews/1715107,"“This is by far the worst weed I’ve purchased in a very long time. Thankfully I only bought 2 grams to try and because it was very expensive. I smoked and smoked and smoked and honestly I don’t know what everyone is raving on about because I didn’t even get a buzz. I’ve smoked some pretty shitty stuff in my lifetime and, in my opinion, this one has to be the worst.”"
