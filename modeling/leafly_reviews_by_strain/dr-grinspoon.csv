After smoking 10 bong hits I went into a dark room and visions one after another came to me with music, voices, amazing sounds.  Creative ideas I had never thought before rushed into my mind.  The high lasted 35 minutes, and it was the most creative experience of my life.  This is a revolutionary strain that will change the world.  This is w...”"

Its a strain that looks like no other, growns like a weeping willow, clocks in at over 25% THC, almost no CBD, and smells like extreme citrus bathroom cleaner. I'm a  migraine and IBS sufferer, but would NOT recommend Grinspoon for migraines - this strain is 100...”"

Very strange looking weed, the buds are made of several little clusters loosely bound together but completely covered by crystals. 
The smoke was mild and went down very smooth, not much expansive in the lungs, hardly it will make to cough.
The best part which really stands out in my opinion is the high, a creeper and all in the head, very alert but not too spe...”"
