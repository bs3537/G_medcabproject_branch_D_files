Got hold of a sample so didn't have too much and ended up sharing one joints worth between 3 of us - and it's a good job too. Fried the lot of us and safe to assume you don't need much of this to feel the full effects. Was a smooth smoke which took me by surprise but nevertheless a bonus.  At first I was in a heavy body high state, bu...”"

Definately my favourite so far!...”"

Weed is weed, and high is high, but when you've grown a tolerance the high it becomes more comfortable than exciting. This weed takes me on different roller-coaster rides each time I smoke it.

We did a couple rounds before we got high. I took one huge hit towards the middle and right when I took that hit I was smacked. Get it if you wanna be incredibly happy stoned.
