I grabbed it the first day and have been experimenting with it for a week on and off.  I really don't have much to say.  I don't think it's a unique strain for me, it does not stand out.  I didn't notice a hard hit or even a good feel, just blaze.  Now, Tikun's Sativa strains are out of this world!”"

Buds are big and fluffy, a fair amount of dry leaves hide fruity sweet nugs of orange goodness. Light green, indica dominant yet doesn't seat you on your ass. After grinding, the result is green/white, from all the crystals in the bud. It's nighttime yet good for day use in moderation. Highly reco...”"

Kind of reminded me of kosher kush the way to makes you feel at ease. Great if your really trying to relax. I can see how it might be better at night. I'd recommend to anyone especially if you prefer indicas”"
