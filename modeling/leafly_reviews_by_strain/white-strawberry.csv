Tested at 23% thc for the batch i got, cleared one fat bowl and was on cloud 9. Did get a slight headache after but if you wake and bake with this strain its not as bad.”"
levitaylor78,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-strawberry/reviews/1289973,"“well said seanzy84. strain hunters seeds white strawberry is a very nice smoke. A little moreish with that fruity flavour and a creamy texture. A feel good smoke. My only problem is her leaf ratio in flower is too much and her buds are not as dense as I'd like.”"

Doesn't get me feeling anything just makes me buzzed BARELY and  does not help with my depression and stress. I was told it was great but maybe I just got a bad batch. I will review again later when I come across it again!”"
