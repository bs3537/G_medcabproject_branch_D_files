Blue Cheese
=============
spacejunkOG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1417776,"‚ÄúThis is somehow the only indica-dominant strain I can smoke during the day.  It's amazing for anxiety and stress relief, while not making you too tired.  I feel like Blue Cheese is what Blue Dream was trying to be but you just can't beat this stuff, and again *it doesn't make me sleepy*.  I had to buy a zip and put it in the freezer for the zombie apocalypse.   This is also my girlfriend's favorite strain for sex.  A...‚Äù"
Ganja Juice,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1417500,"‚ÄúThis by far is the best strain EVER created by man...
The best Blueberry and the best UK/or Cheese mashed together for a joyful experiance.
My favorite version of this strain is the DJ Bluebbery shorts X UK Cheese. This is the absolute best med out there...i know because i smoke them all for a living...
THIS STRAIN WORKS WONDERS FOR ALL THAT TRY IT!!!!!!!‚Äù"
FoxyRex,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1413749,"‚ÄúNew favorite strain!!! I suffer from tourettes so I'm always stuck for daytime meds because indicas help my condition but make me sleepy. Blue cheese works wonders! A couple hits and my stress melts away as my body relaxes, my smile widens, and my tics leave me. Very relaxed feeling but not a heavy feeling like I get with indicas. Morning, day, afternoon or night this is great any time of the day!!‚Äù"
deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1416547,"‚Äúüí£üî• You know how some dogs are so ugly that they're cute, like pugs? Blue Cheese is so disgustingly stinky, just one whiff will widen your eyes and you may just laugh at how much it actually resembles a slab of Gorgonzola. This strain reeks so bad that it's good. This is the worst smelling strain you will ever love. Such a unique flavor and an even more unique high! Perfect for stress and winding down after a long d...‚Äù"
TechnoNshWeed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1416594,"‚ÄúI think I'm falling in love with all cheese strains. Blue Cheese is no exception. A marvelous strain that provides the general relaxed, euphoric, stoned buzz. Local dispensary claimed it was a sativa dominant hybrid, didn't feel like it too much. I would say that it did provide a spark of creativity, and had somewhat of a cerebral stimulation. But for the most part it is an indica dominant strain minus the heavy need...‚Äù"
hotrod1228,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1418008,"‚ÄúMid size, tight nugs. Dense, proper finish. Two solid bong rips and within two minutes my left ear stops working and after a few more minutes i realize im staring in to spce, open mouthed, the how to flip real estate with no money or sense infomercial reduced to a low hum in the background. Burritos, bro.  fuckin a.‚Äù"
EatWeedSmokeYogurt,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1416893,"‚ÄúBlue cheese is such a great daytime smoke, Its one of them strains which slightly creep on you (5-10mins) then BAM! You feel it first cover your head in a warm blanket, you start to feel it slowly wrapping your whole body into a euphoric mellow high which is absolutely great because this Stain is easy to work with anywhere! 

I could be anywhere  high on blue cheese and could handle my self easily without monging out...‚Äù"
woamotive,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1418007,"‚ÄúOf the 3 strains I have on hand : blue cheese, blue dream, and purple passion this is my favorite daytime cannabis. Strangely (I've never experienced this before with marijuana) it really increases my level of arousal - and lately this is great because my sex drive is super low.

Also, I can go about my day 'as normal' but with a nice relaxed mind. Stress is a constant (HIGH) in my life right now so this strain is ...‚Äù"
Weedsprin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1396208,"‚ÄúI smoked this strain at the beginning of my weight loss adventure and ended up losing 100 pounds.  

The Indica effects helped me focus on my goal and relax while changing my diet, exercising and sleeping better.

The taste was delicious and the smoke was thick.  I used a water pipe and had a great time with this strain.‚Äù"
MeditationMedication,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1410444,"‚ÄúAs an indica-only smoker, I have to say BC is one of my favorites. It creeps up on you slower than most and it is a total body relaxer - great bed time medication. The name fits perfect with the smell and taste. At my dispensary we go through this faster than any other indica. A good head buzz and perfect for anxiety. Love me some Blue Cheese.‚Äù"
MadBuzzer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1337738,"‚ÄúIf you have a few hours to kill and want to go deep into the rabbit hole, this is your bud. Two tasty hits and I was suddenly very relaxed. After four, I found myself in front of the bathroom mirror with a clear idea of my own importance. I felt good. I stood there and talked to myself for at least 30 minutes. Justified previous decisions or tried to be honest about current motivations. Cried as childhood memories we...‚Äù"

Couchlock and sedation galore. Smells and tastes like blue cheese just without that milky smell. Small patches of purple. Elite dank.‚Äù"

maxmarkowitz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1368761,"‚ÄúThis strain is HELLA trippy. It makes everything look distorted. At first i didn't like the taste but the high was worth it.‚Äù"
nickrazza,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1389591,"‚ÄúOh, Blue Cheese.... how do you do, those things you do.

It has a sweet, pungent taste that's unlike most full indica strains I've had, very noticeable onset with almost a childish giggly feeling,
indica creeps over the shoulders in due time leaving the user in a steady, blissful, & calm state of mind. 
Great for back pain, nausea, insomnia,
even just going about your daily routine!
4.5/5

DrGreenLung101,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1344742,"‚ÄúGreat tasting. I love cheese strains because of the taste. Gives an amazing euphoric high and makes you very relaxed, but happy and talkative. Great for a toke before bed, or before or at a gathering of friends, family, etc. Blue Cheese is a very social weed. You will find yourself very relaxed with a smooth head and body high that kicks in pretty quickly and stays for a while, declining at a slow, pleasant rate. Wou...‚Äù"

The smoke was smooth and thick, coating my mouth with a funky berry taste. Not sure I tasted cheese, but something that was definitely funky was going on under that well-known blueberry zing.

hwyblues,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1330745,"‚ÄúBlue Cheese is my current favorite and I'd like more, please! It makes me very happy and super spacey, with some psychedelic effects, topped off with extra chill. Makes me want to listen to music, or watch cartoons, or both. Or take a stroll around the neighborhood on a sunny day. Very dense buds of a good size. Nice smell and taste. Highly recommended!‚Äù"
InMyOwnZone951,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1324967,"‚ÄúMy favorite strain. I rated and gave a review a couple months back, but I gotta come back and give it another because this shit is good! PERFECT for my anxiety and will make you feel as if your weight in your body is GONE. Not a creeper, this will make you have an instant head change and clarity for thinking in depth of things.

I honestly started smoking more faster Because the smoke was so smooth lol.‚Äù"

If anyone can get their hands on organically grown Blue Cheese, I suggest you grab up as much as you can. The taste and smell are just wonderful.

TheStonervingian,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese/reviews/1387187,"‚ÄúThey say some people stay away from Indica because of the In Da Couch feeling, this is not that strain, probably the most functional indica there is with a nearly full spectrum of recreational and medical benefits, you can't go wrong by choosing this strain because you'll be just as happy going out and having fun as staying in. One of my personal favorites.‚Äù"
