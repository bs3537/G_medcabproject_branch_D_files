easthood,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-quake/reviews/1416348,"“Cheese quake is some pretty dank weed. Nice, euphoric high that knocks you out. Great strain to smoke shortly before going to bed. Downside is that this strain makes you cough like a MF, leaving you with a sore throat sometimes.”"

Buckshot00,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-quake/reviews/1392881,"“3.5 stars for this relaxing Indica with a secret Sativa side. Was a recommendation from the Herbal Wellness kid and I was skeptical, but it is not terrible. Euphoric and easygoing. Also can build high with subsequent smokes - no plateauing of the high. Cheese is gross, but these effects are smooth like Brie.”"
PandaOG15,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-quake/reviews/1278588,"“Very uplifting and a happy high. Highly recommend for anyone with a low sex drive. It's smooth and a good strain.”"
the420mon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-quake/reviews/1392892,"“Great mellow head high. Fairly happy and uplifted. Find this to be very sedating, but not in a heavy couch lock kind of way, more of a "happy and melt your pain away" kind of a high. Good body feel.
The flavor profile and taste are great as well, you get the earthy cheese flavors come up.
Good for nausea and general pain.

Would buy again!”"

I felt part of my brain actually lift up after I tried it, and its relaxing qualities calmed me down almost immediately and made me pain-free and relaxed.  The buds burn smoothly and the flavor has no after bite as some of the stronger varieties of Indicas.  I would highly recommend Cheese Quake for those with migraine, insomnia, and seizures.”"
