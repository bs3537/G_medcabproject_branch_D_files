A bit of a harsh smoke, but with excellent effects. I was very giggly and happy, played Cards Against Humanity, in stitches for hours =) I also felt more creative. Would definitely smoke again.
5/5 Stitches.”"

It felt gentle but swift, and deceptively strong. It lifted my head up in a slightly disconnected way that put distance between my stresses and worries and me, while also giving my body a warm, comforting glow. My heart glowed hardest, like I was radiating (and feeling!) pure love for everyone I care about, past and present, friends and famil...”"

MedicalIncredible,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-dream/reviews/1222772,"“Most attractive looking of all Leafs by Snoop flowers 

Tons of Trichomes 

Most likely a Blue Dream type strain 

I smell Oregon Blueberry 
But I also smell a peppery spicy smell 
Even a pickle smell 
Yes Pickle 

Leafly claims it's only 14% THC

We'll see about that ;)”"
