Chimaera,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-terror-og/reviews/1394205,"“Hooooo baby, I just got some last night to treat some worsening insomnia and I am in love with this variety! Took about 0.1g and vaped it through my SSV, the flavors were outstanding, delicious grape and berry with a light piney finish. Took a little while to set in but the relaxation was exceptional and I was quite sedate, shedding the day's earlier anxiety. I fell asleep about 30 minutes after vaping and woke up ab...”"

It smoothly relaxed me into a solid 7 hrs of sleep, with nice pain relief, muscle relaxation and a calm mind. No small feat with a fused lumbar spine, arthritis and CPTSD on board nightly.”"
Subie786,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-terror-og/reviews/1739606,"“For someone who has anxiety this strain is a great night time option.

I felt a little intoxicated for 30 minutes,  after that it was smooth sailing and eventually off to bed. A little goes a long way.”"
LilBrownRabbit,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-terror-og/reviews/1547986,"“Beautiful, under appreciated solid indica strain. Vapes mellow & fruity, crescendoes to a lovely light body feeling, then settles in good and hard. Watch out—enough of this strain will stop you in your tracks. Couch lock is real. Tactile and happy, problems wash away, colors and patterns. Perhaps not the norm but this got psychedelic on me with closed-eye visuals and some brilliant explosions, bubble-gum popping in m...”"

Definitely got that dank look. They are nice and compact with purple, green, and  some red hairs also. Nice dusting of trichomes, too. The flavor is very smooth, I didn't cough my ass off like I have before with other OG's. The first time I smoke it. Now to the high. The flowers I got were aro...”"

JJH3885,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-terror-og/reviews/1187975,"“Definitely has the Blue Dream characteristics but has its own qualities that separates it from its lineage.

BluntBubble,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-terror-og/reviews/1594934,"“The aroma that comes of the flower is strong, neutral, and pleasant. Microdosing is recommended, I found that there were few activities to enjoy, other than being a zombie on the couch. I enjoyed a 2-3 hour window where the effects were pleasant, and there really was no crash or munchies. Laid back. I normally do not enjoy and partake in Indicas, but thus was a treat. Get for the weekend indoors.”"
Bigperm18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-terror-og/reviews/1382461,"“Wow!.. Where do I start?.. Not many strains impress me to the point of this one .

tfallucca,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-terror-og/reviews/1532805,"“Superb genetics!! This is a wonderful strain for insomnia, PTSD and anxiety; all of which are extremely heightened for me since I started detoxing from an awful, super heavy benzo 6 weeks ago. I smoked about half of a 1 gram preroll and I don’t remember falling asleep!! I woke up a couple hours later feeling refreshed, creative and happy. This is definitely my new #1 night-time flower.

I Vaped a bowl with my girl out on the patio and I was stuck in the chair for a good while.”"
BluntBubble,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-terror-og/reviews/1529345,"“OMG groggy and sleepy within minutes. Perfect for my knee pain, buft I would not recommend if you're facing an active day. Smells like a dark waxy crayon, and she broke up great into shake and keif in my grinder. Results may vary, but for me, it was a little heavy, like a Xanax bar.”"
spongecrazy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/night-terror-og/reviews/1369736,"“major head high that make your body feel heavy. major dry mouth and eye. intense feeling if hunger.

I will do my best to review a myriad of different strains. Any-whosies, this strain was considered one of the cannaseur level strains at Medicine Man in Glendale, CO. I would happily agree with them on this. My initial impression was "wow" this strain looks great, smells ...”"

Quick-moving body high that sends comforting relaxation through limbs and back and shoulders. Not too heady, just puts a faint smile on your face as you reacquaint yourself with all your cells. Chill, happy, not crazy but superb for insomnia. Always guarantees me an undisturbed 8 or 9 hours of sleep.”"
