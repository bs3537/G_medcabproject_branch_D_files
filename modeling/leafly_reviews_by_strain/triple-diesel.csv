My muscle spasms in my legs went away within 20 minutes. The burning pains in my thigh muscles and arms went down dramatically and unlocked my stiff joints. This is also the 1st strain that didn't give me the munchies at all. My mood was good and carefree from previously being dramatically stress. I also became sleepy within the 35 minute period but...”"

Docs put me on opiates and muscle relaxers and Volterran. The opiates and muscle relaxers kept me from going to work. The  Volterran made me pass blood in my stool. 


A friend convinced me to try cann...”"
matty.heathcock,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/triple-diesel/reviews/1282008,"“A combination of probably the 3 best Diesel Strains. Although all Sativas (New York, Sour, Strawberry) is very much like a Indica in it's effects on the body, but still retains the Sativa effects that made Sour D legendary.  It is fast acting and packs a punch.”"
caitdiane22,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/triple-diesel/reviews/1614388,"“Love this strain so much! I picked this up here in East LA (14gs for $75 - top shelf) for 420 and my gf and I are smoking the heck out of it. It literally gives you a euphoric and strong head high, taking you to another planet for a good 20 mins. I have been so stressed and depressed lately and I must say this strain did the trick in relaxing my mind from racing thoughts and made me laugh about the stupidest shit. Go...”"
panthro,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/triple-diesel/reviews/1360682,"“3 hits off my vape and I was feeling great! Feel it in my face and forehead and all over my upper body. Way more powerful than the NYC Diesel I just finished up. If your an inexperienced smoker be cautious as this is some potent stuff.”"
ajuk2k,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/triple-diesel/reviews/1360681,"“Great heady Sativa with amazing diesel smell! However you can't really stay focused and it can make you sleepy if you're not a frequent smoker. Still really like this strain and it was triple boat times !”"

Sativa effects, but I felt relaxation in my lower body. I smoked in the afternoon and was able to function just fine, just don’t go too far if you’re not planning on being a little spacey 😏 Perfect for anything from just chilling by yourself and watching Netflix/Hulu or group activities or even sleep i...”"
icysurfer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/triple-diesel/reviews/1152288,"“Pain relief, much more - ONLY when harvested more than 9 weeks of flower. 63-70 days.. Not really particularly sweet, but more so than the Original East Coast Sour Diesel Cut. (Chemdog x Massachusetts Super Skunk). A joy to grow, smoke, trim (almost), and make concentrates from. (always nicely colored).”"

Really relaxing and makes my back pains melt away while making me feel mellow. I can do some work on this, but depends on the quantity smoked. This will truly leave you couch-locked if you dare to chill for a moment. Dense trichomes and crystals will leave you in awe of this plant. Those with paranoia, anxiety or irritabilit...”"

And so I did I chased it the more I smoke well I just felt extremely stone to the point where the energy became more of a relaxed mode. Still a great strain loved it would get it again!”"
ChuckWillyDuece,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/triple-diesel/reviews/1743508,"“This is an amazing strain for social interaction. I felt like i was the funniest man alive. No brain fog, and only good vibes. Recommend for any recreational user who prefers imbibing with friends.”"
elliotgalbraith,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/triple-diesel/reviews/1343389,"“Gets you flying high during the day without any risk of anxious energies hindering that feeling you want. Keeps you nicely relaxed in the head and able to sit through the most boring of university lectures. The high concentration of tricombs makes this herb a beautiful piece to look at, inspiring thoughts of making it into the most perfect saving strain I can think of. Definitely wish I could have this one around at ...”"

Could cause a little anxiety/paranoia in those that are naturally jumpy. After peak high, which I found to come and go fairly quick, it is just relaxed.”"

Triple Diesel made that list when i got an oz of it last night. despite NYC+Strawberry Diesel in the genes, no fruityness, just strait gas. keroseney/diesel and pepper smell cuts through everything.

Like the overview says, very indica like, which isn't cup of tea. However, 2-3 puffs and it does me proper. Very calming and took away a splitting headache I had within minutes.”"

BlitzFury,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/triple-diesel/reviews/1359405,"“Strawberry Diesel, Sour Diesel, and New York Diesel. 
A satisfying dominant strain. I can smoke it all day and not get tired. More of a head high than a body high. I grew some indica Purple Elephant that would put me to sleep in 30 minutes and I smoked it every day for 3 months. This is definitely a Sativa. I'm a grower for a store, so I'm not going to totally put it down. The flowers I got from another store are flu...”"

OnlytheFinestGreen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/triple-diesel/reviews/1064602,"“Took a hit and loved the diesel smell of the smoke. The taste? I could just imagine myself pumping a full tank of gas while chewing strawberry mint gum. Within a few minutes, the audio and visual effects were evident. I was able to relax with ease and enjoy a few reruns of shows in a new way.”"

This was a creeper, doesn't hit right away, hits later, then later again.  Do too much and you'll be rolling on the floor.  Went straight to my head, gave me anxiety - didn't help with what I needed.  Smells pungent and musky with a little flower and pine scents.  Tasted light, some pine, earthy, burnt ...”"

Very strong effects with some heaviness though focusing on the task at hand was easy.

Not my choice for a first taste of the day.  Any other time bring it on.

Busts out large and "sour/sweet chemical" is what a freshly grinded pile brings to mind.

No ugly tastes or feelings.
