Flower: nice smaller sized buds and not as loose as a typical sativa. 
Smell: definitely sweet with a little bit of citrus. Has that old school earthy bud smell. 
Crumble: kinda dry batch so it ground poorly. I was left with a lot of keif looking stuff. 
Burn: because it was dry, it burned faster and harsher than usual. 
Taste: pretty much mirrored the smell, a little skunky. 
High: I'm n...”"

Thanks Swell for giving me RedX. It gave me a sense of being aware.  I also felt like my muscles were relaxing and I could actually get things done for a couple of hours.
I smoke out of a bong and the flavor of the weed lasts throughout the bowl.  Awesome taste too.  Almost a Tangerine flavor.”"
