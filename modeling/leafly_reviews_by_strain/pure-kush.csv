Very tiny amount of paranoia at the peak of the experience, but it faded quickly into giggles. This is a VERY strong strain, so a little goes a long way.”"

danthonythegreat,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-kush/reviews/1262376,"“This is definitely in my top five all time best indicas list. For starters, when using your grinder, you'll notice an intense amount of thick, cheesy, dusty broken down bud. I had a motorcycle accident a couple months ago, and instead of taking the pills, this strain has helped me like none other. The high is happy, euphoric, but not stoner lazy. I almost want to say it starts off like a sativa, but rather be jittery...”"
Olawles,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-kush/reviews/1273959,"“I grew this and harvested a bit early to get a bit of a sativa kick, and it's a very strong-smelling strain that delivers a fantastic behind-the-eyes high that lasts for hours. Harvesting it a bit early for that sativa kick helped, I could smoke and I wasn't totally locked down, but I still got the relaxed body high it normally provides.

Definitely worth a try!”"
