And despite the description, I was able to go home at 11:30, devour a can of Sour Cream and Onion Pringles, pass out, and wake up at 5:45 for school with absolutely no problem. Probably one of the best strains I've ever smoked.”"

If you havent had this strain before or its been a while, go easy at first its kinda strong at first.  It also gave me the munchies. So if you need to eat more this will do the trick.

EMM,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/east-coast-sour-diesel/reviews/1392040,"“ECSD , is on the milder side of potency , but not too mild  , its a sativa that keeps you happy , focused , uplifted , with just the right amount of euphoria ; it's not so overwhelming that your zombified with such intense euphoria . A perfectly balanced Sativa , better than original sour D. in my opinion . 
As a 99% Sativa smoker , this is definitely one of my top 3 favorites .”"

Dr. Greenthumb has a cut that's tested 30% THC (not sure if it was just THC, THCA, or sum of both) which is nuts! This strain also looks amazing along w/ smell n taste. Done correctly it's just a flawless strain IMO, but newbys beware it can b intense cerebrally. So mayb skip this one if ur new to the scene.”"
