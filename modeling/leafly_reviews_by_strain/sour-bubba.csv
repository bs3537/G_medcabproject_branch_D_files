      Started with a very heavy high behind the eyes and then ... blast off ...euphoria. I may have over indulged when I filled the volcano for the fifth time but I couldn't resist with this beauty. Great hybrid smoke started v...”"

The body effects are enchanting. You'll feel yourself floating after the first hit. You become "very aware of what your skeleton is doing," according to SWIM. It's "like you can feel the air on your skin and the hair on your legs growing."

Your body will feel good, basically.

The taste is great, hard to describe. Maybe like sal...”"

Combining strains surprisingly doesn’t always work as expected, so it’s extra special these two combine like they were made for each other. On their own, they’re each best of class - but together, they complement and fill in each other to create a wonderfully rounded experience. I lost half the high distractedly tending to my plants while smoking outside. Beautiful for nature in that it’s both visc...”"

Cakezoid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubba/reviews/1362582,"“This is probably within my top favorites. Although I'm more of a sativa person, this hybrid balance is perfect. After your first few hits you really start to feel it, hits pretty nicely. It's more of a cerebral heady high, yet your body feels fantastic, just floating and going with the flow. One recommendation I have while on this particular strain is STRETCH. You'll thank me later, and so will your muscles. The cere...”"

The buds are almost white from how many crystals there are. Taste is magnificent. There's a 0% chance of you being angry or depressed after smoking this strain, everything about this bud will make you happy.”"

StGolden,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubba/reviews/1382534,"“This one hits you really hard really fast and it's totally fun. The only downfall is that the fun only lasts for about 2-3 hours then you have to spark up again. The coming down portion makes you really sleepy and the fun part wears off.”"
jemitts,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubba/reviews/1604691,"“I bought an ounce of sour bubba from a dispensary in the next town over based off the the breeding (sour diesel x Bubba kush) and medical properties for pain and stress. 
I really like this strain it starts out in my head with energy and focus for about 45 minutes and ends up in the body with a blank mind leaving me on the couch relaxed for the next 2 hrs. 
As I smoked on it I noticed that it was packed with seeds 23...”"

Good for watching movies for sure my concentration is definitely up but the body high you will inevitably feel with this one will cause you to chill to the point of sleep”"

anhelz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubba/reviews/1572009,"“Its a very tasty strain indeed if u like a sour diesel tone but somewhat sweet. this bud seems like it locks you down to the seat for a minuted but with a creative side to it with a mellow hit of bubba kush,...... great balance of both nd pretty strong high to go with it”"
KYDLA,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubba/reviews/1753321,"“This strain is a new favorite. I’ve decided this after I woke up this afternoon from an early bedtime induced by sour bubba. I rolled a backwoods and the smoke was pulling and hitting very very well. I immediately felt relief in my shoulders and behind my eyes. That followed by a trip to the couch and a very long uninterrupted slumber. I felt like a bear hibernating”"
