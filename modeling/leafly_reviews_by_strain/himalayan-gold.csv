ELNiNo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/himalayan-gold/reviews/1324425,"‚ÄúTaste is earthy and very neutral. The buzz is up in your head (high effect), you feel tingly and at peace with yourself. Effects are felt olmost instantly, so there are no surprises. It lasts for about an hour and as fast the buzz comes in it gets out. In conclusion I would say a very potent strain that gives you a nice natural feel. A definite day smoke since you return to normal in a good hour.

Had a very natural "hay" smell to it (probably due to curing reasons?) but had a great energetic kick to it. I used to blaze at the top of this mountain in my community and look at the little city lights as I smoked this with my best friend. It was also great for morning bakes too because it had no afterbake.‚Äù"
