It's very Euphoric. I loved it for it's medicinal purposes. Whenever I felt bad from my multiple sclerosis I would smoke some and. Actually feel normal like nothing was wrong. I am out and haven't had any since last December after I carried it home with me. But we will meet again soon because I'll...”"

Phunkshunal,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ghost-rider-og/reviews/1738903,"“Definitely lives up to its reputation. Very dense, slow burning buds, give you a moderate body high, which diminish stress and anxiety within minutes. And the aroma and taste are just what you would expect from any Kush/Kush-hybrid... Pure Goodness! Love this hybrid!”"
NickyFG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ghost-rider-og/reviews/1659401,"“I am going to say this is the heavy hitter. I don't usually care for strong Indica but this strain is enjoyable for me. If you primarily love Indica strains you must find it and try it. I don't think the piney smell is as pleasant as other piney smelling types. It's strong. It's body high. Good for insomnia, anxiety and nerve pain.”"

I ran into some money today. I bought Ghost Rider with what I had and I can’t believe how beautiful this one is. Right off the bat, the euphoria washed over my body. Nothing like harder psychedelics but for cannabis I was very impressed. My anxiety, which has been too high for a month, was alleviated wave by wave/hit by...”"

Ghost Rider OG doesn’t behave like a typical Indica for me, this one acts a bit like a Sativa.”"
