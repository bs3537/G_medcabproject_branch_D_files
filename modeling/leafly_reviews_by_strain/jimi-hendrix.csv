greendandy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jimi-hendrix/reviews/1252614,"“Love love love this strain! As a big fan of headband I couldn't wait to try it, and I was not let down. This strain is euphoric and absolutely a little psychedelic. I laughed with my friends like we were in high school (we are in our thirties ;)  It was an great finish to an evening out. Just a few hits during the day of this stuff and I was immediately feeling some very creative vibes. If you come across this strain...”"

Its aroma has strong accents of Berry, Lemon, and a Pineapple, with a back-end of candy sweetness. For many this will be a fantastic evening strain, as it is definitely Indica-dominant. For me, this strain makes me active, energetic, and euphoric. This strain is always a bit pricey, but worth it. Found at Amazon Organics.”"

elviaje26,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jimi-hendrix/reviews/1301383,"“Not super comfy, clear-headed, or active. Defined bouts of physical sensations. Not a weed that you get flashback social memories with. A tad paranoia mixed in. I feel a bit particular about how things should be with this weed.”"

BOS6,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jimi-hendrix/reviews/1272835,"“I was lucky and found this for five bucks a gram and oh my best fifteen bucks I ever spent made me feel just so uplifted an creative im almost certain I could probably play some jimi on the guitar after a couple more bowls and Ive never played a day in my life lol 👍👍👍”"
TheAnimePiper,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jimi-hendrix/reviews/1241723,"“Picked this up today from Fireside as a recommendation from one of the budtenders. I feel overall good/happy/peace of mind. Definitely recommend trying it!”"
SpaceRangerDomTowers,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jimi-hendrix/reviews/1283965,"“Okay, I vaped this Hendrix twice: the first time, I was on a molly and it was coming down. Omg did this bud came through - I mean it was an electric feeling. So so so good. Second time, I vaped I wasn't expecting the same result, but it was almost the same. The high is subtle, electric, vibrant, and I highly recommend it for a party night.”"

Got a more earthy smelling flower than the fruity one described by the strain highlight. Good sativa dominant hybrid for sure, took care of my stomach pain near instantly!”"
