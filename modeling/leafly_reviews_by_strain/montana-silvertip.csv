The smell is very sweet, almost carmel like. When vaped you are hit with an incredible grape flavor, like purple gatorade! The flowers are dense and caked in trichromes. A very blanced hybrid. You can feel both the parent genetics clearly and they seem to work harmoniously. You get the head high from the ssh and th...”"

The bud itself is a beautiful specimen, with light green and purple, and covered in orange hairs.

A great tasting bud that is great to enjoy with the local scenery.  Recommend grinding with a keef catcher, and trust me, there is a lot of keef to be caught.”"

Great euphoria and happiness. Giggly with no anxiety. Decently relaxed. Feel it in my arms and neck. I really like this strain. Lime green dense compact lime green nugs covered in amber trich. Moderate amount of small orange hairs. Smells like sweet hash and coriander. I would get MS again. It's good for me.”"

Gives you a quick heady-high (clean, where you don't have to worry about it impinging your speech).

Perfect hybrid of GDP and SSH. You can clearly feel the parent strains effects but they come together to form a cohesive high. One of my favorite "chill out strains".  A true hybrid feeling.”"
