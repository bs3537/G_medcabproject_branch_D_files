thenuttyprofessor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mango-kush/reviews/1417073,"‚ÄúVery potent. Hit this twice off a vaporizer at a dinner party and passed on the third and fourth rounds cause i was already good. Nice sativa start put me in a great mood, lots of laughs but didn't get stupid.

Royalty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mango-kush/reviews/1084866,"‚ÄúMango Kush gave me a great high. I felt very at ease and relaxed, as well as happy and very social. One good hit of this strain and I felt the effects. Fortunately for me, it didn't give me the munchies, which I thought of as an upside to the high. Once the high was gone I felt sleepy but well rested also. I'd suggest this strain if you are going to a relaxed social occasion (not a big party or anything like that) or...‚Äù"
