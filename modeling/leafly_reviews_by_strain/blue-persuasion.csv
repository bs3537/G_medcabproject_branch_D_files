BatLogan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-persuasion/reviews/1376944,"“I wasn't very impressed by this strain. It had a pretty weak aroma, and while it got me high it just wasn't anything special. For the price I could've got something much tastier, prettier, and effective.”"
TressaMae,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-persuasion/reviews/1376943,"“This is my favorite strain to smoke at the end of the day! It's pretty sweet smelling and smooth to inhale too”"
Stealth13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-persuasion/reviews/1376950,"“Sweet smelling, sweet tasting, with a high THC % to boot, this grass is an all around powerhouse. Blueberry NLights and White Widow were already some of my favorite strains. Combine them and you get a fruity sweet blend that'll knock you on your ass. Price was just right on this guy, $160 for a half an oz is a deal.”"

Looks amazing, taste is fine, high is a creeper. My new favorite mix tho is a bowl of Sour Kush and a bowl of Blue Persuasion and I'm on cloud 9. So happy and smiling and laughing. Amazing Combination I must say! EnjoyWeed!”"

Mine seemed heavy on the indica side but really put a smile on my face nonetheless as the anxiety melted away and comfort washed over my body. Quite potent certainly not panic inducing, had the urge to talk a lot. Focused high as well, clear and not spacey.”"
