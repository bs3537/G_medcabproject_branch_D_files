John18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hell-raiser-og/reviews/1417178,"“I purchased a 1/2 oz. of Hell Raiser Og today from the best delivery service in south orange ca, Blue Bird, and I am impressed by the freshness and aromas wafting up my rather large, ( according to my wife) nostrils.  
The Leafly overview is quite accurate, so I'll move on to the experience I am having.
I ground up two nice little buds for a small solo joint, rolled in one Elements ultra thin rice papers.  Please for...”"

This is some very fine herb. I have a long history of medical marijuana usage, (61 years old, 40+ years of smoking), and have had my medical license since 2002 here in California, thus I have had the good fortune to have been exposed to the finest varieties of medical grade strains in my lifetime, for I try t...”"

I would describe it as an indica dominant hybrid. Similar to Blue Dream; but more heavy on the indica side.”"

Flavors & scents are a sour citrus & woody pine. This 60/40 Hybrid's effects are uplifting, energizing, happy, & relaxing. Protect The Harvest.....”"

bmorekwame,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hell-raiser-og/reviews/1548892,"“This is my favorite strain as I am a neophyte in the medical cannabis world. This will is a great day time sativa. I feel that the effects last about 4 hours maybe more. I can still be myself. Pain is reduced a little. Stress, anxietyb and depression gets quieted down. I say this greatly helps common conditions like the ones I mentioned, though it may not totally eradicate anything. This makes life more manageable wi...”"

Its not super kushy, hits of lemon and musky but a very neutral flavor.  We called this shit Chronic growing up. Almost a perfect mid day picker upper. My flower was grown great, lots of resin and sticky brittle nugs. The cracking sound when I broke it down was something to see and hear.  I think t...”"

Lineage: Fire OG x Face Off OG (Bx1)

What can I say it glistens under the normal flashlight on my iPhone. The Fire OG cutting by OG Raskal had already made a name for itself, so ThaDocta of Archive Seeds bred his Face Off OG with this esteemed specimen to create a next generation of Kush Hybrids. One of the best strains of 2014, hard and heavy caked in trichs! A must have for any veteran.”"
