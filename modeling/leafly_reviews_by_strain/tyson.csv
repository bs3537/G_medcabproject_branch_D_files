john870113,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tyson/reviews/1666885,"“Just got some of this beautiful Indica recently and I am completely in love with it. I know that sounds weird but it's true. I have always been an Indica fan so I have sampled many, but this beats them all by a mile or ten. I have Crohn's disease and Tyson knocks it out cold and makes me feel happy and positive like I am not sick at all. If you need pain relief, appetite stimulation, sleep, muscle relaxation or mood ...”"
