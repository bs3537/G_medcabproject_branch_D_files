Cookie Dough
=============
Beelzebub,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-dough/reviews/1396419,"“I don't usually rate my strains by their experience due to a bunch of reasons. Anyways this cookie dough is absolute fire. If you see it buy. Buy it in bulk please you will not regret your purchase. As somebody with a HUGE tolerance to most flowers I can say this will knock out even the most seasoned cannabis consumer. Stay Stoney my friends (-; also this is a very saliva leaning strain, thus paranoia suffers beware ...”"

HighSeasLoudWaters,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-dough/reviews/1455034,"“What can I say about Cookie Dough? Im high? No, it's needs more. It needs a proper introduction... It's like a fairy grew this strain with her own hands, FUCKING MAGIC! Within ten minutes you begin to fall on a bed of clouds, there is amazing trippy/acid feeling further into the decent from your world to the next. Where do you go from here you ask..? THE KITCHEN to grab yourself a motha loving snack, because the munc...”"

olly5000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-dough/reviews/1416551,"“Hail Mary Jane, hands down one of the strongest strains I have ever smoked, had me walking like a zombie out of the walking dead! Super sweet almost cheesy berry taste, HEAVY mong and giggles that last almost an hour. Cannot go wrong with this strain, especially if you want to get more mashed than the potatoes on a plate of my mothers chicken dinners!!”"
sagetut,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-dough/reviews/1354505,"“Nice GSC cut. We have this here in Michigan & wow! Definitely top shelf meds, a little racy at the start with a bit of paranoid, but if you can wait it out, she will take care of you real well”"

thecoolestchronicallyillnerdyoullnevermeet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-dough/reviews/1547753,"“Beautiful blissful high. Sweet sort of skunk flavour. Tingly sensation throughout, helping melt chronic pain and headache away. Appetite for the first time in months. The mind effect's aren't overwhelming, just right to relax. If I had more I'd be passed out in bed right now, but for now I'm chillen. 1/2 a dab in. My husband loves it too, killed all of his pain instantly. This is a true hybrid with the mind/body effe...”"

DurbanAssassin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-dough/reviews/1392355,"“The force is strong in this one. It hits hard, it hits fast and it hits you everywhere. Even for a veteran like me this strain is overwhelming. Great for getting away from it, but forget any and all notions of productivity.”"
jimmyinspazzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-dough/reviews/1505404,"“So far my favorite of the Cookies ranking equal to the Blueberry Cookies mainly for their taste.  The latter was just super sweet with an edge of skunk, but this Cookie Dough was not so.  Rather bland with a little bite on the tail end which is immediately felt.  With each hit the sensation becomes stronger seeming endless.  Meaning the sky is the limit so if you want to get ripped keep going.

Really keep puffing aw...”"

Had some today before going on a hike, colors were way more colorful- amazingly intense effects. Kind of puts me in a kush hole when it hits but once you get past that it’s incredible.”"
