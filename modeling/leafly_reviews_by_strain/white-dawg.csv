White Dawg

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-dawg/reviews/1394196,"“The White Dawg has to be one of my favorite strains. I can't believe it has such a low rating. This is some of the strongest fire around hands down. It's genetics are OG Raskal's The White x Chem Dawg #3(Tres Dawg). I guess some people don't like good weed, but me, I love it and The White Dawg has to be the strongest out there.”"

WD will get you good and medicated without feeling overly so; you just feel good, up and happy with this chatty girl.
It seems to to have a sharp, pungent smell when heated up and is accompanied by a profound flavor of green pine or even hops.
In short, a great choice for outdoor adventure, urban shenanigans o...”"

Great to ingest in the form of concentrate in a social environment. It lacks the typical spirituality/mindfuck found in higher doses of other sativas, instead gaining more and more euphoria as dosage goes up. My headaches and cramps got totally wiped out, but I did find in higher doses of concentrate I got a bit dizz...”"
kappawolf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-dawg/reviews/1370150,"“First thing about this awesome strain is the euphoria and happiness associated with it. First time smoking this was a wax concentrate and it definitely got me a easy [9.5] but in a good environment I could totally see this as a super good stress reliever. I was finding hilarity in almost anything, like someone had previously stated it took me back to my first smoking days. White Dawg is a perfect hang out strain and ...”"

Sugary in trichomes comparable to Super Lemon Haze, it is the breed of  Chemdawg 4  White Widow. One hell of an upper, I was up and going, talking, and enjoying my strong body and mind high. I combined it after the initial hit with Super Lemon Haze, Chocolope, Dutch Treat and some out of this world Platinum OG x Blue Bream BHO Shatter to achieve a high unknown to mankind b...”"

It's a great euphoric strain, very happy, and upbeat do two or three decent sized dabs, relax and enjoy. I bought this strain knowing almost nothing about it and I'm glad I did this is one of the funnest strains I've smoked in th...”"
twiggn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-dawg/reviews/1274141,"“This stuff is no joke. If you have anything to get done when you smoke it, get it done first. It's an intense couch lock high that hits the head and the body and holds you in place, where ever you may be. But after a few bowls, it just knock you out. For me, it's best for one nice big bowl a couple of hours before bed, maybe a hit or two for a pick me up, but that's it.”"

http://ireadculture.com/2012/12/reviews/strainsofthemonth/white-dawg/

I can't believe it has such a low rating on Leafly.  White Dawg fans gotta step it up!!  This strain is SUPER potent, it says in the article above that it's at 28%!!  So, just be careful with it.  Some people have mentioned paranoia with this one, but I have a theory on Sativa buds and paranoia...”"

Wanderingwolves,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-dawg/reviews/1377118,"“If you wanna feel like a teenager again smoking weed for the first time this is the strain for you. Giggles, munchies and a general whimsy are the main effects. Is very euphoric, however not that preferable for the every day smoker who needs to also function like an adult! Would get again for the joy though.”"
RaiderRod,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-dawg/reviews/1338881,"“Nice euphoric high, great pungent taste.  Nice frosty nugs gives White Dawg it's name. Very good pick me up in the afternoon.  Great for gaming.”"

yamabushi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-dawg/reviews/1329365,"“I humbly amend my previous review of White Dawg. This stuff will send your ass to the moon! Well - two bowls and two 35mg THC suckers will get you properly keyed. Odd thing is, I still stand by my previous review of not getting stoned the first time I tried this. Second time around, hoo boy, different strain altogether. 

Paranoia with this strain, surprisingly, none! And did I get the ULTIMATE litmus test to determi...”"

This can only mean one thing, my tolerance has returned - bummer. As for other pertinents, it tasted pretty good (slighty piney) but very subtle. I'd even go so far as to say it doesn't have much fragrance or taste. That glorious stink is missing, missing! In this case, the terps truly make the plant a...”"

qpjames,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-dawg/reviews/1577008,"“White Dawg is a great "thinking" strain. I find it to be mostly Sativa. It makes me very talkative and creative, with creative ideas for solving problems, etc. just rolling off my tongue! It makes me very happy and safe. I save this one for when I need inspiration for an engineering project or any other technical endeavor.”"

hedpetrev,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-dawg/reviews/1604494,"“Cannot believe the rating. This is one of the most mongy strains there is. It's not for the all day user. More of an evening of weekend. 

Beware of the dry mouth. Thats the major flaw with it. Also I have bipolar and I find the strain well suited for me.”"
Stony_Curtis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-dawg/reviews/1356492,"“I think this is a matter of personal biology, but this strain did NOT agree with me and I spoke to one other person who had the same reaction. If you are someone who has trouble with paranoia or anxiety from meds then steer clear of this. Full disclosure: it was my first time using concentrate so this probably magnified the effects.”"
