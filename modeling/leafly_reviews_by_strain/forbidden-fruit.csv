xtramoist11,https://www.leafly.com/indica/forbidden-fruit/reviews/1467036,"“I got this strain from PALS Collective in Bishop, Ca. and let me tell you... never have I had such a tasty strain. Some may call it cherry or fruity, but it's 100% Grapefruit. It's a very purple bud to the core and chock full of orange calyxes and frosty trichromes. It's beautiful to look at, smell, but treats you even better. An Indica dominant strain, this will make you smile and lose track of time and pain while l...”"

My first impression of this truly Forbidden Fruit was truly exhilarating;

THE SMELL:
 I opened the bag ever so slightly and my roommate (across the two bedroom apartment with her door closed) came out to smell the Fruit; she could smell it through my closed door and hers across the house (and it is easily the BEST SMELLING STRAIN).

Great for: melting into your couch and getting lost in music
Bad for: being even remotely productive or anything social”"

This strain has a very nice citrus cherry flavor and scent. It has a beautiful green color with lots of purple throughout the bud, golden orange hairs, and shimmers with beautiful trichomes. Forbidden Fruit is definitely a crowd pleaser. Be warned, this strain, if grown and stored properly, will knock you on your ass. If you’re planning on do...”"

Strong fruit aroma as soon as I cracked the bag.  Reminds me of the smell of fruit punch with too much sugar.  Tastes very similar... makes me think of what tropical weed should taste like.  This is easily one of my top 5 strains of all time.

Strain that can be so pungent and uniquely so, that people either love it or hate it from what I’ve seen.
