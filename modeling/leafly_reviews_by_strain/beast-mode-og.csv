It's the type of smell that warrants a "close your eyes and inhale".

The overall look is as follows: short yet wide, dense buds that are pale grey in color, yielding plentiful trichomes that can be illu...”"

sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/beast-mode-og/reviews/1554099,"“Got some beast mode og by red label. Doesn’t look that great because it’s outdoor and was on the low shelf. Effects are amazingly strong but not enjoying the speedy thoughts, some tense nerves, and talkativeness in the beginning. What was good was the strong relaxation in body and mind. Mind is calm and happy. Smoke had expanded decently strong during inhale and stayed consistent through exhale. Good long cough. Tast...”"

I peeled myself off of the face of the planet Pluto to write this 

When I first took a hit I felt like someone was drowning in a neon-lit purple pool,

Enjoy the most trippy experience one could desire”"
