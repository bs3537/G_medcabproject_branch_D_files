NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/p-91/reviews/1395458,"“Really nice strain original burst of energy gives way to a nice relaxing body high while still being quite euphoric. The buds are beautiful very dense absolutely covered in trychs. The flavor is kinda sweet and spicy with quite a bit of earthiness thrown in. I really like this strain after work cuz if you smoke a bit too much you won't be getting any work done. Definitely recommend I know Phat Panda sells it under th...”"

First thing I noticed upon looking at this flower was the beautiful vibrant green color, then the frosty resin! The smell is a little citrusy with undertones of sweet almost chemically smell. Breaking the flower up was nice too, with the smells coming out more prominently. Very nice dense nugs with a slightly fluffy appearance. When smoking I instant...”"

We all loved it because of its cerebral effects. Been asking and searching for years now where I might locate this old favorite... betcha Leafly will help ;)”"
nwaustincraig,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/p-91/reviews/1576014,"“The P-91 strain, or “Fuck Yeah” by Phat Panda really exceeded my expectations. I got it in a preroll so I can’t say much about the physical appearance, however smoking this flower really blew me away. It’s a very smooth smoking strain with a very fruity flavor. As some others have mentioned in the reviews, I thought it tasted almost exactly like the “Fruity Pebbles” cereal. For someone like me that works in a rather ...”"

moodlemoodle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/p-91/reviews/1397293,"“I asked for a strain that would take the edge off without couchlock, and I got this. Such a nice mellow high, lasts just a few hours, and no hangover fuzz the next day! Very nice.”"

Saulcc93,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/p-91/reviews/1780884,"“Concentrado de alien, con un sabor un poco a mora, parecido al sabor de los skittles morados.
Me pone en un estado de relajación como para ver películas, jugar videojuegos, escribir con audífonos y buena música pero no para hacer cosas que necesiten intelecto porque me distrae muy fácil el sonido de las cosas de alrededor 
El cuerpo lo siento muy calmado y siento que tengo los ojos un poco cerrados, no me ha dejado p...”"

This Northern lights cross is great for chilling with a cup of coffee in the morning or playing some music. The effect is very balanced and relaxing. Left me daydreaming a bit. The buds are dense and compact; nice deep green coated with electric orange calyxes. The smell reminded me of a Lemon cough drop, lemony with a definite menthol pungency. The flavor was 
unique to say the least. Reminded m...”"
