HighTendenciezzz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/super-g/reviews/1524185,"“This is a pretty solid strain. It's very similar to gorilla glue #4 in my opinion. Has a fuel/diesel smell to it and bit of that gorilla glue scent. Taste is on point with the smell and effects are pretty heavy hitting, this strain isn't for amateurs. Solid strain nonetheless 4/5 would buy again.”"
