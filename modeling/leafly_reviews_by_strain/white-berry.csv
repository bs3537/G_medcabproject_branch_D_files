White Berry

jwashburn1983,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-berry/reviews/1379940,"“This is most definitely the strain for us anxious types. I have this and Love Potion #1 on hand currently, and they are both amazing, but this is the best I've ever smoked for my panic attacks hands down. I was in the throws of my worst panic attack in a long time not a half an hour ago and after one round through my vape, I'm totally level. Don't get me wrong I'm still stressed out, nothing makes reality stop happen...”"

This is one of the most intense body highs I have experienced from any strain that I have tried, but it's quite enjoyable. Your libido will surge into overdrive and you will crave sex.  In large doses it can leave you feeling a bit dizzy but besides that all other attributes are positive.  Less is more when it comes to consumption.  You can always vape o...”"
ShaunCanToke,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-berry/reviews/1332389,"“Bought off my guy as a special deal, told was very dense but very worth the effort. 
He was totally right. It's a laster! Time is lost on this burn and it's a beautiful high.
It's melty. And it goes well with fruit punch. 
All anxiety drifts quietly away and you can just enjoy shit again. 
Final though: it's a warm bath rolled up in whatever memory foam mattresses are made of. 
Fruity”"

It creeped up on me a little, the high came on almost a full minute after a decent sized bong hit. Nonetheless, it tastes and smells awesomely fruity and the bud is nice and frosty. Not one to pass up.”"
NSF,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-berry/reviews/1358422,"“White Berry (or Berry White as my local grower calls it "because it's so smooooth") is a balanced strain.  The buds grow large, dense and frosty, with colas that can get bigger than your arm.  When fully cured, the resinous nugs look white from all the trichome crystals with small patches of orange hairs peeking out.  The smell is very floral and berry-bush-like, though some earthy elements bubble up from the dank un...”"

This relaxing and euphoric indica has swept me off my feet. At first you taste the sweet flowery taste with a smooth hit to the throat. It has a very leafy aroma. I've had a lot of positive effects and even opened up a few people who have had bad experiences with pot. This is really great for anxiety and for a slow easing ...”"

I have suffered with depression and suicide thoughts for years.  One hit and it took my mind to a different place.  Definitely want to get of the chemicals (pill) I have to take everyday for depression.  This is a much better solution to all my issues!”"
nickidoobie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-berry/reviews/1167211,"“One of my favorite strains! Crazy mind journey and euphoria. Great strain to love your mind in and get lost. I'd suggest it got solo dolo nights with some great music. I'd call this the 'spiritually couch locked" strain.”"

ARStewart41,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-berry/reviews/1099002,"“Had an amazing taste that solicited an excited response. Followed by a fast onset of a heavy body high with a huge happy/euphoric element. Talkative, giggly, and enjoyable. Very similar to Blackberry Kush but more clear headed and less buzzy. Had a defined sense of paranoia if in the wrong environment. Still very fun and stress-relieving in the right place.”"

The effects were nice and it smells heavenly.  It wasn't top shelf at the dispensary yet looked more frosty than the top shelf, so I got an 8th from Healing Green Dispensary($28).  Happy with the purchase but I probably wont be buying this strain again...”"
douglashadtopoop,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-berry/reviews/1245923,"“Jesus. Stuff is mean and not at all what I was expecting. It's like a hyper-alert sativa high and a heavy indica head. REAL high. Similar to OG kush, which is not my favorite but is obviously respectable. It's not exactly what I was going for today, but holy hell it is something.”"

Phil_Palazzolo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-berry/reviews/1129594,"“I'd compare it to blue dream but with a kick. 
More Sativa then Indica, detect blueberry notes but also like a pine cream combination. Berry pine smell. 
Very Euphoric, definetly will get rid of a headache if you need it for that but id prefer a straight indica if you need something more for pain.
THis definetly cures anxiety, it gives you dry mouth and can slow you down like a benzo. 
Its a genius hybrid now that i ...”"

So y'all this his girl and honestly I immediately feel at a stand still feel a bit heavy on the body but a relaxed vybe. Lips tingle a bit and eyes heavy. Definitely don't feel as hungry and more of a medicated feel. Great strain!”"
ARTailor8,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-berry/reviews/1348861,"“Definitely a unique terpene profile right on smelling the jar. Upon inspection, the flowers were completely coated in trichomes, had extremely tightly packed calyxes and were some of the densest variety of flower bud I had ever seen up to that point.

Smooth on intake, smooth on exhalation, the complex profile of the, 'White Widow' background comes through while maintaining the sweetness of the distinct, 'Blueberry' ...”"

Great for anxiety and stress, was having a rough day when I got this and had an instant head change, right back to level almost instantly. Says here it's not great for pain, but it has a body high creeper effect, so you get the head change immediately and find your body relaxing after about fifteen minutes. Tastes great too!”"
sativalover,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-berry/reviews/1138455,"“this strain was a big disappointment.  i read the reviews on this site and when i smoked it i was like wtf is this shit..  it did smell very strong and good though.  it was covered in resin and looked like it would be the bomb.  I knew the grower and he said he was very dissappointed in the plant as well.”"
Toker180,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-berry/reviews/1099016,"“I had this strain from a friend of mine and honestly it was probably one of the worst strains I've had. It wasn't grown well so that's maybe why but the effects didn't really kick in as much as I wanted them and note I smoked a whole Blunt almost. So really if I had no effects, didn't really get the after effects either. Overall a 6/10 until I try it from another person.”"
