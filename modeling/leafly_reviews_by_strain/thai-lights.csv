Super heady buzz, great body high and insane strength and quality. I wanna give it 5 stars but compared to other strong strains I really enjoy (GDP, Durban Poison, Mag Mile) this one really dried out my eyes and it didn't really make me hungry, but it made my stomach kinda crampy.

It all felt like a restful heaviness everywhere, like gravity was kicked up a notch. Very pleasant fruity beer aroma to the flower.”"
