It has earthy and sweet undertones but overall it seemed weak especially for a crumble. The mind relaxation is great like a soft blanket hugging your brain. The body sensation is like a light tingle that radiates throughout the body emanating from my core. Pain, depression, stress, and anxiety are all gone. It doesn't help my stomach but I'm pretty satisfied.”"
