ianlhayes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-ultra/reviews/1397169,"“For my first legal dispensary purchase, I wanted to get the most mathematical bang for my buck, so I looked for the best cost-to-THC ratio. 3.5 grams for $30 of 29.7% THC fit that bill easily.
LA Ultra goes straight to my head, like the façade of a building in a silent movie crashing down around my shoulders, but it doesn't knock me out unless I smoke too much of it. Unfortunately, "too much" with this strain can be ...”"

connoisseur99,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-ultra/reviews/1297385,"“The unique and strong smell burns your nose, like spicy pine needles. I vaped this at around 385 and it burned my nose on exhale like a chili pepper. The high hits you like a truck, you may not be able to feel your arms and legs for about 30 minutes. Not a super long lasting high, but very strong and wonderful for kicking you into relaxation. One of my all time favorites after many years of smoking.”"

connoisseur99,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-ultra/reviews/1217188,"“The smell is very aggressive and addicting. Not for beginners, the high will make you grin with excitement. Made my whole body tingle and vibrate. This month I have tried 27 different strains, and was completely blown away by this one. Is this even cannabis?”"
RecWreck,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-ultra/reviews/1230284,"“As I'm typing this, I have the jar to my nose, I can't stop sniffing this! It has a deep piney scent with beautiful citrus/lemon accents. It tastes delicious, especially on a vaporizer, and will leave a lemony basil taste in your mouth. This strain is very relaxing and introspective. Perfect for watching something like the Godfather and noticing all the subtle commentary. Smoked hundreds of strains, and this is one o...”"

dispewt,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-ultra/reviews/1215800,"“The very high CDB level in this strain makes any pain or headache go away and you feel like you're floating. It's got some serious anxiety killing power, too. Not as euphoric as I thought it would be but it still makes me feel very happy and at peace. Great for insomnia, anxiety, pain, and mental well-being.”"
rockandrollem,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-ultra/reviews/1225652,"“Bites the nose, and then, a chemical taste comes during exhale. Some Indicas can hit heavy. However, this is a mild evening high. You stay up for a while, do a few things, and then slip into relaxation🌛.”"
