Superpoop! 
Ultra bubonic chronic! 
Fantastic med values include joint pain relief, stomach related issues relieved, mind relaxed, body floats, hunger increased and as most Indica strains do, induced sleep. 
Overall supreme in regards to its crazy, mixed up flavors. Berry, cherry, chemical twists and this odd, earthy, coffee aftertaste. 
Top shelf bigtime!”"

It often has a rotten fruit smell. Often taste fruity with hash undertones. An extremely potent strain!! Seeds can be found at Neptune seed bank.”"
grinchgrinder,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-magic-kush/reviews/1376543,"“Delicious and beautiful buds. Dark green leaves mixed with lighter dense areas and plenty of orange brown hairs. Smells of earth and berries. Tastes like spiced berries and a bit of clove. Effect is indica-dominant; relaxing and sleep-inducing.”"
Melaper0,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-magic-kush/reviews/1369757,"“A relief, this strain. Perfect for stress, PTSD, anxiety. And a good night of sleep. No pain, just euphoria with still a clear mind. Bought it at Pot Cargo, good buds, satisfied so far.”"

A dominant taste of rose petals via vaping.  Something I have never experienced.   If you have read my past reviews,  you would know that I don't get super excited very often.”"

I sure hope there is a grower out their reviewing this strain and would do the whole state the honor of ensuring this chocolate flavored mountain trip get's toked on the regular! You can even stack Black Magic Kush with a God or Goddess Bud type or variant of your choice, but ...”"
