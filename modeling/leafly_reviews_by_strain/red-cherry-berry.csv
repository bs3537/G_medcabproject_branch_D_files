Red Cherry Berry
=============
SativaCaribou,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1375130,"“I combusted .3 grams of Health For Life cultivated Red Cherry Berry in a glass pipe with an iso-butane lighter. The high was slow starting at first but crept along nicely into a even high between my body and my head. Within the initial 10 minutes anxiety was washed away, I was quite relaxed and grew a smile that's stayed on my face for the past hour or so. There was moderate pain relief but the more severe, chronic p...”"

MrGdubvee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1200420,"“Not very pungent, but has a smooth earthy taste. After two puffs you can feel it hit you. Within 3-5 minutes you feel very relaxed and at ease. great for stress relief and anxiety. I literally felt as if I had taken a xanax.”"
Catsnkush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1306821,"“This strain is possibly the best to smoke when in a group, or when blazing up with friends. Your first hit, you're immediately struken with a throat hit because of the high THC content and flavours reminiscent of berries. This high makes you extremely giggly, chatty and completely out of your mind. If you're looking for a new strain to smoke up with your friends, this is it. 10/10 my favourite strain (and I've tried ...”"

neulovimie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1245545,"“Pretty good strain, definitely above average. Very relaxing and creative, good to listen to some music or play a guitar. Hopefully, will have a good sleep too. 

Hit a bong, smoke a blunt and enjoy.”"
David2Goliath,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1063450,"“Overall a solid daytime strain.”"
miguelLSM,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1383052,"“This strain made me feel like i was floating on a cloud. And made me superrrrr giggly, i couldnt stop laughing. It took me about 10 minutes just to send a simple text to one of my friend becuase i couldnt stop laughing. But other than that, it took my mind off all the stress life throws at me and made me so happy.”"
Econirvana1995,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1232835,"“I think This weed is great.I felt it's trip just after few puffs and trust me this was a best high I had for a while. While it made my body relaxed it also hit my brains. I had an amazIng sleep afterwards.”"
The_Green_Ambassador,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1692082,"“Absolute fire i managed to pick up in Amsterdam 2016 - Green Place! One of the most pleasurable smokes you will have! Subtle tangy berry kick with a 'best friend' high! This will never get the praise or exposure it needs, grab it if you can, I'll never forget my man RCB!”"
JohnnySativa420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1202500,"“It was pretty good. Not a big buzz but smooth.”"
Wrangler307,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1310021,"“Cherry Berry helped with nervousness. It's certainly an after-work strain for those who must remain especially lucid during the day. Worth noting: it has a delicious fragrance and subtle berry note that is a nice little treat at the end of the day. Doesn't give you couch-lock, but, calms nerves subtly like a low-dose Xanax.”"
beansie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1144453,"“Plants have great yields - bushy beyond belief and flowers everywhere.  Vapes nicely - smooth, slightly delayed effect.  Strong effect but difficult to overdo it.  Instant relaxation, sleepy after a couple of hours.  Comfortable, more cerebral than body - no couch riding.”"
hcazrellim,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1252874,"“A solid 4, no more. Recent snow last night made packing snow cubes in the bong a great high. Appreciation of nature and a run of happiness on your climb to the top. Not at all a harsh smoke (as compared to bubbalicious). Solid B+ / A-”"
LorDoza,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1272753,"“Subtle hints of fruit and sweetness embody this strain, but with an overall earthiness and smooth exhale that is mild on the throat. Exhales remind me of cotton candy, and the sedative effects are mind-numbing. Smoke a bowl, then just sit outside on a nice day. Nothing better than taking in the beauty. Red Cherry Berry is a 4.5/5 in my books. Solid hybrid, and definitely one to try👌🏼”"

Mcaveman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1471862,"“Strong head high but also relaxes the body, kinda gives you both a indica and sativa feeling.”"
JohnnyLemonhead,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1233627,"“Lovely uplifted high. Nice mix of head and body, never flirts with couchlock or squirrelly anxiety. Hits gently and rewards patience, but doesn't overwhelm when you indulge. Calm, fun and in the moment.”"
DancerDJ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1152925,"“I felt nothing. At. All. My friend said it helped with her headache, stimulated appetite and helped a lot with body pain/inflammation (she is on dialysis and has a host of health issues) AND she was able to be functional in getting tasks done which she was excited about!”"

DanceFloor3000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1132538,"“Extremely underrated. Stumbling along a strain such as this should be an opportunity never passed up by any medical or recreational smoker. When grown the right way; The effects should be mild and perfect. It can really change moods for the better, also the taste is playful.”"
jvkeizer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-cherry-berry/reviews/1284548,"“Bought this at Amnesia in Amsterdam. It was one of their cheaper strains, but it said that it is a strong indica. And hell it was a strong indica. It knocked 4 of us out for about 5 hours I think. It was a really nice and relaxing high and definitely the best weed I've had as a Dutchie, so I would 100% recommend it to anyone looking for a chill and relaxed high.”"
