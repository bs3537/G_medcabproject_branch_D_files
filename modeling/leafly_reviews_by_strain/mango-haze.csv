Nice tingly indica undertone, barely noticeable which I prefer if any indica is present. Watch out when you sit down though, she can take you away to dream land if you let your mind escape, depending on what you want of course! As a recreational smoker, this strain is truly fun and beautiful with...”"

One of my personal favorite strains, definitely noticeable mango aroma & smell, but only if you brake the buds up.
This sativa dominant strain should be used imo at daytime for best results.
Do's & Dont's :
-Do use for anything that involves strategic thinking, physical activities & group interaction.
-Do use before sunset. 
-Do not use before you go to sleep as it might keep you awake, feeling...”"

I was still able to function, which is always nice when trying to manage a life when you're in chronic constant pain.  Again, a great recommendation by Cannabis Nation of Seaside, OR.”"

JD3RR,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mango-haze/reviews/1416564,"“First off, the strain tastes amazing using a vaporizer. It amazes me how closely the taste resembles that of a true mango!

In my opinion, I'd have to say that although this is advertised as being a "day-time" strain. It seems to cause me to be relaxed and lack of motivation, but does not per say cause me to feel a need to sleep. I'd say this is the perfect "Sunday Strain". Good for a relaxing day of stress relief.”"

The buds have a very strong mango aura and are very dense. Generally will be sold in smaller dense buds over one large bud.
