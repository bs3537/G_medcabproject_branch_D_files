Shmoogalooga,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-crack/reviews/1356696,"“I picked this up at Altitude Organic Medicine in Colorado Springs. The aroma is earthy, becoming pleasently sweet and floral when ground up.  Impressively smooth on the intake and friendly on the bronchials. One can easily take gnarly bong rips like a champ with this strain. I have to say this is some of the best am weed I've come across in a while. It's a little less racy than the G.C. but still clean and clear head...”"
jasminaaxo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-crack/reviews/1385562,"“This high felt so different from all the other highs I've experienced. It tastes great and it made me beyond relaxed I felt like I was on a cloud. I normally have a really high tolerance with weed but this strain got me high as fuck on the first hit; Highly recommended!”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-crack/reviews/1393795,"“Purples consistently give the best mood elevation and it holds true here with a really fun come on. Brightens and clears out the head wonderfully. Opposite of a cloudy / stupefying high. Top marks for mood elevation - it really lifts spirits with strong euphoria. Makes socializing easy and fun. There is a slight raciness in the background. A rare combo of a solid feel-good high with clear-mindedness.”"

sativacyborg66,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-crack/reviews/1389131,"“Very euphoric and bouncy. Makes me very talkative. Completely destroys anxiety and depression. Medium green buds with purple spots covered in crystal. The taste is a sweet, grape or fig like berry taste. Thick and easy smoke. Definitely a new favorite of mine. On a side note, from what I've noticed it also serves as a fun and energetic aphrodisiac.”"

OVORupert,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-crack/reviews/1334679,"“I picked up an 8th of this from my dispensary and if give it a 3.3, it made me dazed and I want thinking straight.  it wasn't like the regular "I can't think straight", it felt more like constant confusion. I'm not saying I wouldn't smoke it again, definitely not running back though”"

dankmas,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-crack/reviews/1334066,"“Tastes really good, the smoke isn't harsh at all. Trippy as fuck, has the focusing effects of a Sativa and the relaxing buzz of an Indica. I like to do smoke this when I've had a stressful day and I still have to get some work done. Downside is it gives you dry mouth and slight paranoia.”"

It was dark purple and brittle as hell. I would definitely buy it again.”"

MurfDog19,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-crack/reviews/1232604,"“Not at all what I was expecting, which is a good thing. I was expecting a racy, heart pounding sativa, but the effects were quite relaxing. The smell is a mix of familiar dank aroma and a peppery spice. The taste is very peppery, which turned me off. Overall it's a decent strain, but not one that I'm interested in buying again.”"
Weed.Friendly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-crack/reviews/1270009,"“This strain is definitely in my top 10. Such a great taste, but the buds are also just beautiful! Big fluffy nugs! The high left me nice and energetic but also had me max relaxin. Purely an awesome strain!”"

VLAD81,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-crack/reviews/1361417,"“Well for me when I tried it I thought I would be super high but I wasn't,I was more relaxed and awake then anything. I gotta get some more of this,plus I would mix it with some Reggz and Sour Diesel, what I always call making a salad.
