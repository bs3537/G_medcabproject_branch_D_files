Dutchberry
=============
NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutchberry/reviews/1383404,"“I definitely consider this top shelf bud when grown by Artizen. This is a great Sativa hybrid plenty of energy and focus mixed in with a little overall body relaxation and some pressure behind the eyes. The buds look absolutely amazing they're dense and frosty to the extreme also quite sticky and resinous. It smells sweet and citrus and when a put some in a grinder it is extremely pungent and skunky (like really good...”"
littlewitchystonerkitten,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutchberry/reviews/1397085,"“As a long standing, deep-rooted cannabis enthusiast I find myself looking for three things when purchasing bud: a Sativa-dominant Hybrid, a THC content of at least 20%, and a good recommendation. When my favourite budtender, Dave, at Greenside Recreational in Des Moines, WA recommended this hybrid that met all my requirements, I knew I had to try it.

Spoiler Alert: I was not disappointed.

And in my opinion this is phenomenal bud. By far the best sativa leaning hybrid I've ever smoked period. Very nice uplift. No anxiety ( and I used be on 4mg of klonopin a day) happy, giggly, actually enjoyed shopping with my wife and that says a lot LOL. Very relaxing but still able to pull focus and then ...”"

lowpass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutchberry/reviews/1296390,"“Live in Colorado, bought this strain in WA. It is great. sweet, intense high. dont smoke very much for results. and it isn't the dried out CO stuff I get. reminds me of when I lived on the wet coast.”"
BrainPain,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutchberry/reviews/1366066,"“First thing that hit me when I opened the bag was the smell. OMG! Amazing! Budtender at Kushmart suggested this one to me and it is a hit. It smells as amazing as it tastes. Keeps the smell and taste after the grind and right through the vape. 

High is a creeper, but not quite as bad as straight Dutch Treat. It's a light high with a hint of euphoria. There is a lot of head high with some body high. For me, DT has al...”"

Not mutch of an appetite, but I could lick a few lids of mustard, or multi-decaduish tamari. Tingly-berry, I'd name this strain if I could. Very berry, silly, tweaky, bounc-ey even. I'd love to steal at 6" cutting, you know.”"
JennRox,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutchberry/reviews/1330050,"“I normally aim for high cbd strains, but this one is wonderful. It takes you to a happy, good place. It can make you a bit chatty and tastes quite good as far as smoking it, so it can be good to use with friends. I know it was awarded dope cup's people's choice and I can see why. Only setback is it does give you slight dry mouth and low eyes. I feel it's absolutely perfect for getting stuff done around the house-it k...”"
dcorn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutchberry/reviews/1388285,"“This strain is amazing relaxing and uplifting almost immediately.Its earthy on the inhale and has a strong berry taste on the exhale and aftertaste.Effects are mainly sativa but it can be used to calm down before sleeping.Smell is pungent and fruity very fitting to the strain itself, this is now one of my favorite strains and I would reccomend it for a calm day or for anyone with muscle pain.”"
beverlymoonrise,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutchberry/reviews/1529734,"“I have an overall pleasant time with this strain, though I think its a touch too heavy for me. Some moments of anxiety during my high, I think it wants me to access my vulnerablities and is gentle when I access them—which is good work, but not always what I’m looking for in a high. Its relaxing after effects linger long and heavy making me feel very drowsy so I prefer smoking it before bedtime or when I’m not hoping ...”"

As an anxiety sufferer, I highly recommend this strain for anxiety relief. Although the effects are more sativa-like in terms of being "up", it relaxed my mind...it gives a happy high.

Almost too easy to select when you discover the lineage: DJ short blueberry and Dutch treat.  I mean what the hell? How do I resist that?
I’m usually an indica kind of guy, but Dutch berry hits my sativa craving without giving me the sativa anxiety thing.  Happy, cerebral, fun daytime smoke.  I slept like a rock with it, but for sleep there are much better strains in my opinion.”"

I typically stick to Indicas because I have anxiety issues that are usually worsened by Sativas, but Dutchberry stuck out to me so I gave it a shot. I must have smoked too fast because it hit me, HARD. Super flustered, anxious and paranoid. Be cautious with this one if you already have anxiety.”"
infinidro,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutchberry/reviews/1289557,"“Just like the description says, this was the perfect strain to smoke at the end of a productive day.

Great taste, great smoke, great effects. A+”"
