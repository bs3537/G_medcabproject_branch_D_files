I have been searching for a good daytime flower that is not more than 50% sativa and that works well for my issues and I have found it!

Less couch-lock than a strain that is 60% Indica 40% Sativa, rather than 50/50. I think the fact that it's a 50/50 strain makes it absolutely perfect. It's a perfect balance.
