BowenIsland,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/astroboy/reviews/1583413,"“This strain is like no other.  I like daytime sativas that provide a more clear headed high and there is no better one than this. Astroboy has a very light and pleasant citrus taste and smell. It has a strong and uplifting high that will hit you quickly and last a few hours.

ghosttropics,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/astroboy/reviews/1280641,"“just a perfect daytime strain. Like a less racey super silver haze, this provides an amazingly uplifting high that, although strong, is perfectly clear headed, making it perfect for getting stuff done, or just focusing on a good book.

rockymountainremedies2370,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/astroboy/reviews/1339062,"“Strong high that will keep you active while relaxing pressure and tension in your head. Alert and meditative, this strain may benefit depression, PTSD and lack of energy. Also, may be helpful for migraines and anxiety.”"

Great smoke and flavor with a mental clarity  and energy that is second to none. I don't agree with the high paranoia rating, just not my experience.”"
