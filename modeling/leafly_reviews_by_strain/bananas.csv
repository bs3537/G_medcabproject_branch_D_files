PERFECTLY BALANCED HYBRID !!!

Offers a very EUPHORIC and FUN MIND & BODY HIGH ! 
with no noticeable uncomfortableness 

Use ANYTIME on days off &
AFTER WORK on days you work
Not recommended as a wake and bake because it is very relaxing and you won't want to work LMAO. 

Most Hybrids claim a 50/50 I/S or close % and allege it will help with muscle relaxation via it's Indica side but ...”"

The taste is very sharp at first and spicy but rolls around to the smell and the flavor of great tasting herb- made me very happy. This wasn't as dry as the other strain and ground up to some fokkin beauty!”"
MedicalIncredible,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bananas/reviews/1270581,"“Snoop does it again!
Dense buds with skunky and fruity smell 
Does not smell like Bananas 

The buds are pointy like Bananas.
Lots of Trichomes 
Yummy”"
Scribzilla,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bananas/reviews/1346103,"“This strain is fairly complex, the inhale definitely has hints of tropical banana while the exhale has hints of ammonia. Don't smoke to much thinking it's not working.. this strain will creep on you fast, especially when you get up to go get the Cheetos.”"

Rayal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bananas/reviews/1708591,"“Actually feel high off small amount. Doesn’t help with headache. Causes mild anxiety, but likely just because of strength.”"

sparty121,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bananas/reviews/1609302,"“I really enjoy the full-body relaxation I get from this strain. I have muscle spasms and TMJ syndrome and I felt like my muscles were slowly melting into butter. I felt clear-headed but a bit paranoid with major cotton mouth. I would recommend as a bedtime strain.”"

f42flicks,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bananas/reviews/1331025,"“Im reviewing this bananas and cream crumble from "tru|med" in Phoenix and it is truly truly dank. Honestly one of the 20 best concentrates I have ever used in my life. The high is klean enough to remain funktional with a high level of fokus. At the same time something for the end of the day to relax, wind down from pain, etc.... Truly an all around great strain. A definite must try.”"

I haven't gotten high in forever, so I was a little paranoid at first. This strain legit taste like banana's which I wasn't really expecting. I asked the budtender if she's had these before and she said yes and that it won't give you much of a cough. This was all true! The only thing is to be careful how much you take in if you're a ...”"
