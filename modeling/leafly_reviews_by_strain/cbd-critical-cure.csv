CBD Critical
=============
KristiiNicole,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-cure/reviews/1416441,"“This is by far the absolute best strain I have come across. I had long been searching for a strain that would help with my anxiety AND depression. This was particularly difficult since I have a sensitivity to higher THC strains (they make me MORE anxious). This strain is absolutely incredible. It's got a fantastic body high, a fairly mild head high, the high CBD helps it be a little less 'heady'. Also, I read another...”"

I had 4 little tokes off my pipe after work last night and found it tasty in a sour tea earthy sort of way. I was surprised that this low THC , high CBD strain also gave me an immediate euphoric response. Happy, talkative and relaxed with just enough pain relief....Ahhh that's so nice! ...And I slept through the night... Bonus Star!!!
I tried a small two tokes before work this morning and found...”"
gorgegirl11,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-cure/reviews/1412101,"“Absolutely LOVE! 💚💚💚👍 
This particular plant from Mtn View Naturals is 10% CBD and 5% THC, which for me is the perfect pain releiving ratio! 
It just wraps up all my pain in a soft blanket while helping me feel relaxed but not loopy.
This is now my favorite CBD strain.”"

I am mentally unwell. I do not have departed souls within me, I have my minds manner of coping with loss. I have had a life that is not light on tragedy. Marijuana is medicine 💚 and will help me make age 💯💚☯️💚”"

All the strains I tried were too intense and not really enjoyable.  After doing a little research, I acquired Critical Cure, as it is a low THC high CBD strain. THC 8.9% & CBD 14%

Excellent results!

Experience: Very mellow, hyper awareness without anxiety.  Slight ...”"

Taste was strong indica, like Darkstar. Earthy.”"
rene57,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-cure/reviews/1378668,"“Very pungent aroma, to me it simply smells sweet, piney with a Citrus smell and taste. Smells like a knoll fern Christmas tree with fruits. Ratio is excellent 8 to 5, 8 being CBD! It really helps with fibromyalgia pain and swelling. A Super comfortable and mild smoke. The best for patients that need real medicine with a  lite indica feel to it.”"

saalah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-cure/reviews/1367966,"“This strain easily replaced Cannatonic as my go-to CBD heavy strain. I find that it's more 'high' than Cannatonic without increasing the potential for anxiety at all. Great for pain reduction as well -- it works on my sciatica as well as pain from sports injuries.”"
dogeatweedworld,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-cure/reviews/1394508,"“This is now my favorite smoke!!!

I can smoke any amount anytime and a flood of relaxation washes down my body. I love the flavor as well. 

I also find it alters my high of other cultivars that I smoke. If I smoke or dab too much and feel a little racer, this will have an instant calming effect.”"

I may have a slipped disc in my lower back. This strain stops the pain and gave me a calm, chill head mental state and a warm, relaxed body high. Gives me a break from the chronic pain. Love this strain.”"
TheToastedToker420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-cure/reviews/1255201,"“Great strain. Absolutely rids my Gerd and any inflammatory pain. Easy smooth smoke from quite dense nugget. I strongly agree that this strain presents an earthy yet sweet aroma. Currently smoking a phenotype that is dark green, yet has a hairy forest of long, clustered dark amber pistils, covering over 90% of the bud!”"

ultrapop,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-cure/reviews/1334883,"“this was either 10 or 12$ a gram and seems worth it's price considering it is a kush strain, which i view just a grade higher 'in price than other strains like hybrids. Nice marble side flowers which when ground down gave off a heavy gas/diesel scent. Very smooth thin exhale smoke, i feel this is great to mix with something stronger. Love the high CBD % on this”"

First of all its one of best tasting strains I ever tried.. Its literally like smoking roses or Grandmas potpurri😃.

I'm very impressed by its already present growth potential, about 1/2" a day under a 2000 lumen LED. This strain is putting out a high 15% CBD, and 12% THC, purchased from Green Degree out of Wasilla, Alaska. Looking forward to updating Leaffly in 3 months with flowering pictures.”"

Has a sweet taste similar to hay or sweetgrass so can be nice to mix with other tastier strains.  Blue Dragon, sativa dominant is a good mixer because of strong blueberry dessert taste which seems to level off the overwhelming sedative effect of Ccu.

I tried some Critical Cure for the first time, and almost immediately the pain went away. My muscles were able to relax and I no longer felt the tension and irritability that my pain was causing. It has a nice flavor: pretty mild, earthy with a hint of a frankincense-like aroma, and just a mild touch of diesel. I think I'll be able to sleep now....”"
