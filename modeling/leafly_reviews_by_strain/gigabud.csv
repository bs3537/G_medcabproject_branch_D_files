BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1392664,"“Giga provided me with a completely clear head and a fair amount muscle relaxation.  Pleasant tasting enough spices, and herbal.  Smells a little sweet but didn't carry over into the flavor profile for me.  I enjoyed this strain but it's not super strong.  Nice one to lay down too.  8/10”"
StivaGreen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1389498,"“One of the most powerfully helpful new strains I have met in a long, long time. This strain is amazingly effective for treatment of my digestive organ damage (as well as treating my susceptibility to pancreatic cancer). I am malnourished and this strain is literally helping me stay alive by helping me to eat. Very exceptional.”"
StivaGreen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1389499,"“Easily one of the VERY BEST strains I have ever tried for chronic severe pain, insomnia, and weight-loss/appetite for digestive organ damage and malnutrition.!

Absolutely the best/most helpful used to date in last 3-years.”"
SinnerD,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1389501,"“I'm a medical grower for a family member suffering from gastrointestinal disorder(s), as well as two other patients that suffer from chronic pain and muscle spasms. So, I'm always looking for an all around good strain. However, I've had my moments where I needed to hurry up and get some clones to keep the cycles going, keeping patients medication harvested on-time, monthly. 
I got this strain, Gigabud, from a medical...”"

Taurus58,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1358179,"“It is the BEST I have ever had.  It is a Total Body High.. Relaxing, Mellow, Calming, Long Lasting and MOST IMPORTANTLY is makes me HUNGRY.   I DONATE to Medical Strains.  
I have been trying to locate a list a Medical Strains  that MAKE YOU HUNGRY with no success.    I DO NOT have an APPETITE..  I am 69 years young.”"
babachman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1717066,"“Exactly what I was looking for to help me fall asleep. Took a little while for the feelings to settle in but once they did.. wow. My whole body is relaxed. This is a very potent body high which melts me into my bed with pleasant thoughts, and my thoughts aren’t too racy so it’s easy to fall asleep.”"
tristan....,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1358183,"“Great strain! Easy to grow(big harvests, from the big bud), heavy indica effects provided by northern lights and other indicas depending on the seed breeding company. , the colors are darker greens, dark purples, bright red hairs. Has a very earthy and berry aroma to it. The taste of the northern lights slightly can be detected in some batched, particularly organic grows.”"
i_miss_u_cupcake,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1322847,"“I was just a little disappointed that this strain did not turn me into Giga-Bowser like I was expecting. It's just kinda giga-bulls**t, ya know. All I got to experience was a relaxing and sedating effect that relieved me of all stresses. My entire body and mind calmed. Mellowed out. Peaceful. A true delight to unwind with at the end of the day, especially while listening to breathtakingly beautiful music. But dammit,...”"
Dank74,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1534430,"“Strong smell but very good and smooth. Tasty. I would recommend for sure.”"

Lifechanger043,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1626472,"“Planting all five of my seeds turned out to be a head ache when it came to “predicting” the final weeks of flower and knowing when to flush. These autos start and finish on their own time so I have one that matured at 73. Two more left and I think there’s anywhere between 1-4 weeks left. That’s 12-16 weeks. Better off to go with a regular you know when the flower process starts. 

Major lose is the time I’ve been flu...”"
Arizontnightmare,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1696224,"“I really like this strain. I’m not much for real heavy indices but this was the bomb. It slowly creeps on you and settles in nicely. You feel happy, relaxed and sleepy. You can comprehend most things, but definitely a bedtime strain. Not too overwhelming!”"
ReFurr,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1673178,"“This strain left our whole group giggling & looking at each other cross-eyed. Non of us had been that stoned in a while, it was great!”"
Urban-Alien,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1786997,"“im quite dubious of Autos as ive had a couple of clangers and a couple of ok-good strains mainly from Barneys Farm.. Ive done Dutch Passions Auto blackberry Kush and found the quality to be good-very good though they took upto 90 days to finish even though they say 70 but this G13 Labs Auto Giga Bud has took the top spot in my rankings at the moment with its huge buds, wonderful crystal covering, varied aromas and fl...”"
DannyVibes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1382998,"“This is a great non productive sleepy strain. It's fruity flavors give it a great taste. Smoke it up and prepare yourself for the munchies. After you gobble up the grub expect to lay down and pass out. Wake up alert and ready to go or go ahead and repeat.”"
MqtGuy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1150040,"“I have been growing in this strain for years. One a my biggest producers and one of my patients favorites.”"
srcruz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1498570,"“Very clean head stone. I felt like being on the move, but would get lost in thought and had to snap out of it a couple times. A nice and positive high could be a strain for those suffering from depression.”"
highsam97,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1596239,"“Surprisingly heady for an indica, but oh boy does it knock you out. I'll be on the couch for the rest of the night. This would be great for lighting up with friends and laying back to watch movies and eat shitty food.”"
DireWolfDave,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1146754,"“Great fruity taste. A breeze to grow. Very resinous.”"

Jared4204,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1376719,"“Highly sedative, makes you wanna eat everything too (:”"
kymani420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1282082,"“Personal experiences contradict what is stated above.
Very heady high, but is long-lasting.  Don't expect to be able to go to sleep as mind will be racing; very thought provoking. 

When coming down will not just have muchies but be ravenous.”"
TheMindHunter,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1452550,"“Great strain for those days where you are telling yourself you "need a drink when you get home". Very mellowing feeling with slight physical "vibes" flowing. Definitely reminiscent of 60's stoner hippy mellow.”"
5alarmfire,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1369849,"“Great outdoor strain”"
crpowell312,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1183783,"“This strain is a cross with White Widow. Very Similair look and taste to white widow. The high is very potent and long lasting. Lasted well over two hours. It burns pretty quick but at the same time hits hard. The high is very relaxing but it does not tire me out or put me on couch lock. Overall a great strain, awesome for anxiety. The only downside is I noticed after smoking a huge bowl three hours later I had a hea...”"
hieseherr,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1358178,"“The Gigabud is a hybrid from G13 labs that packs an extreme sativa high not to be played with.  The high is somewhat deceiving as it comes on slow and is purely visual.  Don't look for any body high.  This stain will take you higher.  Very spacey high that will leave you confused and looking for your keys.  Don't do anything.  This high is best for an attitude change without any sedative qualities.  Purely head high ...”"
nickvango,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gigabud/reviews/1344062,"“I have this strain.  It isn't a 60 day strain as Leafly relates, nor is it a super fast flowering strain as many other websites claim.  If you take it down before 11 weeks, it's too early.  Many other strains which claim 7 or 8 or even 9 weeks are not even close.  The pics here for many strains are complete fabrications of who knows what strain. Most strain pics do NOT show the strain in question. It's true.”"
