Wonka's
=============
Easy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wonka-s-bubbilicious/reviews/1383696,"“This brand new strain called Wonka’s Bubblicious looks as intriguing as it sounds.  The buds are very well manicured spears that are light green with a metallic hue.  The hairs on this bud are very distinctive and range from dark red to platinum blond.  This bud is covered in trichs that are small and very compact.

This is definitely a candy for adults in need.  This bud is very fun to look at and not overly resin...”"

This is by far my all time strain of cannabis. The perfect balance for my personal needs of sativa and indica. God bless you horticulture father Wonka's Bubbalicious, God Bless Him/Her!”"
jimmybh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wonka-s-bubbilicious/reviews/1080255,"“Just tried this and had to review it! Craziest smell, taste and high I have had in years. Smells of well yes, bubble gum but there is some other mix of berry and subtle musk, but I can't put my nose on it. The taste is equally as alluring but also equally pleasing and does change over the period of 5-10 minutes. It just lingers and lingers on your palette and keeps changing! Wonkalicious! The high compliments both th...”"

Whilst smoking it, the flavor changed which was an interesting experience. So if your out for something different, this is well worth picking up. Great taste and an even better high”"
Deitab,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wonka-s-bubbilicious/reviews/1316218,"“Wonka's Bubblicious is very strong hitting.  Took about 10 minutes to kick in, but MAN!  Once it did, the world was alright.  It was a tad freaky to taste the different flavors in this bud; first kinda bubble gum, then flowery, then sort of tart.... a real treat if you get the chance to get your hands on this, don't pass it up.  Look at the average review ratings; highest I've seen on Leafly”"

Expensive a little but well worth it. Flavor was changing and just sooo yummy. Guess that's why they call it 'Wonka's' bubblicious.



Reminded me of the complex nature of Girl Scout Cookies. Love these new diverse super strains! Keep it up breeders!

Effects are strong and take effect very quickly... a couple of puffs and I'm off to the races.  The batch I got was particularly fresh, burns a nice long time, lots of bang for your buck.”"

TheFamilyStoner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wonka-s-bubbilicious/reviews/1361155,"“I was intrigued by the name of this strain, so I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did!

The nugs are so frosty there's kief left in the very top part of my grinder when all the bud's gone through. Like, a large enough amount to absolutely cover a couple of bowls in, just from grinding a couple bowl's worth! 

Wonka's Bubblicious smells like grapes, bubblegum and candy. So yummy. It's a nice light white-green ...”"
teresamu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wonka-s-bubbilicious/reviews/1080248,"“Love this new strain I found in San Francisco when I was visiting. Organic, covered in crystals and the smell and taste are out of this world. Mouth watering and the taste changes, just like Wwonkas gum. I highly recommend as this is one of the best new strains I have tried since Girl Scout Cookies. Was delivered in a nice glass jar by delivery service sbj organics. Gotta love San Francisco!

Luke7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wonka-s-bubbilicious/reviews/1268424,"“This is an excellent strain. It's an uppity high and if I'm standing around I get a bit restless. I don't consider myself a functional daytime stoner (smoke mostly for insomnia), but I can definitely accomplish things on this. It also doesn't give me the munchies, like at all. Well, maybe a little hungry if I haven't eaten, but no craving if I have. The high only lasts me about an 1.5-2 hours. Great daytime strain, a...”"

I couldn't wait to smoke it. When I did the high was on level with the smell. Just amazing all around medicine! Very euphori...”"
