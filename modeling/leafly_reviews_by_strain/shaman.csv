Good for hard working, like car fixing etc.

As i mentioned Shaman budds give you lot of energy without significant infuence of  side effects.”"

Purple is not usually one of my favorite mothers, while I call Skunk my best "giggle weed," often so silly I'm almost stupid (back to the second grade).  This hybrid though is different than either.  It has some of the elevating effects I'm used to with Skunk, but without the "stupid" aspect--instead I feel creative,...”"
zezcentix,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1152519,"“This strain is one of my absolute favorites. It was my very first bud, this is a very nostalgic thing to smoke for me, I usually look around and think to past times smoking, look through some of my old art. But within an hour and a half of smoking it, I will definitely be making something, sculpting, painting or drawing(once I even made a ridiculous DIY bong because it REALLY brought me back to my early smoking). I g...”"
970toker,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1136904,"“This strain is a great daytime smoke.  The nugs are dense with purple leaves.  The smell is very citrus/flowery and taste great in a vape.  It gives a very happy uplifting high that doesn't give you any couch-lock.”"
EnjoysAnyWeed,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1169402,"“Some pleasing purple bud from People's Choice Wellness Center.
Smell and taste is of a citric berry swirl that I find only in purple buds.
The high is a pleaser with a definite "stoned" feeling that lets you calmly connect with whatever you please - yourself, your surroundings, your loved ones, whatever.”"
KeanuReefer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1133036,"“I bought this from a very well established dispensary in San Francisco, CA. Everything is tested for %'s, clean and safe. However I did not like this strain that much personally. It was far too clear headed, to the point that after the short euphoric burst of 20-30 minutes I didn't even feel high anymore. This would be a great sativa for someone with low tolerance that desires the more visual effects of marijuana vs ...”"
HighCee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1352126,"“Picked this up in Steamboat, CO. Absolutely loved this one. Felt euphoric and motivated. Great day smoking weed and great for joints!! Probably my new favorite strain.”"
barnumspex,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1061176,"“Incredibly uplifting. Great for outdoor use while hangin' with some friends. Colors are endlessly satisfying”"
bobboc24,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1352128,"“Great sativa. Good body high too. Euphoric and creative cerebral effects with slight tingle. Very relaxing and no paranoia. Amazing purple buds, giving off an immense fruity/flower aroma.  This definitely is my favorite purple bud that happens to be sativa.”"
alteredmindset,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1588307,"“This is a strain that is a lot stronger than I thought,estimated around 14%. Personally I had this strain over thirty years ago, this is the original purple skunk. I grew this myself and I have to say that this strain does purple, some more so than others, I have three plants at 4 and half foot tall. They are bushy and an indoor grow, the smell is not strong, the flavor tastes like hard candies which is nice, the smo...”"
ajuk2k,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1226739,"“Very distinct taste ! It's pretty flowery with a bit of spice. This stuff was extremely heady and gives you a tiny body high as well. These boat times are too spicy for the pepper.”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1191988,"“Overall I found it to be a very pleasant sativa high with just enough indica to relax. Shaman is a good name for this blend, good deep thought and relaxation.”"
DJKidd925,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1163319,"“Shaman (in Concentrate form) is by far a great, great strain for not only veterans of the concentrate field, but beginners as well. I usually burn through a half g of Shatter, or crumble in a day. I've had this stuff for six days and counting, and have a half g left. Last night I smoked out two fellow patients but first timers dabbing, and they both said they had never been this medicated before. (this is off one hit...”"
r3b3lgrower,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1061177,"“This was my first purple strain, the smoke was a lil' skunky, beautiful mixed green and purple bud presentation, nice amount trichomes! Shaman made for superb daytime medication, a great one to get things done!”"

RastaJosh,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1061178,"“Smokes smooth and well. Coming from someone fascinated with Shamanism, this is a wonderful herb. I smoked a Sativa dominate hybrid Shaman, with deep purple nugs. I normally prefer Indicas more but this is strain is wonderful.”"
Dave1987,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1253477,"“This strain gives a nice energy kick and has a good amount of positive upbeat emotions. Would be an excellent anti-depressant strain ! More mental than body effects. The high starts very activating/energizing and  later tranfers into a heavy couchlock. Did not make me tired.”"
Bart8888,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1744368,"“Had this 24 years ago. All the Purple strains from Dutch Passion strike me as very well-balanced as none of them have ever caused me any anxiety paranoia. Highly recommend for the beautiful flowery taste and smell. When you have this it really feels natural and healthy. The effects are very mellow. Not suitable if you want to have an ultra-potent high as it will be difficult to achieve with this.  Very functional str...”"
AOTA,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1318750,"“This is one of three strains I grew on my first run in 04'. I was told 90% sativa and it grew short and bushy with dense flowers like an indica. I smoked it for months and enjoyed the lemony sweet uplifting effects daily. I grew 12 from seed in 3 gallon pots next to a bed of Mango and one giant HOG Wreck in a 15gal on the side of the room. Check that. The fourth strain was a few Somangos to fill things out.”"

trichromebeard,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/shaman/reviews/1243596,"“Great heady strain. Old school with a unforgetable flavor/smell profile Had a purple aroma and tasted much like a red table wine. Not overly potent but puts you in the right place to transcend consciousness and enhance the senses.”"
