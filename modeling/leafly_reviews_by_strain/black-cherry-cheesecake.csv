HerbeHeureuse,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1379752,"“Today getting baked on an empty stomach vaping Black Cherry Cheesecake, a cartridge by C02.  Not sure what I think of the C02 brand yet, but so far I like the feel and taste of the Select Strains cartridges better.  CO2's tip is plastic and has a plastic looking encasement, and I think it is giving the vapors a plasticky taste.  The Select Strains brand has what looks to be a metal or ceramic tip, which is why I feel...”"

Ice storm, rainy day, love life troubles... if you are down because of that thing, and you're like me, Black Cherry Cheesecake will lift you. That said, it'll take it's sweet cheese-cakey time doing so. Bcc is a creeper that keeps creeping, kind of like one of those junky old carnival rides that takes you through a haunted house that's more funny than scary. ?? Yep, that kind of rid...”"
sweetbutter80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1350930,"“This may be my fav strain to date. Kinda forget pain/nausea scale when I medicated round 2330? Takes 5-10 min to start working. Pain nausea gone. NO ANXIETY/PARANOIA (a must). Head buzz smooth & mellow. Def a worker bud but can go to sleep also after medicating. Body high dang near perfect. Tastes like cherry coke to me (yum).  High lasts for a few hours' longest lasting since I got my card last 9/2013. Very highly r...”"

jjnugs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1272139,"“I heard this strain was a cross of legendary genetics.,Black cherry soda, UK Cheese and Super Silver Haze. It definitely lives up to the parents. Amazing colors, fruity smell with a cheese undertone and a soaring high of SSH with a nice body stone. Very euphoric. This strain has it all and really relieved my anxiety better than most I've tried. A+++”"
DarleneSmith,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1372465,"“I think the best strain yet. Very good high but yet I can clearly focus. It also caused arousal for my husband and I which is another plus.”"
Stunnie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1380754,"“This strain has a sweet potent aroma and it has a bold sweet berry taste as well. The appearance of the strain is overall purple and it gives you a huge body high, but you are fairly focused.”"

connorw,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1370206,"“Low-key one of the better strains out there, no doubt. Flavor and smell is great, and high is solid. Relaxing and sedative, but definitely able to focus and think. Great stuff.”"
HoneyBadger2830,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1373566,"“The best strain I've ever had. For some reason my friend and I thought it actually tasted like black cherry cheesecake. yummm”"
trixxi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1362823,"“This is a good tasting strain, it burns nicely and the inhaled smoke is pleasant. I am not sure I agree with the description as the bud that I smoked did not have that much fruity taste or purple color or red hairs, but it was still very pleasant to smoke and nice aromatic aftertaste. The effects are more alert than totally relaxing, a true hybrid blend of Indica and Sativa. To me this strain beckons to be rolled in ...”"
StonedReviews,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1253737,"“Beautifully colored bud with dark purple and light green leaves with vibrant orange hairs. Good head high. Sweet in flavor with earthy tones when exhaling. Not as strong as expected given it's deep purple color.”"
anguskhan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1772744,"“Seems like most agree on here that this is a pretty perfect hybrid, 70/30 i believe is the stat and it shows in the smoking for sure. Someone said it tasted bad. They obviously got a bunk version since the taste is one of the high points of this strain with it's sweet berry-like taste with a hint of cheesiness.

RAGEOWL,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1277286,"“when I tried this strain it had small little purple nugs with a sweet sweet smell it definitely had sativa properties when I smoked it, it hit me right behind my eyes instantly relieving all pressure behind my eyes (I didn't know I had pressure build up) then waves of euphoria with burst of energy I really like this strain (got it from wildwest growers southern oregon)”"

Skyhon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1661464,"“This strain is the best thing ever since sliced bread. Got a nice head high, not too intense like Silvertip where it rushes to your head and not too slow like Mega Jackpot. It was right in the middle and that was exactly what I was looking for.
Ate a whole box of Oreos after taking three hits off a preroll I bought from Lucid. Halfway through, I had the genius idea of putting Milka chocolate in the cookie. Blew my mi...”"

OGBudbrother,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1369493,"“Nice buds... but maybe mine was different. Very bright... super stanky cheese smell with the underlying sweetness. 

Light green buds,  light orange almost yellowish hairs covered in trichomes.  

Had it curing in the jar and still... little dusty. little tickly on the throat. High wasn't anything noteworthy.. did the job. Kinda short buzz.”"

highsam97,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1557315,"“Absolutely beautiful, the most deep purple bud I've ever seen. Sweet smell and smoke. Very relaxing and creative high -- the couchlock grows on you, but it's still a very mental strain; everything seems to flow. I expected a knockout indica when I saw the color, but it's a slow, calm, functional strain.”"
IndiGiGi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-cheesecake/reviews/1798762,"“This is my all time favorite strain. I suffer with depression and anxiety and this is the perfect high. It makes me relaxed and soo happy and giggly. After a hit i find myself cracking jokes, googleing how ketchup is made and makes sex mind blowing which is a miracle for us depression suffers. The perfect strain 10/10”"

The gorgeous bouquet is a feast for the nose, while the colors are reminiscent of those found within cherry pie. Flowers are deeply reddish-hued/cherry-red in parts and covered with lemon-yellow crystals. The trichomes are deeply honey-amber in color, nearly the caramel color of pie crust.

I used to search for this strain on Leafly back when I first started getting this stuff shipped from Oregon over a year ago, never found a thread.
