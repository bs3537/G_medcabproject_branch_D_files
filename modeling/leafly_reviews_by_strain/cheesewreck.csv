nickidoobie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheesewreck/reviews/1382060,"“I need to find more of this stuff! I'm definitely wrecked right now as cheesy as that sounds. Super connected and energetically wavy. Love the sativa, great strain for social situations with great friends.”"

Melody1390,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheesewreck/reviews/1357721,"“Tried this for the first time tonight and was very happy with it. 
Medium density, sticky buds with a strong, very dank smell.
A bit of a creeping up high for me but very relaxing and calming. The tail end of the high really helped with my insomnia.

Negatives: It did give me dry mouth worse than some other hybrids but other than that no negative effects for me.”"
smokiepie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheesewreck/reviews/1355360,"“Smell is amazing. Buds look great. Unfortunately, this one made me anxious and paranoid. Next time, I will mix it with 30% Sour Tsunami to tame it down a little”"

leafybuddah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheesewreck/reviews/1394719,"“Love cheese!

Pungent smell of feet just like cheese it produces a distinct aroma with a sweet and earthy notes.  As I mentioned being a fan of cheese I can say that U.K. Cheese and cheese #1 weren't as enjoyable or as potent as this nice hybrid of train wreck and cheese. Will definitely smoke again as long as it's available also would recommend Blue Cheese strain for those who enjoyed it as much as I.”"
surfgavin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheesewreck/reviews/1498364,"“Awesome strain, perfect blend of indica and sativa effects. I consumed using a nice Cheeswreck wax and and hit right away with the trainwreck-y sativa side while the Cheese indica rolls in after a little to calm it all down. Flavor is great, my pheno leans a bit towards the lemon from the trainwreck, but does have a flavorful cheese-y exhale. Medical properties are great, is apatite stimulating and relieves aches and...”"

winchaben,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheesewreck/reviews/1160276,"“Great Smoke! Nice taste, but a little rough inhale. Has a very pungent aroma and taste. The high starts out with with an aware, talkative state, then it mellows into a dizzy, sleepy state. A nice smoke if you're home with friends.”"

For me though I feel good, chill, vibey, music sounds better, I suck at Xbox now though lol.

KushDessert,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheesewreck/reviews/1127881,"“Floratec(h) Nutrients, This strain grew like a Sativa with Indica influences, leaves started off wide like an Indica but later when switched to flowering, began too spread and thin out.

This strain loves to feed and if left without for about  week it will show quick signs of Nitrogen def. So pay attention to your feeding schedule and how it's doing.

The high isn't overwhelming whatsoever but depending on how yo...”"

Tastes great, and gives you that heady, fun body buzz you're looking for when you're doing hiking or biking. This isn't the stuff you spark up when you're looking to unwind, but definitely more for socializing and working out.”"

It also has some pretty decent arousing effects of you're with your partner. Nice bud to keep you awake but eventually helps you wind down. Had no problem driving and it eliminated my elbow pain.
