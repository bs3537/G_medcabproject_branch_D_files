Aereanna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1414404,"“💚THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE, FAVORITE, FAVORITEEEE STRAIN!!! 💚

I can not say enough good things about this strain. It is so smooth and tastes great. It smells citrusy with a tiny pungent smell at the end. 
It is so good for EVERYTHING!  It helps with my anxiety and depression mostly and then secondly it helps with my pain and insomnia. Even though it's Indica Dominate, I don't feel the lock from it. I am still a...”"
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1378770,"“A superior strain.  Perfect for winding down in the evening...and you can stay awake.  You will be very relaxed...add a dash of euphoria...put on that music....and.....aaahhhhh.  Bliss.”"
litpineknots,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1414370,"“It gets you pretty ripped. More resistant to powdery mildew than some. A classic looking hybrid with a tendency to form monster colas if unpruned. You can take it as early as 6 weeks sog style,  more like 8 weeks on big fuckers. Doesn't like outdoors much. THC  22-25%.”"
Detroit420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1384655,"“fabulous taste and used huge trichomes👍 great for pain and severe anxiety looks a lot like Margo's Gorilla Glue number 4”"
thcbaby,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1382750,"“Probably my new favorite strain. Great head high followed by a very intense but still chill body high. You might get pretty bad cotton mouth and a reaaaally heightened sex drive. Really dank and worth it.”"
oni_booba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1382748,"“Fantastic. Not an overwhelming high experience, no matter how much you smoke you never get obliterated - but for anxiety, wake and bake, or any daily activity C4 is supreme! The only downside is that I smoked it so much faster than any other weed I've had because I could literally be high all day and couldn't get enough of the euphoric yet somehow stress free and energetic effects.”"
Browdie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1382747,"“i have CRPD (chronic regional pain disorder) so i am in constant pain from the top of my neck down to my finger tips in my right hand. the pills prescribed to me only help so much but this strain provides some relief on the nerve pain. im not a pot smoker because i get overly paranoid but this strain does bot have that effect on me. the taste is ehhh and the smell is strong. i would definitely recommend to someone wi...”"
greenthumbmassohio,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1269541,"“Already had a buzz from a different strain.

simplyjuhnet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1382746,"“got this c4 from Pisos in Las Vegas. came from pepperlane cultivator's. High in caryophyllene so it's got a spice but the not too much. the limonene in it calms that spice. The hit was good you can taste that spice. make me cough. the high is a head relaxed and able to focus. in tune. tried it in the bowl and and small joint. loved it. it's very fluffy and moisten​. the smell is nice! pines and lemony!”"
originaladrian,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1382749,"“picked up from Tempe wellness. decent bud however I was really not a fan of how this tasted when smoked. medicinal effects were decent however its not up there enough on the intensity to call top shelf. the smell is more on the citrus and Haze side and the taste is of citrus first then gasoline and chemicals.”"
nbarefoot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1356104,"“Consistently the largest nugs I have probably ever seen my dispensary produce. Has a potent but not overwhelming earthy, pine taste and is the optimum strain for treating my anxiety.”"
sneer002,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1244413,"“good for wake n bake”"
IncogNeato,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1356105,"“Beautiful buds full of crystals.  Great taste and clean hits, not too thick and "chokey"... Relaxing and wont put you right fo sleep but I still prefer this as an evening strain.”"

ahmni,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1353541,"“The middle of the road for me. Balanced in mind and body, uplifting and relaxing. I turn to C4 when I don't need dominant indica or sativa effect.”"
Jeremy0000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1382755,"“This strain bkew my mind. I'm a daily smoker, but this one still had me sinking into the couch with the most pleasant buzz. A fair strain for fighting muscular pain.”"
barkda08,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1353543,"“Had to try at Eugreen because the buds looked so nice, and this strain was fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone who uses cannabis for medicine or recreation.”"
puddlian,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1382752,"“Though I like the effects - not wild about the taste. That's why my overall is 3 stars.  I have depression and I find that this is helpful if I feel myself getting down. Doesn't make my silly, just a little more positive about 'stuff'.  I can still go about my day and have a little more motivation to go outside.  I'll use again, but wish it tasted better - not fond of the chemicalness.”"

C4-OG was the name on label and from all the research it seems to be the same flower.  After sleeping for about 3 hours I awoke exhausted yet wide awake punching my pillow for the past 4 or 5 nights had been similar.  Rough, patchy sleep has been an on and off pattern my whole life for a plethora of different reaso...”"

L1NT,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1323876,"“Mostly I like to get high at nite mostly. the cotton candy seemingly tames the shiskaberry upfront but then the shiskaberry reappears like it never went anywhere.  And I don't even smoke weed, infrequently at least.  Very thoughtful and pleasant thangs to my thangs.  Ty Michigan.”"

Andrus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1244414,"“I would like to report on the taste, but I was coughing too much to taste it, every single hit.  Otherwise, this C4 that I got from L'Eagle brought on an unexpectedly Intense buzz.  It messed with my awareness a bit but I just rolled with it and after a while I went into a pretty relaxed state. Good stuff if you want an intense high, but I wouldn't do this stuff at times when a lot of awareness is required. I would f...”"

AnorexicDiabetic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1664730,"“All of the flavor profiles I love most filled into a beautiful, dense nugget. A great choice for anyone that loves citrus or pine. This stain is currently in my top 10.

It may be an Indica heavy hybrid, but I didn't notice any overwhelming couchlock or sleepiness.

I got this strain at Oregon Cannabis Outlet on Willamette Street in Eugene, Or.”"
slipknot4783,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1504004,"“THE BEST STRAIN EVER. it doesn’t taste like shit and it gets you really stoned after the first few hits, it has quite a few tri-combs and you can smell the strain from a mile away. So far after using this strain i dont have any complaints about it and I recommend this strain to people with depression, anxiety, and nerve problems.”"

BannedG33K,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/c4/reviews/1244416,"“Super relaxing and markedly uplifting. Not a particularly introspective strain, but will certainly help motivate you and assist in prioritizing; which is paradoxical, considering the mellowing effect this flower gives.

One noticeable characteristic is the face-numbing effect that seems to come on almost instantly after smoking. Overall this flower lends a pleasant experience without overwhelming sedative effects.”"
