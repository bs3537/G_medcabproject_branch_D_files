silasbotwin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-power/reviews/1418726,"“Bright green with heavy crystallization on the outside, break open the nugs to discover the dark blue and purple hues that unlock a very pungent berry aroma. Very sweet and thick smoke, taste of Chem-like properties such as a sharp chemical smell with some sugar tipped aromas that accompany berry, cheese, earthy and sour notes. The taste is just as complex, a plethora of tantalizing terpenes make this strain a connoi...”"

I'm high on it now after a few tokes. smoked it earlier and grubbed down a handful of some sweet baked ham sandwiches. those shits were handled swiftly. just like the blue power I am adding them to my menu. this weed makes you relaxed. I reserve it fo...”"

I've enjoyed my fair share of finely grown cannabis in my short time here in WA and I gotta say that FIRELINE has done a bang-up job with this flower. It's the perfect complement to the end of a long day or for just relaxing around the house on the weekend. The body high is the most enjoyable part. The Blue Power won't judge you for taking it e...”"

(The Info page's description of it's "2nd variation" better describes my experience but the 1st mentions it's special aroma and boy howdy is the aroma extra unusual, but I'm assuming that LivWell has created a "3rd variation" maybe by crossing both variations who knows 

Dense Beautiful Buds
Drowning in YELLOWISH crystals 

Unusual Aroma is none other than that of FRANKINCENSE !!!!!

Amazingly fragrant, rich, sweet blueberries in beautiful indica hybrid form. This is an absolutely amazing strain for a true connoisseur. 
Very vibrant, trichome heavy buds with a beautiful blueish purple hue and fuzzy bright orange hairs.

Hendertucky,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-power/reviews/1382309,"“My goodness! This was a great strain. It creeps just a little bit. It does not hit you like a truck. Head change came on nice and slow. Very euphoric, happy feeling. My entire body just relaxed. But not couch locked. The flavor to me was more diesel but an after taste of blueberry. This would be great for pain anyone that gets anxiety or paranoia. The initial head change lasted 25 minutes and then wore off after 2 ho...”"

I HIGHLY recommend trying this out in flower form. After smoking it, I was in a really good mood and wasn't too tired. I definitely felt mellowed out, but with the anxiety relief that this strain provided I had a burst of creative energy and enjoyed some music and even got some work done on my laptop. Blue Power relieved my underlying chroni...”"

I was intrigued, as it is otherwise not available locally.  I'm giving it five stars for the wonderful and complex burst of fruit and flower that strikes both the nose and the tastebuds. Very smooth smoking out of my modestly sized kettle bong. I want to throw this caveat out though - despite being an indica, this strain d...”"

It doesn't feel like a heavy indica~ which can be very nice ! 
This wasn't as sticky as some other varieties I tried previously by BaM.  But still a winner 😎👍🏼”"

I decided to try this to help with anxiety that's part of the panic disorder that I have. Other indica-dominant strains have been helpful but I was looking for something with less THC to take earlier in the day, so I picked this up at my local dispensary.  Their THC reading came in at about 12%.

cannachris46,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-power/reviews/1256314,"“This is a solid indica strain, reminds me of a strain my friends grow in Cali, practically the only strain they will smoke and make wax from. I really enjoy the smell, and it's smoke tastes very close to what you can smell. I like it at nighttime but not because it puts me to sleep, mainly because it's relaxing. I like feeling relaxed anytime so I enjoy it during the day as well.”"

hjennifer00,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-power/reviews/1334000,"“This strain smells so good! Cracked it open and the citrus/ purple aroma is compelling!

Tastes just as sweet and heavy.

If you want a good sleepy bud this is a good one but can cause headache and severe cotton mouth. I enjoyed it but it was just to heavy for my taste.”"
Caliman22,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-power/reviews/1622384,"“Not bad, not great version of "Blue Power" by Body and Mind. Nice mid grade smoke; initial berry, then bitter gas, then earthy finish. Didnt smell great, a pungent chemical like smell, lacked the THC dusting of a punchy bud, and had no hints of purple or blue hue,  but all in all a solid value smoke for night vibes around $13 a gram.”"
