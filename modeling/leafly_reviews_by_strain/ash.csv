The bud I got was very dense, yet unfortunately sticky which made it difficult to grind up.  The first puff I had was quite harsh as I began to become accustomed to it, and so could recognise the haze linage. As I continued to sm...”"

The only thing is the dispensary I got it from said it was sativa dominant, but I guess it can depend on the seeds and the grow, but its great!”"

Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ash/reviews/1183541,"“It smells of all kinds of different fruits, and very leafy bud dark green and very medium thick branches can go many different ways nice colas! I could classify this as a very nice indica dominant strain great for night time use only you will feel tired and very relaxed not to mention lots of dry mouth. I've found it treats a wide range that can help everyone give it a try! Beware of its spacey features!”"

OG Kush looking bud wreaks of lemon lime reminds me of Lemon Thai Kush. Nice Pungent Flowery taste no skunk very fresh and small nuggets. Love it for its care free attitude and livening up your position where you are right now an absolute oldie but a goodie would recommend for anyone looking for a hard stony feel uplifting happy and motivation with...”"

Leafy leaves and more like a tree branch this bud displays bud structure similar to  G 13 Haze.  The taste of this is very pungent and skunk like I would say bring a water bottle as you will get choked up on this strain it provides a very heavy body high and relaxes me nicely.  It's good for fibromyalgia and allows me to breathe deeper so it's go...”"

The bud that I got was very dense, yet unfortunately sticky which made it hard to grind up. It was also hard to break up which made me resort to peeling it off the stem if you will.

Its an absolute great blast from the past recommended for those who struggle with anorexia, massive pain, glaucoma and most importantly mood & pms disorders. I have a hard time just getting through the average day and even on good days I still fee...”"

Small nugs with dark leavs and dark orange hairs looks like a jack the ripper of Jesus looking buds not as dank but still super powerful can't even see through the other side of this vaped bag. The taste I would say it's woody pungent and at the end chemical and herbal like. Would recommend this heavy hybrid for those later in the day it does provide a rela...”"
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ash/reviews/1369305,"“I love how skunky and rich this s. The skunk and tea pungent aroma and taste send me on a sleepy spiral. I don't know why but when I vape at 186C i get sleepy 190 is energized "shrug" needed it for sleep and I can feel it on the back of my skull and my eyes getting heavy. Really thick vape aught to do the trick thanks ash for putting me to sleep when I need you most you come through :D”"
