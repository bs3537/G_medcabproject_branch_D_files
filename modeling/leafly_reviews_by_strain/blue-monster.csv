connor_ruh,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-monster/reviews/1367924,"“The connect had a couple lbs of this before leaving for the holidays so I grabbed 2oz's of this new (to me) strain. Little more on the dense side, nice smell of chemically blueberries. Burns slow in the bowl and has long lasting medical effects. A wandering mind and sleepy body make this a light day time, or night strain”"
