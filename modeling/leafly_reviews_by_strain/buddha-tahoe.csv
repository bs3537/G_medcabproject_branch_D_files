seanzy84,https://www.leafly.com/indica/buddha-tahoe/reviews/1415585,"“Buddha Tahoe OG from R. Greenleaf organics, Inc. tested at 23.69%THC and 0.15%CBD. very nice tasting, reminds me of chem dog in taste. smooth on inhale and a bit hard on exhale. very nice head high more so than body. smells piney skunky and chem smelling. very nice hybrid and wud definitely recommend if u come across a good batch.”"
aclarec,https://www.leafly.com/indica/buddha-tahoe/reviews/1415587,"“I've had this strain many times now and it is one of my favorites. Although it's more of an indica the high feels almost like a sativa high, but you can still feel that real nice body high. Helps me keep focus which is hard to find in a good indica. Has a really earthy smell and you can taste the citrus just so slightly. smokes really nice especially rolled up 👌”"
mikep1701,https://www.leafly.com/indica/buddha-tahoe/reviews/1413680,"“I'm no veteran smoker or anything but this strain, damn...

One hit and 5 minutes later I'm relaxed, chatty, laughing. I felt high but not *high* like I didn't know what was going on or what I was saying didn't feel like it took an hour to say.

Had a peaceful inner feeling too. Like, "just be", y'know?

Best yet, for me anyway!”"

Yayyap001,https://www.leafly.com/indica/buddha-tahoe/reviews/1336119,"“Buddha Tahoe is a well balanced, tasty, and fun strain. It has a delightfully fresh smell, and has a very complex flavor when inhaled. I noted a very strong banana flavor and hints of citrus. Buddha Tahoe burns well, and creates thick clouds of billowy smoke. I am not a heavily seasoned smoker, and this strain totally took me to a different dimension. The high was very relaxing, bubbly, and peaceful. This strain also...”"

Buddha gives me the hard hitting coughs that bring out the full in hale for my asthma as it allows me to breath. A wondrous whole body effect of pain numbing.

Flavor was ok i would give it a 4 out of 10.  High was pretty decent i would give it an 8/10.  I liked the high but i thought the flavor was too weak.  I would not try this version from Bangs again.

It doesn't get me very high but being able to hang out with people without getting flustered or angry is awesome. Buddha Tahoe is a game changer for me. I also suffer from PTSD but haven't had any issues for a whole week since I started smoking this strain! No anxiety or panic attacks either. 10/10 A+ :)”"

It’s excellent for double-shifters and insomniacs wanting to have some downtime before going to bed.  It has the combination of uplifting and relaxing effects on the body which will put a smile on anyone’s face. Partake with ease unless you want to take a shortcut to nirvana.”"

It's a long pickup but it will leave you couch-locked and relaxed. Definitely will make you sleepy if you take too much!

Buds smell of earth and pine and smoke is very citrusy, almost of sweet lemonade. Very tasty.”"

I was hoping for something to lull me into total relaxation and asleep, but the highly-introspective cerebral journey it took me on kept me awake until I came down and switched to a different indica.

Jbaby007,https://www.leafly.com/indica/buddha-tahoe/reviews/1657182,"“Very nice Indica strain. This isn't a very heavy body high, more so cerebral high but not like a sativa. I only smoke indicas. Buddha lifted me out of my depression and relaxed my tension and stress. It has made me more giggly and overall positive. Also has given me the munchies. Not a whole lot of dry mouth or dry eyes. I don't get any anxiety. Very nice strain. Just wish there was much more body high.”"
