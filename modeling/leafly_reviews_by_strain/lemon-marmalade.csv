The.Avid.Dabber,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-marmalade/reviews/1265365,"“Lemon Marmalade is a powerful, citrus flavored hybrid. The buds are caked with sugary trichomes and have a piney kush scent when broken up. The high is uplifting yet not racy or anxious. It levels out into a calming mellow. Definitely one of the best new strains I've tried in a while.”"

Powerful medical values! 
Sensational breeding! 
Overall top shelf experience included space head high with my mind drifting all over the place. Pleasant pulses of serenity passed throughout my body and I was relaxed. Joint pain reduced to a background noise. Creativity ensued as I ended up delving into drawing, a perfect juxtaposition for my mind and body. I wrapp...”"

Lemon marmalade, sounds good but the rest is better to best.
One of my favorites. Favorite one right now. Wow. Pungent diesel, eucalyptus, lemon, and earthy tones like various exotic wood. The smell preludes a myriad of grandiose effects like euphoria, happiness, creativity, relaxation, zoning, and an appetite. 

Two thumbs up.”"
FiggyPirate,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-marmalade/reviews/1340583,"“One of the best. Euphoria, hightened sensuality, giggly and happy. Munchies galore though, so beware. I can feel my lungs expanding in my body and my limbs are tingly.”"

I had a friend introduce me to help with anxiety and it took me over a year to find it again. This is my go to daily strain. Keeps me focused enough to get stuff done during the day but it also doesn’t get me so energized I can’t sleep at night. 

So happy to find it back in my area!”"

Problem is I can't find it anywhere in the Lis Angeles basin. I'd drive a hundred miles for an ounce of the real Lemon Marmalade. Anyone know where to get it? Please let me know. I'll even buy an 1/8 for anyone able to assist me.
