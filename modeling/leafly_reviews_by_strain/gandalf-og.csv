Gandalf OG
=============
Kirstin31,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gandalf-og/reviews/1369164,"“I just started using this strain for bedtime and let me say... it's been a life saver! I have horrible insomnia plus epilepsy if I don't get enough sleep. I have used well over 25mg melatonin and sleeping pills with no luck, then I found Gandalf.  Definitely will be keeping this on hand 👍🏻”"

Bought some from a dispensary I drive 45 miles to, just because I get twice the amount for my money and they're the only one I ever seen carry it. First time I bought it just because ( a quarter ) went home and rolled a fat joint. Damn, I should have bought more, I could tell after 4 hits. I looked it up on Leafly and on the review chart, ALL the ratings were in the ...”"

etphonehome15,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gandalf-og/reviews/1462009,"“This strain is rightly named "Gandalf" and yells, "You Shall Not Pass!" to insomnia. It also kicks the hell out of anxiety and physical pain. I'm already on my fourth eighth of it this month, and I will probably buy it until it runs out of stock. :)”"

sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gandalf-og/reviews/1459607,"“I really like sedative strains. Can't say Gandalf is my favorite but I would get it again especially if I'm having trouble sleeping. Bud colors range from neon green to neon purple tight popcorn like with moderate amber trich. Very small and minimal orange hairs. Smells like berries and hash. Effects in mind are like a powerful old sleepy wizard. Smiles*... yawn*. From the very super smooth smoke that would make for ...”"

This is a great strain and if you too have awful upstairs neighbors then pick it up, it will help you catch some zzzzzz's”"

Sticky as hell...your going to need a grinder..The flavors of aroma also matches the exhale, a big plus for me. Don't know about my coughee bros but I felt happy and focused. Another citrus pine flavored og for the books.”"

I would say proceed with caution as this strain is a very heavy hitter and will set you back! at first I found the high to be heady like you have been hit in the face by a Mack truck then moved towards a very sedating couch lock type high. very nice dense buds that bust up nice in the grinder,...”"

My excitement builds as the well packed oven heats up and produces scents reminiscent of walking into a dispensary stocked with top shelf ganja. I take 3 rips and exhale clouds of vapor the size of an Oklahoma twister into the air overhead. The smell was strong because I immediately got several head turns f...”"

kronballer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gandalf-og/reviews/1375244,"“Totally Awsome. I love all the OG's, of which there are many. But this one comes with a almost super natural terpene profile. One could be forgiven when tasting it for the first time and almost being skeptical of how tasty it is. But it's a natural taste totally unique amongst connasuer hybrids. Also powerful. Like all OG should be.”"
