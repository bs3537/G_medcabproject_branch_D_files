Fruity Chronic
=============
IandI,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1417010,"“If you want a strain that's social and talkative without being a Sativa, FCJ is five stars. For pain or sleep, it's a 3.5 to 4. It's kind of strange because it's an Indica so while it makes you chatty and words easy to find (which is strange for any strain!), it's also sedation. So, if you don't mind nodding off in mid sentence with friends during Scrabble, it's a good one. Didn't give us the munchies which was good....”"

GTHigh,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1372913,"“The first time I tried this strain was towards the end of a long day not running on much sleep. It provided a full body high accompanied with with a euphoric calmness, yet somehow clearheadedness. It did not make me "couched" or pass out soon after, but instead a more comfortable where you are but willing to go somewhere feeling. I would highly recommend this as an end of a long smoke, or one before a movie or going ...”"
SweetJ138,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1387535,"“I loved it.  would get  it again for sure.  I got a 8th from The Chronic Corner in detroit.   I felt the sativa-ish effects, similar to that of white widow (one of my caregivers mainstays) right away, but it quickly mellowed out to that "super heavy behind the eyes",  calm.   Worth a try if you like a nice med/heavy hybrid.”"
Puffalo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1538095,"“FCJ relaxes the body and gives a nice, mellow heady high.  It’s perfect for cooking dinner, doing laundry  and relaxing at home in the evening. I fall asleep nicely with this strain too.  And it’s perfect for playing Chess too.”"
Tastesogood,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1274186,"“Great high. Nice buds. Tasty. You can Taste and feel the white widow's effects in this strain. Was a little better then average indica's I've tasted and tried. Great tasting.”"

Josh1057,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1273757,"“This stuff guys. It's strong. Using it for anxiety and it works great. Starts out really strong, and then fades to a good level of effects that are very manageable, and stays there for a long time. I didn't stop feeling it for at least 2-3 hours”"
Bradman301,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1310693,"“Great strain to smoke before bed or just to chill and play some ps4”"
Byrdman420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1419685,"“Amazing indica strain. It looks great very, coated with trichomes, taste and smell is sublet, very smooth. The high is amazing, very strong, very energetic and talkative at first then settles into a strong indica”"

Makes TV better, and video games turn in to real life. I can hear the neighborhood dogs barking from outside, and every car that passes by as well. I feel safe, but on the look out for any strange activities. Oh yeah i have a card to do this legally now. Haha. Cool.”"
beeLove80,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1388466,"“First time trying this one. I suffer from chronic pain, anxiety and insomnia. Being a bit of a skeptic, I went ahead and packed my one hitter 4 times. I am gonna sleep good tonight! Pain is at zero, I'm definitely feeling the munchies, no anxiety and a goofy smile on my face. I'm relatively clear headed but just feel fantastic. Cheers!”"
Stan102,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1221740,"“Great strain that relaxes you but doesn't make you fall asleep. It's really nice if you just need to chill and get away for a while.”"
appalachianjane,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1301655,"“The only strain I ever grew that came down with black mold. saved one plant. Decent smoke and wish I had not lost one plant. Fruity with a good body buzz. If you need something to relax with, this is a decent choice. I like better though. Papaya is a better strain and I've never had a plant go bad on me.”"
fitdr,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1319250,"“it's an excellent novelty strain...plenty of flavor and smell that's against the norm..an easy choice when you want to impress people that are new to high grade or learning to appreciate this wonderful plant...most certainly the " burning bush" that Moses burnt at MT Sinai was of this variety...”"
GettinHighSince95,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1209652,"“This is an excellent hybrid with very relaxing and euphoric effects.  Worked very well after work winding down without making me fall asleep. I could smell the ww with a hint of citrus.  Very pungent when squeezed. Taste a little hashy kinda burned my throat. I will try this strain again, although  with a different grower.”"

gwaupogxd,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1306216,"“this strain is good and it smells good as well. It didn't make me talk until like an hour afterwards and when i was done with it i was talking a lot to random people. i was also sooo relaxed at the same time, and listening to music made it so much better.”"
Moosemetz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1619633,"“Resenting picked up some of this from my local dispensary that I'm a trimmer for. This stuff is my new favorite strain. I personally prefer indicas for there relaxation. Not only does Fruity Chronic Juice relaxing it's a very happy relaxed... But that's just me. This strain is very very leafy as a raw cannabis bud but relatively easy to trim”"
bluedesertrose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1795762,"“I tried to strain on my birthday because of the name basically. It also smelt very fruity with a little bit of Earth in it. And they being an Indica strain gives you a little bit of energy for your a little bit more chatty. My personal experience is it helps my mental issues that I have as well as pain and definitely helps my depression. Now I know those of you were going to say pain there's no CBD in it. This may be...”"

So, my partner and I grabbed an eighth of Fruity Chronic, smoked a bunch, went to a park. I honestly didn't even feel all that high until we packed up into the car to drive home... 25 mph felt like 80! It was blowing my mind!

Anyone who is familiar with white window will definitly recognize this right away. It comes on very strong and for me the feeling lasted quite awhile. This stain is great if you want to get to know your couch a bit better because you are going to be there for awhile.”"
ctalbot72,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fruity-chronic-juice/reviews/1320881,"“Great strain. My personal grower. To start it smells delicious, citrus hints like grapefruit, great red hairs dancing around the snow caped mountains. A good smoke, burns real good. Buzz is I think a social high... you can just chill or it's good for a pre-sleep aid. Great beginner bud. Great strain for pain and nausea”"
