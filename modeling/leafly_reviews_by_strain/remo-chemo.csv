Just like its UBC parent you get Excellent Pain and Nausea med. I found this to be much more uplifting than the much heavier UBC, in fact it left me happy, giggling at everything, and talkative. It was too good not to share.”"
Sheepsblood,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/remo-chemo/reviews/1688796,"“Super nice spicy taste that is a break from the norm.
Long lasting stone, super strong, melts mental and physical pain away.
Sweet earth smell with a hint of spice.”"
RoMarWeed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/remo-chemo/reviews/1703938,"“Buena mota, da un buen colocón con sus buenos efectos de sativa pero sin dejar a lado ese efecto de indica te relaja el cuerpo de buena forma sin dejarte tirado en el sofá viendo vagabunderias.”"
