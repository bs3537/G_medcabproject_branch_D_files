SmokingLifter,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gobbstopper/reviews/1392027,"“Not sure if this is the same strain I got here in IL. Very nice indica. Def puts me on couch lock but once the initial body high passes it is very much in the head. So I feel like this may be a indica dominated hybrid. Regardless, it's a nice strain. Be ready to be hungry .....”"

alexismickler,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gobbstopper/reviews/1392025,"“the clinic mundelein says it's a hybrid,  but,  anyways,  it is very kush smelling and fruit flavored:) a good all day herb that makes you feel nice and relaxed. relieves  stress and anxiety.”"
iblaze1026,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gobbstopper/reviews/1392026,"“Pretty awesome strain. Love the flavor (concentrate taste just the same but amplified ten fold). Always super icy, trichome coverage is insane. PTS did one hell of a job with this strain. And the awesome staff at Midwest Compassion Center always have it priced below average!”"
Bluecollar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gobbstopper/reviews/1558760,"“One of my favorite Indica strains. It does have a candy taste to it, as I'm smoking the shatter. Very smooth high with a real great pain-killer effect..almost narcotic with a cerebral buzz too. You will succumb to sleep eventually depending on what you are doing at the time. #1”"
octobersun3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gobbstopper/reviews/1422619,"“Very fruity, lemon, almost ginger flavor with a touch of mint aftertaste makes me happy. I found this to be a good, giggly high with strong euphoric effects. Great for social anxiety.”"
NickMalecki,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gobbstopper/reviews/1566388,"“The body high from this strain is strong and immediate; the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the 1/8 that I bought is really harsh to smoke.
Tastes, looks, and smells great!!”"

Nephilim99,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gobbstopper/reviews/1411415,"“Don't be turned away by the By the low THC factor I picked up an eazy of this Indica  from Green Hand in Spokane for a dub and it's Legit! So good I slept through 3 alarms”"
zippo69,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gobbstopper/reviews/1528450,"“Wow! Great fruity flavors,nice mellow smoking indica, great for movie night. One of favorites!”"
RoaringFlameCat,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gobbstopper/reviews/1785522,"“This strain has a mellow smoke that mellows me out, the only downside, after smoking it all day (two ish bowls) when I went to bed I ended up sleeping for 19 hours. I assume I just got far too relaxed. But I tell you, I felt amazing after I woke up. XD”"
