The scent is a bit strong if you aren't used to it, but I'd MUCH rather prefer smelling cannabis than cigarettes. Plus, it has a rather dense, milky smoke, which I've always though...”"

The Power Kush I am familiar with is a VERY FROSTY and POTENT strain. 

Smells wonderful. Something like a sweet sugary skunk. The smell very much reminds me of "Fruity Pebbles" cereal, but with some skunk funk. The taste is very similar but not quite as pronounced.
