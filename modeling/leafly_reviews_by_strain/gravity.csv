Bacon420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gravity/reviews/1357945,"“The budtender at Rocky Road in Colorado Springs recommended this strain for pain since they were out of cotton candy and banana kush.  

The smell was very strong but smoked through pipe or bubbler there is almost no taste and no cough.  It's soooo smooth and has a great smell when burnt, like the weed I remember as a young adult.  

I immediately get relief from neuropathy pain within seconds.  I'm already on Ne...”"

It has been a huge help in giving me an appetite, controlling nausea, and overcoming taste changes after chemotherapy.  Although it does help with pain, it is not as helpful with that as I thought it would be, and the relief from pain is less like the pain being gone, and more like I just don't care about it as much, which is still a big relief as it alle...”"
princessarsenic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gravity/reviews/1063397,"“Gravity is defiantly one powerful strain! True to it's name this is one heavy strain, a hybrid, but definitely an Indica dominate strain! Very rapid onset stone especially in my body and eyes, however the strong stone didn't last too long and the intense effects trailed off into a pretty mellow and sustainable high. Totally made the mistake of puffing this beauty during the day, cartoon couch lock! Oh well, loved it ...”"

NZRT,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gravity/reviews/1063402,"“Lived up to its name. I succumbed to the effects of gravity and had to lie down and nap soon after medicating.
I expected to be clear-headed and focused like with some other high-cbd strains, but this one was really good at reminding me I need to catch up on some sleep. 
Good as seizure control, tranquilizer/mood stabilizer, sleep aid. Not much of a daytime strain though.”"
bravery767,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gravity/reviews/1063409,"“first time I tried this strain I was in a car with a few friends and after smoking it we could all defiantly "feel" the music over the radio. My friends and I all have a high tolerance from smoking on a daily basis but this was defiantly something interesting for all of us.”"
NoahDakota,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gravity/reviews/1063398,"“It was so long ago and i didnt even remember the name until i saw it. im glad i found this, i highly recommend it. It's perfect for pain, you feel like you're floating. You feel so euphoric that even if you dont get the high of feeling so light that you could be floating, you probably still couldnt feel pain because you are in such a positive state of mind 

Highly recommended :)”"

RudiCanada,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gravity/reviews/1259015,"“Fiery red, dense nugs.  Strong floral scents, smells like Walt Disney and Spring.  Full of sweet flavour.  Soft euphoric onset, long lasting happy high.  Perfect for anxiety or stress.  A real hidden gem!  
Rudi's final thought:  If it's raining outside, or snowing, or wind's blowing, or perfectly sunny.... pack a fat bowl and treat yourself to euphoria!”"

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gravity/reviews/1063406,"“Got this from Urban Healing collective in Seattle. Used in vaporizer. A very small amount (0.05g) provides a noticeable relief of anxiety and depression for 2-4 hours. Very functional. 

Not much of a head high. Slight buzz.”"

dannnypee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gravity/reviews/1145408,"“Picked this up at infinity for $15 a eighth wasn't top shelf but it was their deal of the day recommended for strong pain relief and it was cheap so I tried it out & damn .. This def had me couch locked ! Wasn't too strong or anything but pretty much put me to sleep every sesh I had with this stuff !”"
chick_flick,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gravity/reviews/1164550,"“Nice indica that doesn't give me couch lock. It's more stimulating to me than other indicas I've tried, which is nice. I use it for working on art late at night when I want to relax and get in that zone. I've had some critical creative breakthroughs with Gravity, things just fall into place. Every song I hear immediately becomes my new favorite song. Music is amazing on this one, so is sex. Great for a slow night of ...”"

claytont,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gravity/reviews/1167187,"“This strain is killer! Immediately relieved my back pain and any stress or anxiety you could have. It also has a smoother burn than most but still a slight roughness during intake. Overall effects left me a little sleepy but literally felt like I was weightless due to the uplifting effects of this strain. Shared a bowl with some friends and we all thoroughly enjoyed a comedy or two before hitting the hay for a great ...”"
