Blowfish
=============
JuniorFlip,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1243853,"“Besides the semi-foul taste, I have nothing but praise for this strain!  It's been my go-to, Holy Grail strain for a few months.  Great for pain and anxiety and really good for ADHD-ers like me who need a break from racing thoughts.  Puts me in a light, happy mood.  If you want to sleep, it'll get you there if you decide to go with it, but if you aren't ready to hit the sack, it won't knock you out.  This strain lets...”"
giirlscoutcookies,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1161112,"“Definitely one of my favorite indica dominant strains. No paranoia, or headache. It was a nice body high. Usually indicas make me sleepy and blowfish had a great balance of relaxed/giggly. I honestly wish I'd found this strain sooner.”"
brutusbuckeye,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1225688,"“good daytime indica if that makes sense ha!  it's a heavy hitter but the sativa in her keeps it from knocking you out...so you feel really relaxed but can work at the same time”"
ripsosa2014,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1151349,"“strong”"
xblackrobx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1537324,"“Decent scent (almost like a wine!), meh bag appeal, meh smoke. Honestly didn't really do much for me, helped my back pain some but kind of a dull body and head high, made me foggy with no other real effects.”"
tokahontas215,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1151350,"“Heavy hitter”"

bozo907,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1165254,"“Blowfish left me looking for more, feeling disappointed in the three bowls I packed. Then it hit. The Indica effects pack a nice punch making this a nice strain, but some may want more of a true Indica in place of this hybrid.”"
Leesie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1278454,"“As someone who is high tolerance, I always want to try a strain that has a reputation for being stronger.  While it's an 'ok' head, it's a little fuzzy for my taste and gives me a headache every single time I smoke it.   I tend to prefer 50/50 or sativa hybrids, so this just falls in line with that--indica dominants are not for me.”"
Cache48550,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1263223,"“Currently my favorite for sleeping.  It doesn't take long to be ready for sleep after a few hits off the vaporizer.  This is one of the faster acting strains.  I love the slightly piney scent.”"
CannibasQueen59,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1649242,"“Even though this strain is a 65/35% Indica dominant Hybrid, its still a very nice "high", as the Indica factor really sets the tone for that cerebral rush - trickle down effect of relief. I only use the term "even though" because for the most part I am not a Indica smoker, as they tend to put me to sleep, but not this time, Blowfish works. Great for pain, ADD and just chilling out.”"
jjp2130,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1190266,"“very relaxing, helped alot with headache as well as all others pain.  can def leans more to the satisva side did get super dry mouth.  active yet chill at the same time just go with the flow during the day, yet very chill at night. would recommend for the insomniacs.  Taste not so good but smells good.  All over good bud”"

LeroyBrown420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1233049,"“Stony weed that will take you for a mind ride. Full body relaxation thanks to the G13 genetics. The Sativa side sparks creativity in a day dreamish way. A lovely hybrid that leans Indica heavy, recommended for unwinding after  a long day. Another happy hour superstar.”"
Samemch602,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1687784,"“So this one made me feel so relaxed. I also love how amazing it makes me see life. It is like the movie limited. I can see colors so much brighter!!! It was harsh to smoke in a bong. it also made my mouth dry and eyes super dry. I wasnt hungry at all which is a first, instead super thirsty!”"

GxA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1532675,"“The effects hit super hard after the first smoke. Very very relaxing. I was looking for a strain to help me sleep and this strain has been perfect. It won't completely knock you out and will allow you to enjoy a good buzz before nodding off.”"
lanmowerman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blowfish/reviews/1368444,"“Strong citrus to sweet pineapple smell. Smooth citrus subtle hint of pepper smoke with a heavy cough on the backside  of the inhale. Very nice transition into a strong head high. All over body tingle kicks in after 10-20 min into the high, that goes from the top of the head to the tips of the toes. Finishing with a soft head high and an all over relaxing body high.
An excellent smoke for taking in a favorite movie or...”"
