DylanplayswithDemons,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-zombie/reviews/1396410,"“My mom grew this for her dispensary. She gave me some and I have to say it is my favorite strain yet. Such an amazing head high and an equally great body high. The whole night I felt in a different world and the high lasted so long. It relieve a lot of stress and the whole time I got a feeling that "everything will be alright".”"
Damien,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-zombie/reviews/1361800,"“Excellent strain. I smoke one small joint, and can have almost a whole week of relief from depression and near-dangerous fits of rage.”"
blazin520,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-zombie/reviews/1077453,"“I have really bad anxiety and depression, and some hybrids hit me bad in the anxiety end, but not this one. The buds were nice, and the taste, oh man, nice, my friend compared it to the taste of an old fashioned cigar. I am a White Zombie fan, so yes I was drawn to this before since I had never heard or seen the strain. I would get it again. It is a good day time med, that allows me to be functional, yet relaxed and ...”"

Got a good smooth burn and a body buzz just as strong as the mind high. A good strain to sit back and watch TV too, play video games, be lazy and relaxed.”"

imastoner123,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-zombie/reviews/1357959,"“I'm an avid stoner and have tried many strains. I rarely give a strain a 5/5 but white zombie made me extremely productive and creative while enjoying a high at the same time. I highly recommend it for a non-beginner”"

Colinde,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-zombie/reviews/1077446,"“Surprisingly i got really tired, stoned and distanced to the rest of the world.
My friend could not have a normal conversation with me because my head would go "BAaaahhhhh" after a few sentences. It may be because of the excessive amount that i used. I smoked too much, agreed. But when used in moderation, its just relaxing, and uplifting. I also felt happy, but it wasn't shining through though .

Taste is nothing ...”"

BlazingSince2000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-zombie/reviews/1312686,"“One of the most unique smell I have came across. Reminds me of Christmas with lavender, all spice and hints of nutmeg. For me it was one of the smoothest hits compared to the other strains I have on hand (G glue#4 LAOG, and MTF).

Rainanoel,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-zombie/reviews/1657383,"“This strain just agrees with me. It allows me to focus on what I’m doing without my mind wandering. At the same time it relaxes me, although too much too fast and I may get a little woozy but that’s okay :) and it gives me an appetite as well. Some of this, my warm bed with no plans.... ooooh mannnn :)”"

Headache starts up after a while, feels a little jankie after a bit, but in smaller amounts of use It has it's place, very energetic and uplifting, the pain relieving narcotic effects weren't too profound. Mid range bud, top shelf might have a little different sto...”"
