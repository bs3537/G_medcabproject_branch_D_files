Sour Willie
=============
NJnerd,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1325223,"“I personally use this strain during the day because its a 75/25 sativa/indica hybrid that is much easier to function with than its high THC % indica counterparts. It helps with crohn's disease to an extent - but not strong enough to eat a large portion of food. Tastes great, best when vaped, and also reeks when smoking or vaping, like across the backyard with a pipe level of smelliness. The head high is hard to think...”"
TB4786,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1173016,"“Got this at the Garden State Dispensary in NJ. Great flavor (especially when vaporized). Makes you love everything, food tastes better, great pain killer, stops nausea... perfect for IBS and similar medical conditions. In NJ its labeled SW. 0463% THC, 29.14% THCA and 0.031% CBDA.”"

Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1209482,"“A hard hitting sativa, this will make you hungry after the first puff. Excellent if you have a hard time just looking at food and thinking you want that. Having a golden coat like golden goat brings out the light pale green and yellowish leafs. I like this simply because I know I should be eating more this helps me with my condition greatly. However the downside to this strain, is that the pain numbing is a little ov...”"
nick.diana.102,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1157508,"“Very heady strain with a pleasant body buzz as the description states. When you hit this - wow. You will feel it in your head as soon as you exhale. I have a high tolerance and have been smoking many years and this strain made me even feel a bit lightheaded when I ripped it in a water pipe. Sativa strains give me anxiety these days, especially ones with high THC content particularly from the dispensaries in Boulder. ...”"
Aaronburks,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1207699,"“I was little worried at fist with ting this on due to the fact my wife and I have a bad reaction with high the sativas like ghost train haze but this one gives me all the energy without the paranoia and nausea and can still smoke it at night to wa t check a movie  and not fall asleep, so yeah this one is a most 8f you can find it.”"

YungSoose,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1260565,"“Had a good o of this extremely potent and wonderful strain all the buds light green and just caked over and over with trichomes. Like someone just kept going on the icing on the cake the high is one of the best sativas I've had probably because of its sour diesel ancestry. Focused and feeling like you can tackle anything clean up the shed in the back your room or get to doing something you've been meaning to.”"

Paletrain,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1478230,"“Picked this up at PARC dispensary in Phoenix, one of my absolute favorite dispensaries. They informed me that they were working with a new grower named DIRTY GIRL, run exclusively by women. I just had to try some, as sour D is one of my all time faves, Willie Nelson is a weed wizard, and I'm all about Women's lib (only straight, white males, such as myself, would feel the need to include that last bit) 

I opened the...”"

Psychedelic1420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1688896,"“I love this strain as I’m a huge fan of sour diesel. This made me super creative as well especially when mixing it with other strains like wet dream. A new fave for me! I’m excited to try the new strain named for David Crosby. To have a strain of marijuana named after you is certainly an honor!”"

Candabis3535,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1242035,"“Perfect high! smell and taste is strong and obviously on the sour side. Didn't have any negative side effect, just the normal dry mouth. Was able to stay active and happy and also take a nap when needed. Will definitely be keeping this one on my list of regular smokes!”"
Colorado_Herb_Man,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1138508,"“Excellent hybrid...all the euphoria of sativas without that edgy side that is sometimes felt with the stronger sativas. Gives you a nice steady buzz but at higher doses its a blissfully mind-numbing buzz. I found it great for anxiety because it feels like it just shuts your brain-off, so you can relax, stop worrying and chill in peace. Some shoulder pain relief for my bursitis. Great mix...hopefully this strain takes...”"
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1192993,"“As large as small nuggets and half dollar size boulders I would say sour Willy has very pungent but very sweet characteristics. Its medical treatment or high is different than others I've had. It hits my head with a sense of old memories light and carefree with hints of pain numbing seeping in. Purple and dark hairs gives me a sweet chemical aroma. If you have an appetite problems like me it will make you feel like y...”"

NJnerd,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-willie/reviews/1274130,"“I use this instead of any indicas during the day time so I can function at a normal rate and it tastes amazing on top of it! Super smelly when smoked and even more flavorful if vaped. Helps with crohn's disease to an extent - but indicas definitely help more. Induces a sort of cloudy high with a case of the giggles. Good strain”"
