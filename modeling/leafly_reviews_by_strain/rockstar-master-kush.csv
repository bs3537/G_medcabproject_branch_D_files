High peaks quick with prolonged functional high. Strong but not too strong of a high. Mellow and social. Goes good with wine. Little to no paranoia. Great bud!”"

We had our crop tested and it was at the 20%. 
I had this strain as a constant smoke for 2 months and usually I would be sick of a strain after smoking it for so long but not with this one! Smooth clean smoke & classic Kush taste with a tiny bit of subtle sweet after taste. More of an evening weed but in lower doses it works great for the day as well, especially for heavy smokers. Thi...”"

Strong sensual body buzz,  warm  water moving against my skin was thrilling. 1/2 way in, wanted to get into music, with closed-eye visuals. Next day: pretty bad pain day. After supper medicated with this and started to feel better almost immediately.  I still had to take the anti-inflammatory, but I could put it off until closer to bedtime.  Sav...”"

Not that big of fan of either parent strain but grown right in this cross it has the most narcotic body stone that takes a long time to creep up. It starts out as a buzzing and after a half an hour I lose feeling in my limbs and my head clears. Has a light citrus/earthy nose to it but coats your mouth in flavour. Great strain to have on hand for pain and astro travel.”"

Maddok3D,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar-master-kush/reviews/1311688,"“Didn't blow me away or anything but it's a pretty good mellow high. I got this with two other strains, Tuna and Godberry and I'd probably be a lot more enthusiastic about Rockstar MK if the other two weren't such hard hitters, but don't let me saying that turn you away, it's a good all around strain for chilling out and marathoning your favorite show or making a grocery run. Good body high and in a high enough dose y...”"

brooklol,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar-master-kush/reviews/1181087,"“For me personally it was good not the best but still good I was relaxed and chill 
Smell: sweat smelling and fresh
Taste: the taste is sweat and good 
Burns: it burns to fast if u grind it so make sure to only cut it with sissors other wise it will probably burn like shit”"
MarysHusband,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar-master-kush/reviews/1135962,"“I might have only been excited and hyper when I smoked this because playing Basketball had my blood pumping. But after I was in I Just Wanna Go To Sleep Mode”"
cban,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar-master-kush/reviews/1209985,"“Very nice active buzz which peaks relatively quickly. Focus is enhanced with this bud although it will knock you out if you overdo it at the wrong time in the wrong setting. Has a tendency to let your mind free while not giving a sativa-like response in terms of negative, anxious thoughts.”"
