Better still is that so far this is one of the best strains I've tried for my physical body symptoms of anxiety and stress (tight muscles, feel like I can't breathe well, racing heart, etc). as soon as I have this it all melted awa...”"
mgalling,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1427732,"“Wow. My local bud tender recommended this to me as a sleep aid because I get REALLY bad insomnia. It smells AMAZING first off. Very piney and woody aroma, but a subtle and pleasant taste. Not too harsh despite the 24% THC. The high is great. The body high kicks in first for me. It relaxes all my muscles and takes my pain away, but my mind remains clear for the first 20-30min after smoking this strain. Then OH MY GOD....”"

Rockergurl420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1604909,"“An amazing strain for those who want to relax and chill. Really good for pain! I have chronic sciatica and PTS (post thrombotic syndrome) which affects my legs and Green Love Potion helped with the cramping and spasms. A great indica, it smells like lavender and is amazingly comforting, like hot cocoa on a cold day!”"
Caribbeean420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1307052,"“Those of you criticizing this strain, either had a bad sample, didn't grew it properly or just didn't got what was told to be sold.
Trust me, I'm an "organic cannabis" soil grower.

Very nice strain to grow & smoke, potent smell & pungent taste that reminds a MrClean detergent, lingering in mouth long after passing the joint, even if laced with tobacco or cigarettes.
That is the main feature that you will notice, tha...”"
leprechaunbuttsniffer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1333650,"“Simply put, I've never smoked a strain that can kick me in the face after vaping CO2 concentrate all day like GLP does.”"
inditiva0,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1338506,"“Got this from Doc Croc at 25.1% THC. Not much for cerebral effects, but the body tingle is very nice. Does offer some, not a lot, aphrodisiac properties. Smells like tea, but taste is near non-existent.”"
420Lush,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1397534,"“When I first tried this last year I wasn't impressed.

My dispensary has had this on sale for two moths and it's becoming one of my go to's for the evening. 
 
Maybe this batch is different but OMG I love this strain. Heavy indica but you can still be functional. I like to smoke it early evening to relax me for the night and get much needed sleep.

She's a 80/20 indica-sativa. Will continue buying her she remains on ...”"

strychninecandy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1363184,"“vaped this in soft snap and pull concentrate form from a herbalizer.    taste is mild, smooth and creamy with a light woodiness, more
balsam than oak,  pleasant, easy smoking and surprisingly clear-headed.   I plan on recommending this to patients with pain management needs who are desirous of a great daytime strain.”"
NaturesWayMedicine,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1693249,"“Green Love Potion is now available at Philadelphia despensaries. Patients who have tried Green Love Potion say it has rapid relaxing effects for chronic pain, migraines, and fibromyalgia. Its unique flavors of lavender and menthol and smells of sweet floral and lavender have patients raving about this flower.”"

Very nice n smooth tasting.
First I vaped this on its own...the tase was sweet, pleasant...left that nice aftertaste on your lips..

CaptainQuazar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1704696,"“Nice dense buds that grind to fluffy perfection for vaping. A nice smooth, sweet, flowery flavor. Very relaxing without sleepiness. I normally save my Indicas till later in the day, but this didn't slow me down too much. A fine afternoon treat.”"

Maheux99,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1715283,"“Pretty good Stoney type of high.  Very relaxing and great for watching something on tv.  Pretty good indica strain, but the high only lasted about an hour for me. I wonder if it’s due to the lower the content.”"
Herby_Hacker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1730795,"“Kind of have a special place in my heart for this one. Good flavor, nice vibe. Very "awake" for as body-relaxing, of an indica it is. Kind of a best of both worlds scenario. One of my favorites for right now. I vape with it. I cook with it.”"
LilBrownRabbit,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1798456,"“Tranquil, friendly, and superbly happy trippy dippy love strain. Goes in lightly and floral. Lavender and lemon, touch of rose petal. Sweet come-up, you won't stop smiling. Great body high, waves and tingles down the spine and in the thighs and knees. Definite pain relief. Auditory intimacy. visionary and trippy if you want it. And yet  surprisingly functional. While it leans heavily towards the indica side, I could ...”"

I was aiming to use it as an anti anxiety/sleep/relaxation aid. It definitely has those benefits but not quite like you would think. I had a long drive that caused me to have awful back spasms I was in pain for a long ride home and I finally looked here to find which of my strains would be best for pain and now I know why  this strain stuck out t...”"
sweetwreck,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1292881,"“very bland indica, I really enjoy BD but GLP just hasn't done it for me. no stimulation physically or mentally really. my sample is not a good example I believe although it looks great.”"
sweetwreck,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1292821,"“This is one indica that I really did not enjoy all that much, I believe a lot of the negative effects that I experienced were due to the poor quality in the sample I purchased at my dispensary.
just nothing there as far as any positive stimulation physically or mentally for myself or my wife. I'll definitely”"

Serndip,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1418155,"“Wish I could "Love" GLP! Sadly, I purchased without seeing the product; 2 oz. It's was pretty with purple, hairy, and the worse thing It was dry with lots of baby seeds, and hardly any leaf matter either. Taste is blah, not so good. 

Now for the effects, it's as they say a clearer high. I do prefer the couch lock type(s)! I'll finish what I have and hope to sample again a better GLP product at some point.”"

moonmaiden1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-love-potion/reviews/1626728,"“First time vaping this and it is wonderful. I can’t do a lot of strains that have a sativa edge, makes me jumpy. But this is smooth, I stay chill during the day. And I’m able to be really creative and paint throughout a session. 
Next imma try the flowers.”"
