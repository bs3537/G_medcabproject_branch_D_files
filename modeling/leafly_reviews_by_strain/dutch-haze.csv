ajax_pjus,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dutch-haze/reviews/1395026,"“A smooth, uplifting and energising smoke. With some fruity taste, smoking this in Amsterdam was a pleasure as I worked through a university assignment, helping me create motivation through mundane tasks. A really nice haze!”"
hermyb,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dutch-haze/reviews/1577972,"“One of my favorites. I don’t usually taste the difference in weed strains, but this ones taste was so prominent all I tasted was citrus. So delicious. It’s a happy hazy relaxed high. 10/10 recommend”"
NorthEastSmokerUK,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dutch-haze/reviews/1791097,"“This is an overall all good strain when grown correctly. Produces a fruity citrus aroma when smelt, trichomes are a lovely amber/golden colour. The high thc and low cbd ratio makes this a great day time smoke but can bring on anxiety/paranoia to some users. From the UK🇬🇧”"
Emeken,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dutch-haze/reviews/1674191,"“This is my favorite strain. It gives me an uplifting euphoria and has me feeling creative yet relaxed. I highly recommend listening to music while on this strain or having a small get together.”"
Ekot,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dutch-haze/reviews/1438522,"“maybe it was the batch that I got it from.  Taste very bad.  The only effect that I had was a headache.  

I couldn't even finish a joint at all.  0 trace of Super Silver Haze at all.  

I was expecting this to be the best haze that I have ever had. I am feeling a bit disappointed.”"
Flexology,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dutch-haze/reviews/1376445,"“This thing is super potent and smells really citrusy!
Helped me get over travel fatigue and really relaxing”"
