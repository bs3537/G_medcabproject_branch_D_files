I love everything about it. The aroma smells just like Blueberries. But until inhaled no one will truly understand why the name is Blueberry Muffins and not just Blueberry.

They are a delight to the senses. I wanted to punch someone in the face about 30 minutes ago and now, I don't. The Eagles just fucking scored against the Giants but I'm still euphoric and aroused.”"

Smell & look combined make this a great tasting bud; love these new exotic strains.  A nice indica body warmth to go along that makes u feel like a fresh out the oven blueberry muffin.

951stilltripping,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-muffins/reviews/1413374,"“Whats not to love about big fat purple buds? 
Looking perfect no matter grinded or not. Texture is dry, dusty with crystals and definately sticky inside the nugs.
Smell extremely floral, hint of berry. The inhale/exhale smell very nice, not the overwhelming fuel smell you get from og strains but rather woody kushy like purple kush and trainwreck. 
An all day smoke, start your day with blueberry muffins.”"

Not a straight berry smell, but juicy, slightly earthy, and bright.  A sniff alone is uplifting, and I've found myself opening the jar to take a snoot just because it smells so damn good.

Initial cerebral pop before transitioning into focused, calm, still-lucid ease.  For me this is a great working strain, though as time goes b...”"
