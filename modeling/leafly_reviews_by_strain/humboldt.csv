Jennylg29,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/humboldt/reviews/1393379,"“Hits you INSTANTLY. It's been about 7 minutes, my whole head is soaring. Feels like aliens are lifting my head up into outer space. Wow... this is ballllllllller. Unlike my (moron-dominant) friend- Chocolope, this strain makes you quite smart. Only problems with this strain is 1. it makes you lose focus of everything, don't allow anyone to tell you anything important or any stories. 2. Ya literally don't give a crap ...”"
LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/humboldt/reviews/1415579,"“This strain just popped up in Tx recently and I would have to say im pretty amazed. Its a very very Indica dominant strain that really puts you in a haze. A definite couchlock bud! Buds are beautiful and dense with a very very strong pungent skunk smell too it. This is now a new favorite of mine.”"
StoneyBlogona,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/humboldt/reviews/1378845,"“Great strain, definitely on the more sativa end as far as hybrids go - for me just a small amount was enough to truly appreciate the quality high that this strain is capable of. Can sneak on you a little bit, but for me the euphoric effects were felt for a few hours and really made me appreciate the quality of the strain. Great for smoking early in the day or afternoon, washes away anxiety and really allows you to me...”"

HarryRohr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/humboldt/reviews/1393381,"“first time I had this was in Lake Tahoe some years ago. best damn strain I've ever had. very clear headed.”"
GrapesonGrapesonGrapes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/humboldt/reviews/1378844,"“Really well balanced hybrid. The high was long and euphoric, which lingers for quite a while. Humboldt packs quite a nice punch. As for the flowers, they were a nice deep green with purples and pinks spread throughout. The buds were fat and sticky. They smelled of sandalwood and spice, with a bit of skunkiness. The taste was peppery, woody, and a little sweet. Great for muscle relaxation, stress, and pain relief.”"
meluribe93,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/humboldt/reviews/1415748,"“Wow, this is a pretty rad strain. It gave me and my girlfriend both some creativity. For being indica dominant it sure opened my 
mind a little. Would recommend to those who want to relax and vent.”"

PracticalParrot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/humboldt/reviews/1138767,"“My first review on my first taste of some California bud.
(Note: I smoke a couple times a month)

First time having Humboldt and any California bud was quite an experience. 

It has a very nice shimmering light green aura to it and glistens in the light.  Has a very nice earthy, refined, smell but not too pungent or overbearing.  
The high that this strain provides you is a pretty intense head high (this may be becau...”"

It's like I'm feeling super strong at the same time effects of both sativa and indica. Amazing.”"

TexasMockingburn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/humboldt/reviews/1344025,"“This is one aromatic strain once it hits the mouth... pungent, woodsy, nutty taste. Like an expensive cologne or somethin'! It eases the from the temples to the pain down my spine. Gone. Has me stuck but could move if really necessary. Have a spruce of energy slowly easing its way in. Euphoria has everything kind of shining. Damn Good Meds right here. Stock up”"
MrChuckles,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/humboldt/reviews/1206623,"“Very smooth, regardless of how you get it in your system. Wish I could give it 6 stars for making me come up with a line Snoop already says: groovy like a drive in movie. This toke ain't no joke! 👌🏼🎶🍁🎶😴💨”"
