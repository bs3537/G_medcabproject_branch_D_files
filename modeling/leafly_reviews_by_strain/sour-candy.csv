CBDgirl3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1382024,"“Picked up a strain called sour skittles which I'm assuming is in sour candy's lineage. Sativa strain. Beautiful,  dense nug that still breaks apart with ease. It gave me a happy,  focused,  uplifting high while also providing a great relaxing effect.”"
nico3745,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1359084,"“If you want to be social, I can't think of a better strain to get you into the conversation! This one really surprised me. A couple puffs and I experienced an uplifting wave of optimism that washed over me. I felt happy to absorb other people's thoughts and respond to them with vigor.”"
TokyoXpress,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1409900,"“I picked this up at The Healing Touch in Los Angeles but they called it Sour Skittles. I'm going to assume it's the same strain due to its distinct Candy, Tropical and Diesel smell. It is definitely a very clean non groggy Sativa strain. I often drink and smoke which sedated me a lot but this strain kept me going. Just smoking it by itself it doesn't hit me too hard while giving me a very happy effect. One of the fav...”"

indashab28,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1359083,"“The first time I tried Sour Candy, it didn't really have any specifics. It was just a regular high for me. However the second time, coming home from work & fresh out of a nice shower, I gave it a try and it felt great! It's something I'd go to after refreshing myself and to relax.”"

UncleAcid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1350703,"“So although my tastes generally tend to lean a little more towards the Indica side of the Cannabis spectrum, after smelling some Sour Candy Crumble my guy had, I couldn't help but grab a gram of some wax, some indoor flower, and some outdoor flower (All Sour Candy).

So the wax was absolutely GREAT. Especially on taste. Definitely has a very fruity, piney, sort of jet-fuel/hashy taste. Excellent stuff. Very uplifting...”"
ScarletV,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1376895,"“Such a smooth and yummy sativa. It helps calm my c-ptsd symptoms so quickly and effectively. I can focus and complete tasks that are a challenge for me. I feel energized and want to move, which is awesome because I am usually exhausted. I feel so peaceful, grounded and happy on this strain. Also fab for the libido 😀 #420sweepstakes”"

TooFarGon3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1708523,"“The taste is not good with a wax pen but I’m sure it would be good as just flower. But the high is great if you want to feel relaxed and kinda lazy.”"

cgwinn1985,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1424341,"“I don't know if I just got a bad batch, but this strain does NOTHING for me. No buzz, it burns really quick, and makes me feel like I just wasted my time and money. Total bummer.”"
HiloImSam,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1174476,"“Delicious mild taste (rolled a joint) 
Light green in color with red hairs and lots of crystals. 
I was recommended this strain for daytime use against my back pain, it was a great choice. 
A little dry mouth but a clean clear head high that lessened the pain and tension in my back. Highly recommend.”"
SylvGrac9,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1239498,"“I broke the bud up and  immediately smelled the sweet bubble-gum aroma. Very smooth high, with long lasting effects. Smoked this with my little brother and he said it made him feel really happy. One of my favorite hybrids! 

About to smoke my third joint! :)”"

PFFK,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1219104,"“Not bad, but I can't think of any particular effects it had. Felt like a generic, all-purpose high, nothing mind-blowing. I think I was only able to reach a very high high once or twice. It's good, but nothing special. Too much other stuff out there for me to try, so I probably won't be coming back to this one.”"
greenoverpharma,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1616109,"“Taste is SO fucking good! So much crystals on it I feel so happy and euphoric af. Take it in a quiet place if you want the universe to talk to you.”"
MyJokerHandStayLIT,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1627099,"“A light effect on the body. Not much on the end of body relaxation but my mind is not frustrated or angry at the thing I was just angry about and I feel happy and relaxed mentally. My body more than a deep relaxation is more of a body feels like
Jello feeling. It has a great lightness to it as I mentioned so really good for day time and clear thinking while elevating mood.”"
moonchildd89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-candy/reviews/1765472,"“This strain really surprised me on how light and uplifted I felt. Definitely a good day weed. I also felt waves of euphoria and felt more focused. Not so heavy body high but it’s amazing. A+”"
