Maui

stutterfiend,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/maui/reviews/1378684,"“I felt like trying something different when I headed to the dispensary. I usually prefer heavy indica or indica dominant hybrids. 

I asked for a recommendation.  He pulled out a few jars and Maui happened to be one of them. Very pungent smell. Beautiful dense buds, covered in crystals, almost blocking the view of the forest of yellow hairs. 

I headed home after a full day of not smoking, and packed my bong.

Socalblazer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/maui/reviews/1389772,"“Felt like a strong cup of coffee for me. I was quite up and talkative. The high is very mellow and fades after 2 hours. I personally love it because it doesn't get me stone or couch lock at all. Just a very minor head buzz in the back ground. Doesn't feel very relaxed either. Feels like a strong cup of coffee. keeps u up and running.”"
techn9ne,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/maui/reviews/1065755,"“Maui hit me hard.  While it is a Sativa I felt heavy and my head was cloudy. Very strong buzz which lasted a while so your highness does become a commitment.  Good for back pain, not the best if you are trying to get a lot of errands done however it did allow me to focus on a single task”"
junior_rw,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/maui/reviews/1378680,"“Had to update my last review. This strain is not good for pain relief. Initially it was nice, but after about 20-30 min the pain comes back and the high is still there. Now i'm lazy, focus, and the only thing i can focus on is my pain but i'm to lazy to do anything about it. Not cool!”"
crazycolton55,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/maui/reviews/1348929,"“Although not as good as Maui Waui, this weed takes on a more intense sativa high, but just not as enjoyable in my opinion. I also have it lacking potency, so with its not very tropical in my opinion more skunky with citrus aftertaste flavor, 3.5/5”"
