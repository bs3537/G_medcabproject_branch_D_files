Over all an amazing high. I was stimulated, giggly, and happy beyond belief. Helped loads for muscular and bone pain relief in my legs, all aching gone and a great time to boot! I was easily active but no anxiety at all. A comfortable, pain and anxiety free time.”"

No anxiety/paranoia (a must for me). Head high energetic; definitely a daytime med. Body high very nice; just what I needed. Got a kick outta the tight buds & red hairs; high quality for sure.

Narpet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-magoo/reviews/1388481,"“I've suffered from true migraines since I was a child (for over 40 years) and I've recently come to MMJ for relief because I can't stand the prescriptions and I can't have caffeine (which works great for migraines but I'm allergic to). I researched and researched and decided to make Blue Magoo my first try.

When I was younger I smoked a lot for recreation, but I'm way past that, so I'm truly looking for pain relief....”"
Somnus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-magoo/reviews/1372186,"“Blue Magoo looks and smells outstanding. The description on leafly is spot on, so I do not know what else to add other than to say Blue Magoo leans on the indica side of things. It is also worth noting that I did not get the munchies while medicating and it wasn't overly harsh, which is a welcome change from some of the harsh and heavy indicas I have been coming across lately. Overall 9.5/10. This strain also regular...”"

Blue Magoo from WAM Oil, good stuff, not as much flavor as expected and the high was shorter lived. Bit disappointed, but will try again. Good for people with anxiety, depression and headaches.”"

Blue Magoo has a great balance between Sativa and Indica properties that really do deliver the best of both worlds--pain relief without that lingering "I need a nap" feeling. If you're needing to get work done around the house, going out with friends, or simply just want to enjoy your day pain-free, I'd...”"
ShamrockSulli,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-magoo/reviews/1412887,"“Not quite my "holy grail" of weed but not far from it. Definitely an exceptional strain that I have the pleasure of growing and smoking my own. In my opinion it is best at 10 weeks then cured for 3.
I also call it "the cancer patients dream"

It's a beautiful looking flower. 
It immediately lifts any depression, nausea and laziness from my body. You can see colors more vividly, and your mind starts working overtime. 
This is my go to day smoke. It is definitely an upper for me.”"
FemmeSnazzy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-magoo/reviews/1223593,"“So sweet and satisfying. Blue Magoo seems to kick in immediately after inhale, and is soooo super effective for remedying nausea and lack of appetite. Plus anxiety attacks, night terrors, soul-draining stress, menstrual cramps, headaches...it's just an excellent strain all around. Plus it's super pretty, with the light blue sparkly crystal frosting. I highly recommend.”"
