Hellfire OG
=============
IandI,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1380557,"“This is one schizophrenic, bipolar strain. First, it lifts you up and gives you nice burst of energy and motivation for about 20 to 25 minutes, almost like Green Crack or Moby Dick, and then it drops you on your ass on the couch like Master Kush or some kind of heavy Indica, and says "stay!"

So, it makes you super social and talkative, and then you just want everyone to go home so you can watch a movie. Great for do...”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1413349,"“Wow very impressed by this hell's fire by skord. The look is amazing. The smell is confusing because it smells mostly woody like coriander and slightly sweet. The smell is light on the nose. Yellow trich covers these yellow and some dark blue buds with tiny minimal neon green leaves hidden among the plush fullness of the nugs. Small few barely visible hairs tucked in the nugs. The trich is dripping off it. The smoke ...”"
icybluheart,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1372495,"“I got lost in my shower. I sh!t you not. This strain is *QUALITY*. 

Other than Blue Dream, I can't think of another hybrid that so nicely balances its sativa and indica characteristics—although this one may lean ever so slightly indica, while Blue Dream leans sativa. 

Best of all, I love its versatility. Great for daytime (I practically can't shut up) and evening (have you SEEN Westworld?!) activities.”"
MattiV2007,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1361804,"“"It's punchy.  It's super good, but it just makes me hit people while laughing a lot but not in like a mean way, more like a way to grab someone's attention, but with force. Now I abuse my husband. Grade A smoke bruh." -DV.   -this was my wifes review and I concur it makes her punchy.  Really good though.  Great relaxed high.”"
elwayfan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1388078,"“The first time I tried it, I loved the smell at the dispensary so I was convinced to try a couple Gs. I went back the next day and bought an ounce! Beautiful buds, OMG! That did not prepare me for the wonderful sedation I was about to receive.  When you're ready to lay back, relax and forget your sorrows and pains and become one with the wonderful world of couch potatoes, this will rock your world!!
 highly recommend...”"

kanna37,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1367896,"“Five stars straight across.  Although how this strain works for me and what it affects is almost diametrically opposed to what its effects are for most people.  It doesn't make me euphoric or energetic at all, in fact it's completely the opposite.  For me this is the most powerful sedative I've ever been on.  And I'm talking even prescription drugs such as the benzo's that I've been on at various times for my anxiety...”"
OGBONEZ21,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1244487,"“Good smoke, Strong overwhelming body and heady. Early onset just like any other OG strain, Citrusy Diesel smell taste and effects.”"

xNightmariNx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1685422,"“This is probably my favorite strain to smoke with friends, as the initial giggly/bubbly effect of it is insanely fun. It totally knocked out my anxiety so mad bonus points for that. After about 20 minutes it completely changes into more of a body high. Such a rollercoaster of a strain.”"
stanmccann,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1267008,"“I just got some shatter that was named slightly different, "Hell's Fire."  It has very similar effects as some of these reviews.  Very good pain relief, nice high and clear headed and energetic enough to do "stuff."”"

JonG27,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1367895,"“60/40 s/i

Yeah, this one is a heavy hitter.   Instant  deep body relaxation.  Not a heavy sedation per say but more of a tingly numb and relaxed state.   Can be a bit intense but this does not last long.  

This one is a bit heavier than my normal ratios which are usually weighted very heavily on CBD concentrations as I am coming off anxiety meds.  So this was an interesting experiment for me to have a very high THC...”"
snow4ever,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1446826,"“Yes - highly recommended. As others have noted a definite one two punch. First euphoric then it brings you down - in a very good way. It's a creeper at first you might think it isn't that strong a moment later you realize that you just lost track of the last half hour. I vaped it, very little taste which  leads to the gross misconception that it might not be very strong - then POW! A new favorite. This review is for ...”"
BaronOfBud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1234751,"“Dabbalicious x Crockett Family Farms Hell's Fire OG Live Resin Crumble is pure fireeee. Tastes of sweet lemony citrus with subtle hints of diesel and pine. Potent hybrid effects near to even on the indica/sativa side, head in the clouds while body is mellowed out.”"

Enough mental motivation while relaxing the pain away. Can't wait to use when I roller skate. If Hells fire feels like this I'm a start doing bad things to get to hell😈”"
Sondoor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1440595,"“I have had some strong strains before but first fatty bowl of this and it flattened me. Instant rush to the head very cerebral high (can make you feel dizzy) and quite energetic actually but has an indica crash that can put you to sleep. The high its self can last for a very long time i would say this is definitely for experienced users. A well balanced hybrid.”"
MGSPlasmaSnake,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1267791,"“Was a great hybrid with good THC percentage. The smoke was great, but the effects were lacking a bit. Not a bad daily smoke to get stuff done.”"

Ungod,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1367304,"“The taste.... is awful.  It tastes like I'm smoking the dirt out of the oil change pit at Jiffy Lube.  I'm only one bowl in and I cannot continue to smoke this.  It's like I'm being punished for wanting to get high.”"

cooljoe91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hellfire-og/reviews/1750176,"“This is a fast growing strain for a reason. Although there is plenty of THC the fast yield leads to smaller herbs. Don't  expect a crusher nug, bigger then a gram and a 1/2. However, the creative side with your initial smoke is impressive, I did all my laundry while taking bong rips. I really got it all done, then I crashed after eating a bag of herb candy. Watch out for the crash about 20 after smoking just saying i...”"
