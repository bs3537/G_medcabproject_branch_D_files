UniverseAccordingtoRob,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunshine-daydream/reviews/1363276,"“A unique strain. Subtle flavor, exhibiting cerebral stimulation instantly, with perceptual distortion in spacetime and a subtle lifting of the subconscious at around 30 minutes, with very pleasurable waves of little beads messaging my muscles, skull, neck, jaw, ocular pressure; great for headaches and TMJ—and pain relief riding on the crest of a slightly anxious, though exploratory curiosity. I went outside; and this...”"

In cartridge form, Sunshine Daydream not only relaxes my body and eases a lot of pain in my back, but it also is one of the happiest feeling highs I’ve ever experienced. It’s amazing, and if you ever have the opportunity to try it just do it, or else I’ll be mad at you.”"
Arizontnightmare,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunshine-daydream/reviews/1671640,"“This strain is really interesting to me. It doesn’t feel like an indica because you feel so up and then you slowly calm down. Time is slow but not in a head rush kinda way. Just peaches. I laid in bed and listened to some music and the euphoria is so good in this strain. And pain relief is perfect. I do really admire this strain.”"

cranie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunshine-daydream/reviews/1525874,"“Unlike anything I've experienced before. I usually stick with Indicas as i deal with anxiety. This came highly recommended and I got in in a rosin. I did one TINY dab and it came on FAST and heavy. Very overwhelming as time and space became altered so I felt anxious but the actual panic never came. After walking around for about an hour and then eating a bit I started to level off and the indica side kicked in. THEN ...”"
emperorcannabis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunshine-daydream/reviews/1572282,"“This stuff is amazing. Hits you right behind the eyes before you even start to exhale. Has an incredibly sweet aroma.

GenYHippie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunshine-daydream/reviews/1065659,"“Still feeling this one out but i thought it deserves a review :). When i vaporized this i felt "edgier" than expected for a indica dominant which threw me a bit which may have contributed to the racy anxiety i felt. Nothing panicy but not content or relaxed either. 

Now that ive had a taste i  know to experiment with this one during the daytime. BTW when i bought mine it was listed as a hybrid.”"
