Gooberry
=============
OtterOtaku,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1384750,"“Again, another entry into my favorite strains. Don't pass this one up!!

Initial thoughts upon smoking this strain: The onset of this strain brings around a warming sensation that centralizes in a point on the forehead. This then spreads to create what I explain as a sauna towel wrapped around the head. This seems to wash over the whole body, but most noticeably on the shoulders and head. Brought a slight sense of ti...”"
LeroyBrown420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1363721,"“Interested thing about this cut. It has a great get things done Sativa buzz. However, the more you consume the more sedating she becomes. Great looking buds, decent smell, squishy, good flavor, slightly harsh. Fantastic med overall, not a super strong Indica, energetic Sativa traits at lower dosages.”"
annabeanOG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1552827,"“This is the love strain. 
Unpleasant thoughts that I usually dwell on when I smoke sativas are seen from a more objective point of view and they are no longer bothersome. 

It makes you feel euphoric without being overly energized (similar to mania) and instead makes you feel relaxed from the head down. 

The best way I can explain the anti-anxiety properties is that every anxious thought you’ve had about negative pa...”"

I am super happy to get my hands on this Gooberry goodness! :S”"
DanTHCmaster,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1363722,"“This strain gave me a active high. I felted energized and happy. Good for a wake up in the morning. #energized #chilled #hyped”"
OGSirSmokeALot,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1363366,"“Strong, astringent-floral smell, light green leaves, dark red/light brown hairs with light frosting, and average density.

Flavorful earthy taste, disguises the potency of the flower.

Causes very relaxed feeling, eyes get very heavy, so it's perfect for winding down for the evening or relaxing before bed as it makes an excellent sleep aid.”"
BananaCOIn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1363361,"“Perfect when I can't sleep or to just sit around watching Netflix.”"

kintoun,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1363359,"“Gave me a very good body high, dizzy when tried to get up. Good for sleeping and relaxing.”"
amberkelly,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1363365,"“Gooberry is a good strain, having no appetite is my favorite characteristic.  Gooberry is a very good Indica and I will purchase it again.”"
ComingOfTheHaze,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1375234,"“Very strong potent, sweet smell. Sweet yet dieselly taste reminding me of Blue Dream in some way. Overly strong indica, yet a sativa like buzz leaving me with constant laughing and munchies.”"
mandresen24,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1433889,"“Smooth and kicked back....”"
blueleprechaun,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1556421,"“Gooberry is my go-to evening enjoyment. I can't wait until Artizen comes out with a concentrate. The flower isn't exactly pungent, but more enveloping on the senses if that makes any sense. It's obviously sweet and berry, but it also seems to warm you and the room. Relaxing, positive (I liked what Annabean said about it recently), dreamy and very euphoric. No anxiety, paranoia, headache or dizziness that I've experie...”"
Billythekid2.0,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1376696,"“Very dense berry flavoured buds, really is a hard hitter! The high is a true indica leaving you feeling very chilled for a good 3-4 hours after a nice joint. Threw a percolator bong, a slight harsh, cough inducing hit that leaves you instantly couch-locked and very much received my lower (worn) disc complete relief from aches and pains! Would recommed”"
kjenn74,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1527391,"“Great night time strain for comedy TV binge watching and sex followed by raiding the fridge with a deep nights sleep.
I smoke 24/7 and especially keep this strain tucked away for those nights when I need a good O and 8 hours of deep sleep.”"
Jensen75,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1364103,"“Got some gooberry the other day from the greenhouse. Great looks, mellow smell and taste, overall a great smoke for any time of the day.”"

Super stoned love it”"

kintoun,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1383023,"“So giggly!! Great for watching a funny tv show or hanging with a buddy.”"
tuliptx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1433201,"“I am so grateful for this stuff. Riding out Hurricane Harvey with a smile on my face. This stuff had me relaxed and baking Snickerdoodles while watching Disjointed (Goddess bless Kathy Bates lol). I even got two loads of laundry done. I was alert enough to watch for tornados but my anxiety is definitely under control. rxj38l: rock me like a hurricane if 😜💕”"
mario4122,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1382972,"“Amazing strain for when you're sleepy! Would recommend but it is a heavy hitter, two hits and I'm high!”"
BowlsOPlenty,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1622053,"“💦🍓🍇 as the name suggests gooberry is a lovely flower with tight dense nugs, pungent smell, a flavor between Earth Berry and gas or when I call my favorite! Definitely a winner and not overly sweet for my gassy taste buds. All around great medicine. From just relaxing to deep thinking this will get it done😉 💦🍇🍓”"
queenscythe,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1240596,"“Sadly, I'm going to also have to say that this strain is not my favorite. It gave me a headache and was very harsh. 😕”"
nwcanna,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1612226,"“Perfect strain! All around pleasure to smoke! Great taste and great high! Perfect for insomniacs! This one is in my top 5.”"
iamkeysersose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1242621,"“This stuff is pretty good! It's tasty and definitely has left me buzzing on less than half a fat joint. I just feel good and it is hitting the spot after a long day...cheers!!!”"
AegisArtNW,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1696256,"“I tried to leave a review while smoking this and couldn't remember how. so I went to find snacks instead. Then I just smiled for a while. My back hurts less. Its time for bed. :)”"
molex333,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1605863,"“It does the job of making me sleepy, but it also make me real thirsty (enough for me to wake up multiple times to get a drink), which offsets its effectiveness for me. Also, it has a tendency to make me feel a little dizzy too which I do not like.”"
Tarkington,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1771253,"“euphoric and super laid back. good for just kickin it”"
Mr.smoke,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gooberry/reviews/1395845,"“it was 21% thc got me high but its just plane gives a head high and light body these are just two old strains maybe cool for new smokers but the taste to old school for me”"
