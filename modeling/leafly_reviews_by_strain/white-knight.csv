loznat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-knight/reviews/1388510,"“Bought an eight from my local rec store here in WA state, and as a daily smoker for ~25 years, I can honestly say its one of the greatest strains I ever Smoked. Might be a new fave. Anxiety depression stress and pain melts away almost on exhale, a smooth, sweet, candy-like taste, and by the 3rd bong hit, I set it down and was baked for 2-3 hours. It moves from mind  down to body, and couch melt without couch lock.  A...”"
silasbotwin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-knight/reviews/1353861,"“Although in my area of Washington, White Knight is a cross of White Widow and Blue Knight, making it a very heavy hitting indica. True to the scent it has an piney pungent smell to it and tastes sweet like berry and skunk, long lasting body high for about 2 hours and a nice sedating effect. Great for pain, hyperactivity, insomnia, stuff like that. Definitely worth shelling out the big bucks for this top shelf indica!...”"

I picked up an eight of this wonderful strain today, and just took three medium hits from a bong. It brought me sunshine on a literally cloudy day, very quick. Anxiety, stress, headache just melted away. My body is following now. Warm and fuzzy, euphoria in mind and body. I am a daily smoker, old school, since the early 90's. I highly recommend this if you are l...”"

PoignantTips,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-knight/reviews/1313359,"“Found this strain at Kaleafa in Oak Harbor, WA. A group called Fire line which I guess is named after the fire flower they produce. This stuff has 26.2% THC. The smell out the sealed bag won't fill your nostrils or impress you at all. It's an earthy fragrance. I found the taste a bit harsh but I haven't clean my pipe in a while. The high was definitely uplifting. I found some energy too which I usually attribute to a...”"

skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-knight/reviews/1660139,"“One of the strongest strains I've had in my life. Knocked my partner and I on our asses... ate a bunch, laughed at the TV, and then got so sleepy it hurt my face to stay awake. Its... yeah. Really impressive.”"

azmiked,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-knight/reviews/1237670,"“This is a totally killer flower all the way around! The aroma is so sweet and earthy and piney, delish!! The smoke is mild going down and slightly tarry on the exhale. The high initially is strong and heady but then turns towards the body and provides groovy relaxation with no couch lock. An A+ hybrid for me!”"
NerdyMo420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-knight/reviews/1242619,"“Very relaxing, made me feel somewhat lazy and couch-locked at first. But was able to get up and get stuff done. Definitely has an uplifting quality that would be good for anxiety and depression.”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-knight/reviews/1789649,"“Munchies are off the wall with white knight. I had a nice relaxing body and mind effect with a slight happiness. 45 minutes after no appetite, just a steady focused chilled happy effect. My appetite became monstrous and never ending. The taste is very complex with what seemed like every major terpene. Lemon, berry, pine wood, floral, hoppy. It was like a fruit punch tea. Looks are top shelf thanks to fireline in WA. ...”"
jpullin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-knight/reviews/1240436,"“was very excited after reading the reviews however very disappointed in the strain... though...I have a feeling it may have been grower error. the buds, though dense, have no color in the trichromes and smells of chlorophyll. it's disappointing to see these amateur errors from a grower who feels they are good enough to supply dispensaries. pulling plants too early and curing too quickly is abuse of the flower and the...”"
