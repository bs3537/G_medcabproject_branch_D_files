puppybreath07,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1394594,"“This flower is a 1:1 ratio of THC:CBD. Being someone who suffers from anxiety and having a pain disorder my options can tend to be limited. I acquired White Harmony from Greenhouse Mokena. This is my go to for the end of my work day. It's amazing.  It has a beautiful balance of euphoria with relaxation. Great way to calm down pain and enjoy the evening yet get a great nights sleep.”"
emster89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1394595,"“If you need arousal then I highly recommend this! Not only that but it puts you in such a loving positive mood. Would recommend this if you have felt like you were stuck being negative for a few days. It is a bit pricey but definitely worth it!!!”"
casparproject,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1340549,"“Just a note that some people are confusing this strain with White Harmony, which is a high CBD content strain.  Regular harmony is about 17% THC and <0.1% CBD.”"
Jimmyk164,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1394597,"“Great daytime strain although it is rather heavy hitting. Gives me an energetic, happy buzz. The aroma is phenomenal like having a bag of hawaii in your house lol taste is similar to its aroma, a pineapple lemony flavour with earthy undertones. I like this strain very much and would purchase again!”"

HazySativa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1357299,"“There's many reviews here that are referring to the CBD strain of Harmony. This review is for the 14.5% THC strain from Tilray. Upon opening the SkunkSack I was hit with a nice earthy aroma and a great variety of nuggets in size and colour.

Immediately I notice the dark purple, deep green buds heavy in trichome, and covered in the orange hair of Acupulco Gold.  There's a distinct flavor aroma that would be similar t...”"
casparproject,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1355459,"“Lemony and potent, this sativa hybrid jumped out at me when I was comparing strains at my dispensary.  Very tasty when vaped and very effective.  This will be a repeat purchase.”"
TwinkleToes2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1554585,"“White Harmony is the best strain when needing to be functional. You won't feel over medicated to work or be around others. It's even THC to CBD ratio makes it a great daytime strain”"
Doodle-Oop,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1503077,"“The Harmony strain has a nice chill to it, it's very relaxing and keeps my pain to a minimum. I can't seem to find many negatives to it. I highly recommend it, it's one of the few strains I've found that really does the job for me.”"
amandajean,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1584270,"“Shared some with a friend, got an incredible massage, ended up in a happy dream state, still had energy to wash the dishes and clean up before laying down to watch a movie. Did some writing, felt inspired. A new favourite, overall.”"
jvcdenon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1330711,"“Not as good as advertised as far as I'm concerned mellow Buzz minor pain relief for me was looking for much more. Very good flavor though”"

daky420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1355483,"“Harmony is purely sublimely blissful!!!  Definitely a wonderful strain if you are wanting your day to be just pure, easy-sailing bliss!
Big-time mood lifter, incredibly uplifting!  Great for socialising and if you want to get up and get things done in a totally chilled out yet focused way.
A little hard hitting initially if smoked when you first wake up but by a couple joints into the morning you are just in pure, un...”"
eareifman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1308148,"“Harmony is one of the best strains I've ever tried. I struggle with a poor appetite and this one really gets the job done. I find it also is deeply relaxing and a very clean high.”"
Nattybear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1651077,"“Really good weed for daytime - doesn’t make me feel stupid or slow and I feel focused. Would be a great weed to smoke with friends at the beach and relax”"

vetbeerweed85,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1243480,"“Perfect balance. 6-7% THC and CBD each. Great for my anxiety, PTSD, and spinal stenois. I love this. Gives me a nice balanced high.”"
HeadHertz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1244719,"“This is some of the best smoke I've ever fully enjoyed. Flavour is a wonderful lemon note, with rich tasting smoke. I've smoked many strains and this one stands out over most. Harmony is a little gem and when you come across this strain you won't be disappointed.”"

Lngk0194,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1673075,"“I have never had a bad experience like this. I have experienced extreme paranoia with this strand. Never purchasing again.”"
Steved333,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harmony/reviews/1340550,"“Tilray patient review. You need to vape enough to get the full effect. Not a lot, it just took a bit longer/more than I thought it would. At first I was disappointed in that I was getting a mild head buzz and minor pain/anxiety relief but after a few more minutes that changes. There is a nice mellow euphoria which is slightly uplifting. Pain relief increases over time of use. If I vape too much I feel dizzy and nause...”"
