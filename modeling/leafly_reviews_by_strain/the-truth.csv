The Truth
=============
saiamne,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-truth/reviews/1389799,"‚ÄúRemarkable strain, even amid the current proliferation of varried genetics; the first I've felt compelled to review and rate a 5.

As sampled 10/2014:

The flavor is at once familiar, owing to a very sweet and clean skunk flavor, and unique in the interplay with the chem twist. The resin production is heavy, sparkling; flowers a medium-heavy overall density; impressive for the strong sativa presentation in character....‚Äù"
nachtauge,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-truth/reviews/1417654,"‚ÄúA very uplifting strain from my experience. I felt very positive and happy but very lazy while medicated.

The Truth is listed as a hybrid and It has been my favorite hybrid for awhile now, some things take its place from time to time but I always come back to the truth. THC is shown as 19.5% but it still hits me nicely even when my tolerance is high. 

The effect on this is what I like to call a "do stuff high." I smoke it and I want to ...‚Äù"

I found the Truth to be a light, mellow, relaxing, and focusing strain that added brightness and a calm euphoria to my day and activities. As someone with anxiety and emotional imbalances, I found it to be a vital medicinal to feel "normal" and active in my day. I feel very rela...‚Äù"
