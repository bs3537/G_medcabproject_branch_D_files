Godzilla Glue

GreenGolfGuy21,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/godzilla-glue/reviews/1366838,"“I got this strain from ECC in central CA. SB to be exact.  I liked it.  Very woodsy, earthy bouquet.  Lighter green in color than expected but had yellow-ish hairs.  The combination of the two colors play off each other to give off a 'glowing neon' look.  Great bag appeal.

I'd have to say the only remarkable characteristic of this flower was its appearance. Other than that, I feel it's a middle of the road strain.  ...”"

The nose is intriguing - a hint of fuel but mostly toast and a spice you can't quite put a name to but you know it.  The smoke is dense but even.  And when the head high comes on -- it's a treat.  Starts as a lovely, Peaceful feeling of Calm that seems to ask 'Where ya want to go?'  One could answer, "The couch, dude".  To which the Peaceful Calm would say, "Let's go become one with the c...”"

I've had lower back pain for years, been on flexeril, did phisical therapy which helped but the pain was still there. within 45 min of smoking this the pain was gone. Also elevated my mood and helped with my anxiety. Great for socializing and not forgetting where your going half way through a sentence. All around this is definitely something I'll be smoking for a while.”"

Kyrcksn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/godzilla-glue/reviews/1644078,"“I got this strain as a recommendation from a budtender at MMMP Collective in Michigan. The first time I tried it, I rolled it in a joint and smoked half that night. It took about 15 minutes for the effects to kick in, but it was gentle. The tension in my body melted away and before long the night just slipped by. I felt very calm and comfortable falling asleep. 

I used this again during the day time to see how it fe...”"

BeenBlowinOG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/godzilla-glue/reviews/1625322,"“This strain is straight fire 🔥 I picked this up because 1 I haven't heard of this strain yet, and 2 I am a huge fan of the GG#4. So when I smoked it, it felt as if Godzilla had kicked me in the chest, and then proceeded to sit on me while I was down. This strain is now my personal favorite strain.”"
uniqueray,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/godzilla-glue/reviews/1764032,"“Boosted my creativity and art-ingesting properties. Loved listening to music and seeing shows and movies after smoking this. Became moderately paranoid most times, though. Mine was called Gorilla Glue which may be a little different from Godzilla Glue, but this was the closest name listed on Leafly. 8/10”"
