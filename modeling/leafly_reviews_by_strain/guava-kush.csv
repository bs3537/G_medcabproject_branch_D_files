=============
ktrey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-kush/reviews/1417898,"“It's a top end sativa. I love the taste. I've always found the high to set in slowly and turn into a pleasant mellowness. This is what I would smoke during a lazy day at the beach.”"
riotslug,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-kush/reviews/1356440,"“Aided in reducing nausea and it tastes super citrus-y and sweet which is a great plus. It might make you a little more sociable just because it slows down racing thoughts and reduces my anxiety.”"
ferminortolaza,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-kush/reviews/1356302,"“very short high but very enjoyable. good for those short breaks between work or classes. it will make you a couch potato and sleepy if you dont entretain your mind or do an activity.”"

Perfect for a nice boost in creativity (for me songwriting) but also perfect for a sunny day hike or a lazy day in the city.  Also great for just chillin with friends.  Idk something in this strain hits my brain the right way.  I've never had any negatives, and Ive gotten it in a few places on the WC.  Can't go wrong.”"

AcidBlitz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-kush/reviews/1171924,"“For the cannabis fanatic going after a smoking experience focused on flavor, Guava Kush is what you're looking for. It's sweet, tropical flavors are strong and just overall delicious. But, considering this is a sativa (the Guava Kush I got from my dispensary was measured at 85/15 sativa dominant), this isn't a strain that you would smoke during the day. It makes you extremely sleepy during the high. This is not a pic...”"

intothedivine22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-kush/reviews/1779380,"“This is not the strain for me. Coming from a past of smoking cigarettes, this strains oddly similar when smoked and hits harder than tobacco. Ultimately had to switch to something else because I was getting bronchitis from this strain. The whole suffocating while smoking this stain was awful but could easily switch over to forbid fruit with not coughing problems”"
carini77,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-kush/reviews/1781193,"“Good buzz. Nothing crazy, takes a good number of rips to do the trick.  Taste is almost gsc like, more fruity though. Smell reeks up everything when it is in the bag.....smells just like a guava. :)
 Breaks down into a nice fluffy powder. Too many super wet or super dry cures going around recently.”"

I felt a buzz, but it was a really short one.  Their are other strains more effective Everyone has their own preference, each strain affects people differently. This may work for you, but there's better options. 

The interesting thing about this strain is it literally tasted and smelled like White...”"
