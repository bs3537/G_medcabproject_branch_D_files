Ridiculously hard-hitting for a sativa, I picked up some of this bc the reviews on leafly made it sound cool. Effects: initially there's an intense rush of relaxation/happiness/euphoria. This is one of the most euphoric strains I've ever had actually. Then a light, weird body load kicks in and it's like you're stoned several ways at once. It's hard to describe…it's not a more c...”"

Left me feeling like everyone noticed how crazy baked I was... Forgot everything on my agenda. Fell asleep sucking on a dumb dumb. Woke up with the sucker stuck dead center on my forehead. Got up and looked in the mirror and... 
I was like a unicorn. 
Thanks for the ride Crystal Coma.

julian_cr,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/crystal-coma/reviews/1344363,"“My favorite strain so far (I've tried 30 or so). When I smoke this, I'm being productive and doing things for hours afterwards. An excellent way to knock out your daily chores. Not super high energy but you have lots of motivation to do things. Pretty good for listening to music. Also gives me a massive boner.”"
KushGypsy420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/crystal-coma/reviews/1383755,"“I am glad I left this for a night after a 10 hour shift. It was relaxing then suddenly zapped any energy I had to get up off the couch. Do not recommend for new stoners. I can see how paranoia can be an issue. For someone with experience and a heavy workload expect to be pulled out of your own head. When I get off work I'm still thinking about it for a few hours after some days. I will keep a gram around just for day...”"

IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/crystal-coma/reviews/1307675,"“Definitely a mind eraser. Very cerebral and leaves you a happy mental fog. Very sedating even without a body high, so not really as much of an active strain.

xRyuta,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/crystal-coma/reviews/1137673,"“This is definitely my go to strain! It as the best of both worlds! Since it's a sativa dominant, you get the typical uplifting effects from sativas but with the heavy potency and body high of an indica strain. The smell is amazing, kinda lemony if you'd ask me. Haven't been able to find this strain in any dispensaries in my area besides Green Gorilla. I always end up picking some up whenever I go.”"

Has me staring off into space but I can also get super into TV with this strain. Very potent sativa with nice body effects. I found it to have pretty strong burn out but that's easily fixed with a different sativa. Definitely worth a try if you get the chance.”"
