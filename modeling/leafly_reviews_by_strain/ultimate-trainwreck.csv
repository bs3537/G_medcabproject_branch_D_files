Just make sure you have a couch nearby, because you won't be leaving it for a few hours. Smelled like an Angel's Lady Parts, after they'd been put through 4 Quarters of an NFL game. I wouldn't have it any other way.”"

Before school (8:00 am) I took 6 hits outta a mini Bong (3 of them were greens) and by the time I got to school, damn let me tell you it shot my head up into space and forgot my body. I couldn't see or talk cause it was so strong and the head sensation was just unbelievable. I would recommend this If your trying to forget life and stay glued to your couch. But do not do this shit if your planning to g...”"

Picked it up from my all time favorite Collective LAX Compassionate Care (R.I.P) late one Wednesday night. The door man hassled me for coming in "right at prime time".

Fun wise there are a lotta of better sativas.. But if headaches arent your issue the strong batches of trainwreck makes a great sativa physical med.. It seems to numb pain & definitely will put you to sleep or...”"

ProphetofJah,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/ultimate-trainwreck/reviews/1235618,"“Trainwreck has a crazy citrusy smell and taste that is like Fruit Loops crossed with Sour Diesel.  Strictly Sativa it's great for hiking and biking, a great plant for when you have to be active and it also helps with muscle discomfort.”"

First off let me say, beautiful buds and frosty as well. Anyways I loaded one bong bowl of this stuff and was blown by the time it was gone and sometimes it takes me 2-3 bowls to get a good buzz.

It will make you feel euphoric and energetic in a hurry, and as well as enhancing your focus, Ultimate Trainwreck will help you get ready for some action.

When you consume this strain you will feel less stressed, and it also works well agains...”"
