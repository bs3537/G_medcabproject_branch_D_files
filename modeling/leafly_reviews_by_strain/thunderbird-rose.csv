Very happy uplifting sativa with some calming effects. No anxiety or paranoia accompanied 
With this journey. My head feels warm and tingly. 
Appearance is ok. Smell is of Hints of rose an ganja. Very good to start off Christmas Day. My bluenose pit was also happy with the cloud he received as he went to his dog bowl and looks as if he is smiling.”"

The THC content tends to run in the 21-24% range.  The reason why I like it so much, I tend to have a higher tolerance then most, and Thunderbird gets me where I want to be.

Picked this up on one of my usual trips to Eugene, OR.  Shout out to NoDak Green Prarie in Eugene.  Very unique rose scent and fabulous uplifting effects.  I had purchased it for my sativa loving SO, but ended up smoking nearly all of it myself.  According to Leafly, its a Eugene born and bred strain.  Would defini...”"

If you remember smoking cigarettes they remind me of Carlton very light but full of flavor it’s like you’re smoking nothing at all. Nice buds chunky and floral, comes on nice and settles into a productive buzz 🔥👍”"
