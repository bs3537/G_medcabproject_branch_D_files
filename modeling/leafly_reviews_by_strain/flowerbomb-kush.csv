I had a cold when I tried this in Amsterdam, so that may have caused me to feel the effects of this strain a bit more than most people. After taking a few hits, my body felt super heavy and all of my movements and thoughts seemed to slow. way. down. All I wanted to do was sit in a quite space and nap. While my friend was super hungry after t...”"

The plant is strong and robust, Huge fan leaves with hints of blue and purple a very dark green. The flowers are very dense and compact, Not a big producer but the quality of the flowers is High Grade! It was finished the second week of October here in Northern California, The flowers look great in a jar! Ver dark green with bright red hairs, tons of cr...”"

Like every strain, whenever it hits me I am mostly energetic and hyper and jumping around. 
For most strains these feelings continue to flow throughout the high (the next few hours). 

With Flowerbomb Kush however, this is not exactly the case. 
An Indica high is quite different from a...”"

Bludpoppp,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flowerbomb-kush/reviews/1334557,"“Wow. From the first bowl this strain instantly became my new #1. Super dense hybrid-like buds that are covered in trichromes.. The high hits you fast but the full effects don't set in for a good 10-15 min, however they can last forever. Flowerbomb perfectly incorporates the genetics of it's two parents, green crack and og kush. This is an all day everyday strain, perfect for anxiety and insomnia alike. Not for beginn...”"

ausfire,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flowerbomb-kush/reviews/1147236,"“Tried this at the Greenhouse in Amsterdam last year. Fell in love with the smell and appearance of the flower instantly. The smoke was thick, heavy and very flavourful. Potent as all hell and long lasting so it's definitely more for the seasoned smoker. 10/10 for my all time favourite strain.”"
omonoiaG9UK,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flowerbomb-kush/reviews/1071657,"“On of the best strains ever had! Euphoric and uplifting..it takes you really high, along with the ultimate mellow mood you will ever experience! Highly recomended!”"
verrificus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flowerbomb-kush/reviews/1273505,"“Light head high that gradually escalates to a relaxed euphoria.  Synesthesia effects on skin with light penetration into the muscle beginning about 5-8 minutes into the session.  Very relaxing and calming indica strain with more of a clear focused head high that allows for work.  Great for after work to begin the evening with.”"
littleguru,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flowerbomb-kush/reviews/1278564,"“I was grown and smoked the Flowerbomb Kush.
The cultivation did not really pay off.
The smoke is good. Strong stoned effect. Almost immediately starts to work. Medical level.
The taste is clean, white pepper and lightly spicy ginger. The smell slightly citrusy, slightly anise.
My summary of my assessment: 4/5.”"

A great strain to help people who have a tendency to overthink secondary to anxiety. Once smoked, it has a perfect balance of a sedative-like effect mixed with a mild/moderate cerebral buzz.
