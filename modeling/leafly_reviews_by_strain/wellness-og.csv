Wellness OG
=============
joeydev,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1374631,"‚ÄúMy everyday smoke and I feel lucky for that..  Works beautifully as an anxiety killer and actually gives an amazing body high as well. Not couch locked though, quite the opposite. I feel happy, relaxed, and downright at peace with the Mega Wellness OG. I am blessed living in studio city and having direct access to THE WEED, studio city. I do not work there nor have any relations with anyone whom does. No kickbacks he...‚Äù"
John18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1386992,"‚ÄúHello friendly people. I smoked 1/2 of a joint of Wellness Og 10 minutes ago. I have gathered my wits about me, after a furious blast of THC that was quite pleasant, but I'm glad I wasn't operating heavy equipment for that initial liftoff.  Steady as she goes now though.  Ready to take control of this spacecraft and make corrective action if necessary.
I wrote a very short evaluation of Wellness Og three or four mont...‚Äù"
ogkushlvr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1370573,"‚ÄúI don't know if it is the same strain, but picked up Megawellness Og from Greenwolf in Los Feliz, and it is a must try. you'll start questioning your tolerance because it hits quickly and HARD. Beginners be careful, shit,  veterans be careful. Lives up to the hype, watch.‚Äù"
ahrenberger25,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1369268,"‚ÄúI'm an Indica guy myself, so this is one hell of a badass head-high with just enough body action to keep me comfortable. VERY STRONG, piney and hash flavors. Off-the-charts potency, not for beginners!

Feels a lot like smoking concentrate, with all the gaps filled in. Truly award-winning.‚Äù"
JediForce,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1305753,"‚ÄúWhat a great tasting smoke!  Smooooth!  I got a nice head high followed by a full body buzz and lasted for hours!‚Äù"
BaronOfBud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1191430,"‚ÄúSativa-dominant cup winning hybrid from The WEED in Studio City, kind of a creep but hits hard with crushing euphoria and a dream-like state, like being caught in a state of half-consciousness. Covered in trichomes and very heavy.‚Äù"
JOHNNYBL8ZE503,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1411146,"‚ÄúThe Wellness OG does give off that piney, kushy, just lovely aroma & is quite strong in effects. But not a total "couch lock" it is a very "happy" type strain for me anyways. It just gives me that warm, overall good feeling that good cannabis gives me (especially OG). Nice dense buds too & just like the description says it is sticky & my sample was completely CAKED in trichomes. Definitely a strain to pick up if u se...‚Äù"
WayOutWest,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1369284,"‚ÄúAs other reviewers have noted, this right here is the real deal.

Smell: louder than Neil Young's Crazy Horse rig feeding back inside the grand canyon.

Flavor: Pillowy puffs of pine and fuel finish with a Sprite/7Up tingle of sweetness of the lips.

Effects: one hit launches you skyward, like one of those catapult rides outside a gaudy Vegas hotel. After liftoff evens out, expect a super relaxing body buzz that numb...‚Äù"

cpierce0422,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1263294,"‚ÄúSo far so good. Super happy. Sky is vibrant. I posted the same pic and caption twice on here because I forgot immediately after I did it. The people that review the pics probably get that a lot, though. Also pretty chatty at the moment. I think it took me an hour to write this, but I can't be sure.‚Äù"

Wouldn't mind smoking this my whole life.‚Äù"
BaronOfBud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1227244,"‚ÄúThe popcorn structured nugs of this strain are compact, but not overly dense, with darker green coloring, and an abundance of hidden trichomes. The trichs themselves are hidden within the compact nugs, but once broken open you can see the intricate trichomes structure within. The aroma is an INTENSE lemon diesel fuel scent with a sweet twist to it, with the flavor leaning heavily towards that classic tasty lemon dies...‚Äù"

Holy Shit‚Äù"
wolaf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1665335,"‚ÄúYes please.  This is what Og kush should be.  My eigth from NoHo's finest was one big nug.  Perfect manicure and oh so sticky.  Being from Az the stickiness was appreciated.  The smell of this is an Og lovers dream.  Pine, fuel, lemons more pine.  Like a fresh cut golf course.  On inhale you get a real nice kick of the same flavors you smell with a deep woody or nutty flavor.  The taste of this is what sets it apart....‚Äù"
TheLandOfGanja,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wellness-og/reviews/1632729,"‚ÄúThis strain is some strong stuff. Do not underestimate it. Go slow with this one and don‚Äôt overdo it. Gave me some anxiety because I did too much, I should have stopped after a couple of hits. Also experienced serious couch-lock, couldn‚Äôt feel my legs for a while, no pain and complete euphoria mixed with some slight paranoia lol trust me you will trip. Good strain but I‚Äôd go light on it.‚Äù"
