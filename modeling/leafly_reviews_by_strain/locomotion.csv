Locomotion
=============
ubercooljaimie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/locomotion/reviews/1410071,"“It's a very awake indica that leads you down rabbit holes of creativity. It's a social high, yet it's nice to just chill alone with too. Overall it's a very euphoric high. It doesn't give you mad munchies , but salty sunflower seeds are perfect snack.”"
JDriver,https://www.leafly.com/indica/locomotion/reviews/1391940,"“I honestly think this should be classified as a hybrid. For me it provides a perfect balance to the cerebral high and the full body relaxation. The taste is a sweet earthy diesel. Strong sour diesel aroma. Overall the high comes quick and then mellows out. I didn't get sleepy which I was hoping for. It would be a nice strain to have around after a long work day to relax but not be out asleep 1hr later. Perhaps if you...”"

iameka,https://www.leafly.com/indica/locomotion/reviews/1415226,"“DAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMNNNNNN!!! This is a strong indica providing extreme euphoric high, couch-lock-stone! I was staring at the wall for I don't know how long before my friend knocked me out of it. Relaxes my pains and stress.”"

Helped my racing thoughts/hypomania by unlocking the creativity that's been caged in there. My only complaint is the dry mouth, but, it is soooooo worth it!”"

AreaMan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/locomotion/reviews/1549568,"“Note to self: do not smoke this strain again when you have anything you need to accomplish. Taking a few draws of this on the Pax was like ordering a Bud and then realizing you'd drunk a Bigfoot. VERY high-school like buzz, felt a bit silly. Peaked in about 45 minutes, then hung there for an hour or so. Came home and listened to the radio for a bit, which was where this strain really hit its stride. Very nice groove ...”"

Move on over the locomotion is coming through! With a unique fruity and fuely taste this strain will keep on going for a long-lasting high. Sour smelling complimented by hints of fruits and a pungent skunkiness on the nose. Locomotion makes you talk, along with giving you a euphoric relaxing happy high that does unfortunately come with a note dry mouth (which is worth the relaxation)...”"

akstonerchick,https://www.leafly.com/indica/locomotion/reviews/1545591,"“Right when you smell this strain you can pick up the diesel smell. Definitely wrap it well because it will smell up wherever you're ate before smoking. That being said the smoke is heady and potent. I've had this in every form. Flower, shatter and kief. It will relax you and help with pain. I get an excellent nights sleep. A dab of this is strong enough to last me four or five hours. It's really tasty and makes you f...”"

LesClaymore,https://www.leafly.com/indica/locomotion/reviews/1635972,"“LM has a very pleasant high: medium-level, whole-body euphoria, which is just slightly eclipsed by its relaxing, narcotic-type effects. I can function very, very well externally—while under a blanket of internal peace and happiness. 

LM definitely feels Indica-leaning, but it’s not too sedative (at least for my high tolerance).

Mxoxtxo97,https://www.leafly.com/indica/locomotion/reviews/1395681,"“Strain is very powerful. I am a veteran smoker and a couple rips and this stuff gets me toasted. Some pros: Euphoric, happy,  great for being social. Some cons: made my heart race (more then I think I ever had off of any other strain), Paranoia. Been smoking it steady for a few days and it is the same outcome every toke.”"
KawaiiStoner,https://www.leafly.com/indica/locomotion/reviews/1365111,"“I really like this strain. It's a smooth high and perfect if you want to still be productive, a great day smoke for sure. Also a little really does go a long way, which is always awesome 😊”"
CaptainQuazar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/locomotion/reviews/1778092,"“Locmoton from Ilera was very average. Really, I can't think of much to say about it. It had an OK relaxing effect on the body that eased pain. Gave me an odd sense of "time warp", time slowed down, didn't see to be passing at all. Name seems a little bit off because the last thing I wanted to do was the Locomotion. Paired adequately with Better Call Saul.”"
