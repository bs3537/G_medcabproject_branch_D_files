Terrific green, fresh outdoor flavor with a subtle frosty terpene aroma down to the nodes. Great fresh taste with fluffy buds that breaks up well in wooden grinder. 

Definitely a clear sativa smoke that does sneak up on you for a waking head rush. I medicate for anxiety issues which clouds my concentration and spikes my fatigue.

MDCRP,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck/reviews/1371235,"‚ÄúVaping this strain is pretty perfect if you're looking for a happy mellow high. If you're tired it will definitely make you more tired‚Äù"

Bubbistars,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck/reviews/1370195,"‚ÄúI thought this was an excellent strain! It was actually the first time I've smoked marijuana in years and years. I took it to see if it relieved the daily chronic pain that plaques me on a daily non-stop basis. I wasn't able to even take more than 3 tokes at the most. I didn't care for the way it made me have brief coughing fits. Why that happened, I've no idea. 
Train wreck without a doubt certainly made me have fun...‚Äù"

shelbikate,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trainwreck/reviews/1736779,"‚ÄúAnother one of my TOP 3 FAVORITE STRAINS. This is not a strain for beginners. This bud makes all of your senses heighten like your hearing and sight. Might feel like a subtle acid trip & could lead to paranoia if prone to it. However, it makes everything more intense & brightens your surroundings. Keeps you alert. Great if you like to work out after smoking.‚Äù"

Last Holiday season my friend is throwing a kid-friendly get-together. My kid and I are getting ready to roll over. I got the cartridge and blast off.
