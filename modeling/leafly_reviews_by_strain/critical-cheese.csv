deerproblem,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-cheese/reviews/1383688,"“As someone who has a hard time with more stimulating strains this was the perfect amount without causing me anxiety. I really like cheese for the light sativa effects, while retaining the warmth of an indica.”"
Jomt1234,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-cheese/reviews/1390720,"“This is really a great strain if you feel like you wanna be active, out walking or just partying. It smells very sweet, like some candy, and it got a mild taste, which is bushy and just, tastes like traditional weed. 
I'm at an 9/10 now from this, so yeah :D”"

Musicaddict02,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-cheese/reviews/1218062,"“Really nice looking . Smell got me uplifted right away . Usually I need more indica ish hybrids to better manage my mood since sativa tend to make me more anxious , but this one got me feeling giddy.

TheBigGreenGiant,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-cheese/reviews/1219314,"“Bought this cheap so thought it was going to be just the mellow type. Was surprised when I first smoked it and the affect it had on me and some pals. Two joints worth and it hits you hard. However, just having the right amounts presses the buttons as you can be energetic of small doses. Very smooth on the throat too.”"

maddogdave,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-cheese/reviews/1312660,"“Good bud from the smoking perspective.
As far as growing this strain it tends to be weak with fox-tailing in the last couple of weeks of flower.

Look at greenhouse cheese or even better DR Krippling IncredibleBulk.
You won't regret it.”"

Definite anxiety and stress reliever; makes you feel lighter (less tense muscles, less pressure on you as a whole).

El_Chad,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-cheese/reviews/1281834,"“Muy buena cepa, una combinación de muy rico sabor y un muy buen pegue. El sabor tiene un inconfundible dejo de Cheese, pero no necesariamente super marcado. El pegue es muy bueno, bien de Sativa, personalmente mis favoritas.
Si bien no llego a entrar en la categoría de "las mejores que fumé" tampoco se quedó tan lejos, una cepa más que recomendable.”"
