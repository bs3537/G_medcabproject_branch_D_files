Lucid Dream

themisterspider,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucid-dream/reviews/1417506,"“My friends have started to jokingly refer to this strain as "Crybaby Weed" because just about every time I have it I start to tear up and get emotional. Some context: I'm a 30 yr old dude who is highly analytical and lives mainly in his head. Lucid Dream, for whatever reason, helps me live in my heart and feel all of the things that are typically stuffed down during my waking life. I gotta say, getting in touch with ...”"
Munchiez2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucid-dream/reviews/1410924,"“really good looking resinous buds, very thick trichomes and terrific smell. The taste sides with the smell for the sweet smooth flavor as well which just makes it even better. This stuff killed me a bowl in and put me into a 4 hour nap, plus lucid dreams, and a super dreamy and crazy buzz. I will be buying this strain again as soon as possible”"

CosmicOwl420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucid-dream/reviews/1388457,"“This review is based off the Lucid Dream from Tru|med in Phoenix which had perfect textbook nugs. This sativa dominate hybrid is a unique strain. It has a combination of the uplifting blue dream high but is overpowered by the racy haze genetics. a definite daytime strain for creative projects but would not recommend for morning use as it is a bit too frenetic to focus on singular tasks. This strain has aphrodisiac ef...”"
stephenmblack1982,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucid-dream/reviews/1388454,"“This is one of the truly magical strains that puts Tru|Med so far above any other dispensary in the Phoenix area. Their Blue Dream has achieved legendary status and this creation takes that sweet blueberry candy skunky funky goodness and takes it up another 5 notches.

First off, this stuff is LOUD. When you open the bag you'll immediately know you've got something special.

Then you take that first hit... you'll tas...”"

After a joint by my self. Watched some football. Right when half time started I realized “tripping out” I couldn’t feel my body. I felt like i was on clouds. Just floating not weight peaceful. 30 sec after realizing how comfy I was......  BAMMM!!!!!💥💥💥knocked the fcksssss outssssss 😴😵 K.O!   I d...”"
becjenn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucid-dream/reviews/1585741,"“This strain sneaks up on you. In the first minutes or so, you don't really feel anything, but 5 minutes later you feel the creep. First effect I notice is that it hit the very tips of my fingers and then my eyelids. I get a vibrating numbness throughout my entire body. For a few moments, I slip into a pleasant lethargy. My mind is slower but I still move from thought to thought as I lose concentration. 30 minutes lat...”"

jharris480,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucid-dream/reviews/1291423,"“I smoke a decent amount of herb and have for quite awhile so my tolerance is up there. This is my favorite Sativa dominant.... hands down. You get the energetic high from the Amnesia Haze and the euphoric high from the Blue Dream all together in one. I think this is one of the best Sativa dominant strains out there right now”"
NavyVet420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucid-dream/reviews/1388453,"“I waited and waited until Tru|Med in Phoenix had it ready. And it was worth the wait. The combo of Blue Dream with its haze like qualities and its distinctive Blueberry flavor added to Amnesia Haze make this a very nice, potent daytime strain for the experienced user. The flavor profile on the inhale through my Extreme Q were of Berries, Apple, Pineapple and Tropical Fruits, scent of vapor was just as pleasant. The c...”"

High is uplifting, happy, and intense, but encourages productivity.  As a person who is prone to paranoia and anxiety from sativas and sativa-dominant hybrids, this strain caused no paranoia or anxiety.  Great for someone who experiences depression and lack of motivation.”"
