Powerfully balanced Landrace Hybrid, apparently hard to come by but it made it's way down to sunny San Diego, CA. All Natural, All Organic, Cultivated with no bottled nutrients, Flowered 12 weeks.”"
oasinocean,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-one/reviews/1347495,"“Interesting mental high, classic indica couch lock. With this one I would recommend some trippy music and just wind down while your mind wanders.”"
dingus611,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-one/reviews/1282416,"“The most unique smelling canna I've ever smelled. More potent than any fad strain with unique landrace pedigree. It hasn't been watered down with generations of hybridizing and Dutch genetics. It's truly an heirloom, frozen in time clone only.”"
2jinka,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-one/reviews/1507078,"“Zen Euphoria ends in a great body high for a good night sleep. The One is my favorite strain to date, to unwind. No matter how long or hectic my day has been a couple hits sends me into happy relaxation, to enjoy conversation, read, etc., and then nod off to sleep without aches and pains.”"
popsmoke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-one/reviews/1208882,"“Such a smooth high that it feels so natural. Super uplifting and creativity inducing effects. I'd burn it on a gloomy day.”"
hotdiggitydank,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-one/reviews/1711018,"“Picture if you will a cold evening when you just got home from work. Many may have a couple of drinks to wind down before diner. Well, make a crock pot meal get out of those work clothes and enjoy this strain. The one that I have is actually  deemed indica dominant and the thc level is lower  (11 to 12%). Anyway, it is not overwhelming but a good mellow so if you have to do something at the end of the day that is rea...”"
Broesph11,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-one/reviews/1710560,"“I smoked a raw cone of this stuff. The fluffy buds were bright green with orange hairs. Along with good appearance there was a piney smell and earthy and sweet flavor. It left me with an overall happy feeling, along with a permasmile. I have depression so for me it puts me in a better mood.”"

PattonWilhelmJori,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-one/reviews/1299814,"“Okay yeah hit this too much in the beginning you will not get it again... but, let it mellow within you and all is ok. Use it sparingly unless you are hardcore cuz it's some good sh** but can't give it 5. Body high might mess with you combined with the mind high. If you're new to smoking, try starting with something else... Just sayin'. But a good smoke and true to it's Leafly stasis... the leaf never lies.”"

tanson1011,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-one/reviews/1291000,"“buds were small and very sticky. very pungent smell. broke up very well and "fluffy". smooth to smoke and tasted quite sweet. Didn't take much for the buzz to kick in. was surprised how hard and fast the high hit. felt happy, energetic at first then felt relaxed. but not too relaxed. smoked just before a wedding where I didn't know anyone but my date, and felt super relaxed and easy going. where usually I'd be nervou...”"
supercabby1975,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-one/reviews/1376578,"“Nice to see some out west weed made it to the Ann Arbor area. My delivery guy brought me a 1/8 and a few doors. Took me five days to smoke it all. Talk about bang for ya buck. First landrace strains I have smoked. I did have some Thai stick back in the day. Bad ass bud. Relaxed for sure.”"

Trichome.fields,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-one/reviews/1320429,"“Very beautiful plant indeed, was a pleasure to grow. As well as somewhat of an honor.  Very resinous, straight fumes, pungent almost sulphuric odor with a good amount of sweetness in there. That's my take on taste. Grown in Hawaii.”"

Had my sample in the morning and it quickly provided a euphoric head change that gradually settled into a calmer more relaxing energy with mild body relaxation. Great strain to start the day.”"
