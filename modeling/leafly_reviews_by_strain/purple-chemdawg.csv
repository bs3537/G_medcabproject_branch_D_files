Did I mention this strain took 1st place indica at the Hightimes Cannabis Cup. From the dispensary @ SouthCoast CareGivers, #1 in Massachusetts. They ARE THE BEST!!!  So grab some Purple Chem for a weekend of rest & relaxation.  ♡♡♡&Peace....”"

Relaxing but doesn't make you "sleepy" ..Oh no wait, the sleepiness is kicking in. Smells and tastes phenomenal.

Very relaxing, great body high and just enough head high to keep you spacey. I've been sick for a couple weeks and this shit has made me almost forget I was after. Helped my achy neck and back as well as nausea”"
llloyd,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-chemdawg/reviews/1210940,"“This one's a creeper.  Relaxed and euphoric, a nice way to wind down a few hours before bed.  Good for creative activities as well as enjoying comics, movies, music etc.

Typical high starts out fun and has a smooth transition to relaxation with little side effects even for those (me) who are sensitive to paranoia prone strains.”"

I haven't had such a strong indica in a long time and this strain almost had analgesic properties to it. It smells like grape juicy zebra stripe gum flavor and heaven. Admirable strain 9.8/10”"
Berrypopsix,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-chemdawg/reviews/1479996,"“What an awesome indica! Vaped through a stash of this and couldn’t get enough. The purple flavor tones are deep and delicious followed by a smooth chem aftertone. This strain will definitely take you into relaxation mode. I would not recommend this strain for daytime use unless you plan on binge watching all day, late afternoon to evening and you can ride this sweet high into bed. 
I really didn’t expect this strain ...”"
jeahisaidit,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-chemdawg/reviews/1329385,"“Wooof, Wooof, Woof! The purple chemdawg barks is as bad as it's bite. This wondeful medicine helped my MS forget what it usually does to me (read: kick my ass) This medicine has the holy trifecta to help treat my MS - pain, stress and anxiety. A wonderful medley of sweet flavored flowers, the chemdawg is definitely atomic. The medicine lasted about 3 hours once vaporized.”"

Then moves to the body with a punch.  I wouldn't say it was a total couch lock though as I have no problem smoking this before going out. What I love about this strain is its ability to bring you to the same level every time.  Perfect for those everyday smokers with a high tolerance to THC.”"

Chunkdawg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-chemdawg/reviews/1751714,"“My first strain while being a MMJ patient was indeed, Purple Chemdawg. Boasting a high 27.2% THC percentage, I bought it quickly. Flavor notes are somewhat berry-like, with a smooth exhale. It was a body high, but I was told it would fight my insomnia. Very relaxing feeling, but not sleepy. Instead of laying in my bed, I was stretching (for some reason) and pain-free. Highly recommend for those who battle chronic pai...”"

I bought it in a cartridge pen and I believed cartridge pens weren’t that strong due to my tolerance. Took a few hits while working on some homework and then BOOM it all hit me at once. This was springily very hallucinogenic for me because the numbers and words on my paper starting shifting around and I saw what looked like cartoon eyes staring at my in all ...”"

Flavor is a bit odd with a sharp artificial grape aftertaste mixed with the strong flavor of pungent herb (think some really dank weed with a hint of grape laffy taffy).
Relaxing music is a defini...”"

I felt creative and carefree.  The flavour of this strain is sweet, probably from the Granddaddy Purple, with a light chemically flavoured undertone.    The aroma has a clear grape scent with an overpowering deisel smell asl well.   This is a nice daytime strain although not a heavy hitter if you need to c...”"
