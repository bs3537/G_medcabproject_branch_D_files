It has an aroma of citrus and cat urine/ammonia. Very high odor, even in my top dresser drawer the entire second floor reeked of bud. Glass vials a must when transporting or storing. Fast acting strain, was completely stoned within a few minutes. Main effect is a serious case of the tinglies. A very pleasant experience. However, be...”"

PhillyLove,https://www.leafly.com/indica/orange-kush/reviews/1367014,"“Orange Kush is a creeper that works magic for those stressed out days, & gives the body a loose feel that stays with you, giving an awesome deep sleep. 
Buds are HUGE, kinda like Big Buds strain, with the hairs giving it the appearance that its a juicy orange delight. 
The smell & taste overall have a mellow citrus, not like lemon stains and carries a heavy aroma that could make you drool. 
Again don't be fooled, it ...”"

Minimal couch lock, so you can still operate in public and have a good time. Euphoria came on strong in the beginning but that could have just been excitement for a new Star Wars.”"

I was not fair in my first review. I was already high and the Haze Berry and Orange Kush high combo got really overwhelming. Really nice high that hits very euphoric at the beginning to then let you in a mellow mood that leaves you weirdly energized, leaving not buzz at all. Daytime indica, to keep it cool all day in a nice mood but also in a productive mood. also nice for going social”"

It has a nice citrusy taste as one might expect with some spice.  It's mellow, heady buzz is just short of feeling paranoia (i.e.; none) and it's body relaxing fuzz with waves of warmth.  I love it.  *Highly recommended.*”"
