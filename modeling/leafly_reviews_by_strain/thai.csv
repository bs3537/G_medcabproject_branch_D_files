TokinTravels,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thai/reviews/1414154,"“I'm just going to tell a little story about this stain in its natural habitat. 

This past January I was doing some work on a tiny island off the coast of Malaysia, quite close to the Thai border. I didn't think I'd be smoking at all since I didn't have any connections and drugs carry such a stiff penalty (life in jail or execution!) but luckily for me, the native islander I was working for was quite the affianado. h...”"

It is really cheap compared to skunk and strong marijuana, i got 7g for £25; almost a 3rd of the price of skunk.  The best smelling cannabis ever! Smells herby and not to pungent.

pros:
nice body high 
nice head
equally even

It soared up into my brain pretty quickly. It's a strong head high that would have been great at a party, but I was just trying it out while glued to my laptop one night.

I London we get alot of Thai brick weed, which has some seeds and sticks in it. The appearance is awful and the smell is not very strong.

Intensity level of THC: also four stars, and it stays with you and if anything increases for a while. Fruity aroma and a pleasant taste, though milder than I expected. A nice nostalgic strain that really stood out (with a few others) decades ago, and now is one of thrillions of fine ganjas. Thrillions.”"

Did leaving me somewhat Paranoid. Coughed a few times off a few rips.”"
