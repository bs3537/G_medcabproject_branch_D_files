Energetic and giggly. Tons of fun in groups. A friend who usually finds more paranoia while smoking than anything else said this was "the most enjoyable" strain he had tried. Depression and anxiety are gone on this one. A favorite for me!”"

Mr.Rob,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-jack/reviews/1389420,"“What happens when you cross 2 world class Sativas? You get this oh so sweet and piney Sour Jack. The smell and taste are incredible. There’s sweet, piney, and diesel all going on at the same time. Great heady uplifting effects that just puts you in a good mood. Recommended for depression, minor aches and pain, stress relief, and thought provoking creativity. Keeps the mind busy.”"

On pain wise it helped me relax and concentrate on what I have to do through put the day. 
Great mix that created sour jack one of the greatest strains I've had.”"

After an hour or so this Sativa turned into a strong Indica. Sheep in wolves clothing. Great high though. Grab some food and Netflix.

Gives you some giggles but it's mainly a strain that kept me in a good mood 

Taste was definitely a diesel taste 

Really good strain”"
