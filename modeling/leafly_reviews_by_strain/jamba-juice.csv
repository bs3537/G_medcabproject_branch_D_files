JediForce,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jamba-juice/reviews/1482150,"“This is a brand new strain for me. First time I had the opportunity to try it. Sure does not disappoint.  Nice cerebral and body high. Very focused and uplifted.  It has an interesting sweet diesel taste.  Nice bright green bud covered in white tricomes.  A true one hit wonder!

Good for watching TV or hanging out with friends without feeling too stoned. Didn’t make me sleepy at all but took the edge off of stress.”"
