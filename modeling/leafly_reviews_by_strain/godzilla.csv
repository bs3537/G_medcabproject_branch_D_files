BudDozer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1412037,"“A total sedative. Not only does it take my back pain away, it makes me feel so light I forget I even have a body. I smoke a little more and enjoy the fall into a nice oblivion-like sleep. 

Do not imbibe if you want to be productive after. This is what you smoke to forget the world.”"
BonBon18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1415498,"“This is my first time with this strain . I suffer from anxiety and insomnia . So far it does relax me I do get a little anxious for awhile but it's not horrible .”"
Blackwatch09,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1463697,"“The review warned of the crushing euphoria and I think that---
....how'd I get outside?”"
trustthetrey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1235174,"“this strain is dank, super pungent to me. the nugs are nice and when you hit it, it hits harder, very strong and potent”"
tomlebong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1364823,"“Great for demolishing a pizza in bed with a movie on. Quality chill-out strain.”"
TheLandOfGanja,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1542474,"“I don't taste the berry, flower flavor in Godzilla. I taste earthy, citrusy, lemon flavors. It's a good indica, relaxing body sedation, yet clear-headed. Don't let the name intimidate you. Regular indica users will find this one soft as a kitten. Smooth taste and comforting. You'll want to curl up with a good book with this one.”"
dylanm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1247247,"“Godzilla is a heavy indica strain that sedates you while allowing euphoria and happiness to dance through the muscular system. Allows you to be a great medium between sleepy and energetic. Slows you down and makes you productive!”"
Tdro420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1153684,"“Bought an 1/8 of Godzilla earlier today, it costs 50$ but it was worth it, very diesel/berry smell and buds looked amazing, on inhale it had a very distict diesel taste and on exhale tasted like blueberries, very smooth high, heavy body and head high, it keeps me blazed for 4 hours after just a bowl”"

CleanBandit,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1181458,"“This was a strain I had to get used to. Definite hints of indica bodywise, with a sativa finish that basically makes your body relaxed and mind sharp as a tack. 

Perfect while relaxing with friends or before a social event. Makes you uninhibited, appreciative and totally chill.

A very sweet, almost biscuity smell sometimes when burned.”"
dukeyflywatter,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1252615,"“After hearing the good reviews and being a fan of Godzilla movies for fifty years I was eager to try this. Was pretty disappointed and expecting some wreckage from this beast but alas. The first couple of times it was a good high but certainly not worthy of it's name sake. It was OK for by bi-polar needs but only cut my back pain in half. I got it on sale so on that level I'm not griping because it's decent for cheap...”"

SeaWarpRoy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1671657,"“I’ve been picking this up quite a bit recently and I must say that I’m more impressed each time. Very very dense nugs, mostly sweet smelling with a hint of gas to it. The trichomes are all over and it’s a really sticky strain. Definitely a heavy indica and proud to be a BC special :)”"

Godzilllllla,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1699307,"“A godsend from the big monster himself, Godzilla hits like a motherfucking beefed up King Ghidorah on magical thundercrack. Fucking couched for days and feasted like an unfed family of baby chimpanzees. Be sure to prepare yourself to be anally fisted by Mothra herself while having an inner existentialcrisis about school and your future. 10/10 would fucking do again. Pepper your anguses for this one guys, cause it’s y...”"
Hendertucky,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1285318,"“So far the best strain for my insomnia. creeping relaxing body effect puts you right to sleep.”"
brandonwilson,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1301959,"“purple ammonia!”"
musicwizard,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1388442,"“This stuff gave me a really "out-there" trip for the first 20 minutes or so that wasn't entirely pleasant, but then it leveled off and was pretty nice. It was a little unpredictable for me, sometimes it would give me tons of energy and sometimes it would make me sleepy. I would recommend this strain to those who like surprises. It did taste pretty good to smoke and it did totally kill a migraine.”"
zacharyd3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1447194,"“Pretty solid high, however, I have anxiety issues so I try to stay away from any strains that cause too much anxiety or paranoia. I find the high is a good just zone out and chill kinda high but if I do too much at once I get pretty paranoid. So good but in small doses is the best way to summarize in my best opinion.”"
brandonwilson,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1301960,"“Purple and  smelly.”"

UDtheAesir,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1142805,"“Godzilla is a helluva weed. It takes you really into your mind and makes you over-analyze each and every one of your thoughts. So much to the point your thoughts repeat themselves in varying tempos. It lasts a very long time as the high goes on.

Overall a great weed for helping you understand and upgrade your mental processes.”"
MGlock,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1263112,"“Get ready to sit down when you sample this strain. True indica”"
bakari.burton,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1357958,"“Godzilla OG has just the right amount of strength to keep you up and going. From the looks of the frosty leafs, big trichromes, and tight rock buds, you can tell this bud is nice and tasty. I completed some exercises on the floor after a .6 joint. The effects lasted all day til I got off home from work. This is some fire a MUST for long time smokers.”"

c1n1m1n,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godzilla/reviews/1388443,"“This gives a horrible dry mouth that never ends, I will never ever get this strain ever again. Of all the weed strains I've tried I have never had dry mouth so bad.”"
