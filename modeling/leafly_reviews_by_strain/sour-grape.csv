The body high obtained from this strain works well and will assist with relaxing or naturally falling asleep.

Strain is approximately 50/50, but the cerebral high effects are definitely more noticeable than the body. Up in the head you get a strange, lifting feeling that kicks in after a minute or two. After that it's smooth sailing for an hour or two. In the body, I've experienced an odd, sort of "rolling" high that you can sort of fee...”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-grape/reviews/1344165,"“Good mild sour grape flavor seems to be a fairly potent strain. 
I don’t know the thc content but it must be pretty potent, since I smoke often and these meds got the job done quick. 
The Good: Mild sativa like head high, euphoric, increased appetite, talkative, energetic, and also makes your body numb. This strain could probably be a good one for mild and maybe moderate pain. 
The Bad: Increased anxiety, paranoia...”"

You can accomplish evening household tasks before you plop down on the couch.  Not particularly euphoric. Relaxing and pleasant.”"

Unfortunately, sometimes it seems to amplify my anxiety, but I feel like most of what I've smoked lately has had the same effect, so maybe it's just my GAD/social anxiety being untreated, and not the weed? 

Anyway, this tastes grape-y and smells dank.”"

KnowledgeFromThe5Percent,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-grape/reviews/1351759,"“This strain varies greatly in all areas. Since it's a cross between a strong indica and sativa. There are always mixed batches of sour grape with either sativa or indica dominance. However when you can find that perfect 50/50 mix. In my opinion, is one of the best strains ever. It is exceptional in all respects.”"
