Feels like I walked into a wall face-first...I can feel the physical impact on my cheeks and forehead. Haha. Weird. Head is extremely floaty and fuzzed out. Stupefying stoniness, my hole body slumps in relaxation. There’s a permanent island of clarity in there somewhere that maintains 30% functionality. Can kind of focus and concentrate, but the ability drops off quickly and you hav...”"

Most of these reviews mentioned the strain making them sleepy and drowsy, however the Blue Ivy made me feel energetic and high spirited. It gave me the urge to want to clean my whole apartment, as well as gave me an appetite to eat 3 chili dogs immediately after. Different strokes for different folks I suppose. Make sure you guys visit 661 medical. They are ...”"

(I smoke ALOT so this was very surprising.) I felt super happy and on top of the world. Energized. Clear head high. Highly recommend!”"

The strain was pretty good compared to some of the other strains that Ive had from other local Kern County Dispensaries. The $55 donation is a bit steep for an 8th, but if you have that much to spare it is well worth it!...”"

Strongest strain I've had, heard the same from a dispensary owner. Took me almost an hour to smoke two bowls because I forgot what I was doing after the first and was just standing there thinking of what I was going to do next while lost in a continually chain of though...”"

yw84fun,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-ivy/reviews/1084729,"“This strain was marked as a Sativa at the dispensary from where I purchased it. It clearly had the properties of a good Sativa with great head effects and virtually no body effects. You have lots of energy with this strain. The clean high came on quickly, peaking at around 10-15 minutes and stayed level for 2 hours followed by a slow comedown of about an hour. Felt very uplifted and mildly euphoric. The taste was rem...”"

Hits you in the head an yr like taken off guard not expecting it to be as strong as it is. then it creeps down yr body. It just feels really good like a good med should. 
I really wish i knew the genetics. Ive yet to find out. Only thing is how blah blah it was named after Jay z and beyonces baby. STUPID. 
Anyway if you f...”"

When they advertised the strain over Twitter via @661Medical, I rushed down there at 11pm to try a gram. The strain has a pungent OG smell that intoxicates your nose at first whiff. The color of the strain is dark green with traces of orange hairs on the buds (picture provided). When I asked the bud tenders at 661 wha...”"
