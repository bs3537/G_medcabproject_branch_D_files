And even though there was no couch lock I was pretty relaxed. i smoked it once before & was not as impressed but THC was almost 10% higher in this one, probably why. Anyways, good mood booster for sure!!! :]”"

However not high enough where I’m zoned out in Bobs Burgers , I still surfed to see what else was on. Good strain that I’d honestly get if my go to is sold out . However end of day it’s not the same .”"
