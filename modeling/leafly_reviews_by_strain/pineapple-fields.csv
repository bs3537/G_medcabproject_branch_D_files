Bud structure is perfect! -aroma, density, moisture, and it's quite an easy smoke. Excellent flavor, altho def more 🍍-aroma than 🍍-taste, & nary a fruity hint at all, which surprises me bc pretty decent (8+) terp-profile. Pretty earthy, smooth flavor, altho this particular strain is pretty generic-tasting, which would pr...”"

This will forever be on my list and in my stash!!😉😉😎”"
ms_indica93,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1391825,"“Not a hard hitting high, but you do notice a difference pretty much right away. Great for social occasions and playing some video games. Nice and clear headed and you really notice a high when you stand up and try and walk around lol. And it's tastes and smells GREAT. Recommend to all”"

It's a bit surprising, however, bc the AROMA of flower 🌺 was amazing, but TASTE was NIL — which is contrary to this beautifully- 🍊-in-color oil brings...”"
GMDuke,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1553857,"“Right from the start I knew this was going to be a good strain. Known as Zainavir here in CT, that first wiff of sweet, tropical, fruity buds was key. The flavor continued as a smooth draw, left your palate wanting more. 'Invigorating' is the best word for the effects it leaves you with, keeping you focused, and making any task more enjoyable. This batch tested at 26% THCA, & 1.2% CBGA, for those of us with glaucoma.”"
DemonicSymphony,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1379555,"“This strain is excellent for day time pain relief. It has a sweet, tropical taste to it. Though the taste comes through much, much more when vaping versus smoking. When smoking, I get a vague sweet tropical taste. When vaping, I actually get a heavy pineapple, which is really pleasant.

Love this, really appreciate what it's doing for my pain levels and how much it's allowing me to function again.”"
jdrotten,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1387967,"“This strain is my go to! Theraplant did a fantastic job with this one the flower is good but their shatter was amazing fruity sweet tasting profile with a hint of pineapple that crushes depression doesn't induce anxiety yet let's you function through out the day with a nice mellow euphoria.”"
MHWirtschafter,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1379557,"“very flavorful , quite beneficial for my pain mgmt during the day or early evening.”"
firefly887,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1535074,"“Smoking Pineapple Fields (Zainavir) prerolls from Theraplant. At first this one didn’t stand out to me particularly— it’s a slightly cerebral high with just enough focus to get some things done, curbs depression, gets you feeling a little talkative and silly. Then I realized this strain (to me) feels just like how the high was when I first started smoking when I was younger. It’s hard to overdo it with this and it’s ...”"
PaulWisener,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1532284,"“Absolutely amazing taste and smelled delicious! Really mellow buzz on the sativa side, great for social gathering or a nooner... Was in the high twenties on thc. Colors are vibrant, with yellow and orange hairs. Nice dense nuggs, very pleased.”"
mcjanerson,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1605016,"“First off this smells soooo good!! Citrus, pineapple, and that diesel mixed together. I’d wear it as a perfume. The flavor is carried over when it’s smoked. Rolled myself a little joint cuz I’m waiting for my piece to come in the mail but I couldn’t resist how good it smells. Felt a nice sense of relaxation and my pain level was decreasing. I’m going back for more!”"
buddwyer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1412176,"“Very intense cerebral high. Slight pressure at the temples. Gets me very stoned without heavy sedation. oUt has a fruity inhale and even tastier exhale. Grade A on taste. But the high of this strain can either intensify my anxiety or make me forget about it, which is why I give 4 stars. But overall some great bud to smoke after a long day of work or if you're stressing.”"
hotdiggitydank,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1433516,"“I concur with what many have said..great morning strain and a great way to battle depression. Im going hiking soon after having this strain in a tincture. Great for vaping in the morning and great for when you are about to do it!”"
batman87,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1475875,"“Love this strain for when I got a killer migraine coming on a few hits and my neck and head are clear of pain. Good strain for getting shit done too. Highly recommend it.”"
XpectResistance,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1595699,"“Great for wake n bake purposes. Fantastic way to get your day started. I usually follow with a microdose of pure CBD/Indica to take the anxious edge off. The onset can be stifling if you're not aware of it but it can easily be shaken off. Otherwise, its an awesome, clean and very energetic high. There is a body aspect to it that can be quite intense at times, depending on dosage. Tingly and goosebumps followed by a f...”"

tlultuce,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1355112,"“One of my favorites in flavor, this truly has a great pineapple flavor. Very tasty and smells so good. Buds were cured to absolute perfection! A strong high, too much will be too much but just a little is all you need! The flavor is truly incredible. Little tired on the comedown, but mentally feeling great even after its over.”"
buddwyer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1412178,"“Very strong stoney feeling with very little sedation. It can either make my anxiety intensify or make me forget about my problems. that's why I give it 4 stars. But overall great Sativa.”"
ku98,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1494589,"“Pretty good smoke. Smells and tastes amazing. Nugs are frosted to hell with a sticky texture (even being grown in the CO dry climate). Hits you in the head and behind the eyes. Pretty good for a wake and bake.”"
PineappleScott,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1569628,"“Your typical sativa here. A slightly more active high. This is right on the borderline of " Wake and Bake " strain and " I just wanna get high " strain. It is not as debilitating as most and it's almost light enough to go about your day as normal .... not quite though. 

The flower smelled very citrus like which is to be expected considering the name. The taste of the flower when smoked is somewhat of a tropical and ...”"
sikwitit47,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1360052,"“This legit smells just like a pineapple field. Every time run across some though the buds tend to be on the smaller side but pack a decent punch.”"
Oceanundertow,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-fields/reviews/1756284,"“Unfortunately I have a 50/50 relationship with this strain as it's effect on me is a bit of a gamble. Most of the time it will yield a nice clear headed high with a very content and chipper feeling...but on other occasions I've had some pretty bad anxiety spikes and temple pressure that led to the dreaded 'sit down and ride it out' high.
The taste is fantastic though, especially when vaped, because it straight up tas...”"

Wow! Just covered in frost! It sure packs a punch! Love the uplifting effects without the paranoia that some sativas bring. The bag appeal got us but the terpene profile & effects will have us coming back for more. Thank You, Medicine Wheel!
