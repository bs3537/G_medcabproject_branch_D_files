I love how I can smoke it throughout the day and feel great, then it helps me wind down and sleep. Best head high ever. Talking, thinking and laughing.”"

I only need two hits of flower for desired effect. more hits makes me feel uplifted and depression diminished. although with most heavy sativas it can trigger my anxiety. so if you have bad anxiety. medicate slowly until you find a good dose for your tolerance”"
Mr_Zadir,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mob-boss/reviews/1391683,"“Picked up some Mob Boss from a local dispensary.  At first sight I noticed the green leafy buds with long red hairs.  The smell is earthy with a slight citrus note.  I smoked one small bud through a water pipe, the effects onset was pretty much immediate.  Achieved full effects after about 10 minutes.  Mob Boss is a great uplifting pain reliever. The effects are very uplifting as well as a slight tingle that can be f...”"

I found this strain from someone who recommended it as she has Lupus.  It is working very well for me.  Something that none of the pharmaceutical drugs we tried could do. I have to be careful as I have  PTSD and Panic Disorder but this did not trigger my anxiety or fear.”"

You can still focus and you're in a ridiculously good mood....  (my experience anyway.)  I would give this strain to friends who are new to cannabis.  Just a light, fun high.”"
stoneymacaroni,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mob-boss/reviews/1396625,"“Great strain! Effects are amazing for those looking for nicely balanced effects. The batch I got from the dispensary was testing at 27%, and had a pretty intense head high so new users should dose with caution. After the psychoactive boost (that does wonders for mood elevation) it just eases you down into relaxation thanks to the indica side. Versatile well rounded strain. Also I found that the indica side does great...”"

Yet while the intensity is quite strong it doesn't last that long for me. As for what I love about this strain, ironically (because I usually like indica's more), is the sativa-like effect.

This strain specifically gets me on another level, if I smoke a bowl by myself, I literally feel like I'm floating. Mob boss makes everything extremely funny yet very relaxing.

badtrip360,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mob-boss/reviews/1371274,"“Hybrids rule my world and Mob Boss does not disappoint!  MB is like playing Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald on a snowy night while eating a home cooked meal in front of the fire....ok, perhaps just for me but this strain is euphoric and super happy!  Great for cleaning the house or checking boxes on a long list of things to do.  MB is a great appetite stimulant and perfect for after a stressful day at work.”"
MrJane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mob-boss/reviews/1377245,"“Mob Boss is certainly a boss among sativa dominant hybrids. This strains buds were fluffy and had a light green color. Aromas consisted of a sweet diesel mixture that proves its lineage of Chemdawg. A strong citrus flavor makes this a favorite among sativa enthusiasts. The effects were mood enlightening and made the "circle" all laugh and enjoy each others presence! Recommended with great friends. Enjoy!”"
LordBaltimore,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mob-boss/reviews/1230878,"“The subject: Looks like it should, smells like diesel and vicks vaporub. Baseline: Bored, anxious, slight agitation & a slightly sluggish mind.                         First hit: (glass pipe) Tastes like it smells (see above), which I like. Leaves a clean menthol taste in the mouth. Agitation diminished almost immediately. Feelings of the slowing of time but not of mind.  New mind-scape. Reflective.  Feel like a junk...”"
ManRay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mob-boss/reviews/1460809,"“This strain does leave you feeling like a Mobb Boss. One of the most serious and analytical highs out their. I enjoy it for it's ability to create a high that is invigorating without paranoia or distraction, letting the user carry out their business. It can lack euphoria and relaxation however.”"
grownative,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mob-boss/reviews/1371295,"“Nice rush to the head once smoked. This strain is a potent one and amazing for instant pain relief. Helps with inflammatory symptoms, eye pressure, muscle tension, headaches, etc. Strong Cerebral Buzz, feeling creative with this flower and energized, good for daytime, but potent enough for a good nights sleep.”"
TheChron,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mob-boss/reviews/1398945,"“This is a powerful dank sativa.  If you've smoked a few different strains throughout the day and doubt you can get high again...it's time to have a sit down with the boss.  Strong clear headed high.  Ridiculously moist and sticky...you could hang posters with it.  Smoke this prior to doing strenuous activities...you feel genuinely stronger on this herb.”"

First, it begins with the unwinding step. The first puff made my nervous system literally decompress. Like an iron straightens a cloth, it erased any knotted feeling I could have in my body.

Upon lighting up my bowl of Mob boss I could right away taste the hint of the Tang Tang and the ChemDawg.
