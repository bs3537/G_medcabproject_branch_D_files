ezalb123,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1394229,"“Amazing strain. Tastes like breakfast cereal and looks like someone covered the buds with keif.”"
Tanuki,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1388505,"“Huge, fluffy flowers. White and fuzzy--almost like sage in color and texture. Pleasant fruity flavor with a quick finish. The quality of the high is just what I'm looking for to de-stress from work to turn around and ACTIVELY parent 2 kids for another 5 hours before I can sit down and relax. Calm, contemplative focus. Able to sit and be calm when there's nothing to do and ready to go at the drop of a hat.”"
crazycolton55,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1383178,"“This weed has a very fruity scent similar to fruity pebbles but more citrusy. The high is an amazing indica high that is just super nice.. very very powdery fluffy lighty dry weed, so because of its lack of density im giving it a 4/5 this weed creates the most munchy feeling of any weed I swear I ate a mixing bowl full of lucky charms while high on lucky charms amazing... :”"

Lord_Fox,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1380390,"“Very floral.
Really good, clean high.
Makes me a little loopy headed, but not in a bad way.
Doesn't make me tired.
Easy to focus on things......when you finally get up off the couch.
Doesn't do much in the way of pain relief, more of a head high.
Doesn't really induce hunger, I think I'm just ALWAYS hungry when I smoke it.
Taste lingers for about 15 minutes after you smoke, nice.”"
ALEX3100,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1413113,"“In my opinion one of my top 5 favorites , lucky charms slowly calms the mind and relaxes the body. I did not feel stuck on the couch, nice balance of mind and body... Appearance and taste are amazing!!! Lime green fluffy nugs with White frost trichomes/terpenes / no density. Taste is very sweet/fruity . I recommend trying this strain at some point in life.”"
JustinKCHC,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1386631,"“Beautiful strain. When smoking it tends to make me just sit back and jam some King Tubby dub reggae and enjoy every last bit of it. I'm not experienced or by any means a guru when it comes to Lucky Charms. But the last eighth I had was killer. I got some great shots of it too.”"

Malakoz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1639322,"“Lucky Charms stands for its name as a hybrid. I felt a warm relief in the back of my head that eased me into a cerebral buzz for the Sativa side of things. However, on the other side of the hybrid, it gave me an intense body relaxation, where it put me right into my chair. Some times I got one side of the hybrid more than the other.”"
D.Crocket,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1294858,"“I'm a writer, producer, graph writer, and freestyle guru. I love my

I was done writing a song faster than I've ever have.”"

Was able to get some things done but then the other side showed up. Heavy body euphoric sit down. Very chilled out as it rocks you in to sleepiness.”"
alongfellow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1554842,"“I found lucky charms to be a good choice to increase awareness comfortably. I think of it as a non-alcohol beer...there's a tiny bit of alcohol in there, that's how much lucky charms leans towards a sativa!”"

QGQUE,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1748132,"“I'm a combat Veteran OIF/OEF GunTruck. Lucky Charms is a high quality strain with strong medicinal and recreational benefits. The smell is sweet without being strong. The flavor is mildly sweet without being overbearing. The visual is semi line green, slightly sporadically chunky  with heavy resin, & trichomes. The mental effects are good for headaches, body pains small to semi heavy body pains, small to large amount...”"

It always puts me in a good,  happy mood without putting me to sleep. It's fairly helpful for arthritic pain as well.  A nice, balanced daytime strain for me. I don't get racy at all with this,  just happy,  relaxed and go with the flow yet clear-headed enough to get things done.”"

The buds were dense and very frosty, mostly dark green. The smell was very light and faint at first, but I only had a nug or so to work with so that may be why. Once ground the smell was citrusy with some exotic spice and herbal tones. The taste was unlike any strain I've had...”"

>Note to self: don't stop smoking Lucky Charms!!

wait.... hmm.... Which note do I listen to? 🤔 Screw you "don't write a review note", you're not the boss of me!!

okay-- so Lucky Charms is a bit on the potent side. if you're a novice smoker, I would start off small.

That said, make sure you don't miss ...”"

dizonofjuanathon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1233057,"“Lucky Charms exudes an inspiring and exhilarating high. With loud sweet citrus flavors and a totally mellow smoke, it's a perfect option for burning the midnight oil. Large dosing leads to a heady and relaxed feeling and of course sleep at long last. Depression , and creative stimulus would be my biggest recommendations for treatment with this strain. Or for someone who's looking for a nice evening any old time.”"

notjeffsessions,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1421663,"“I smoke maybe a bowl or two per week, Definitely a hybrid. I felt the uplifting feeling of a sativa combined with strange, tingly feeling I associate with indica. VERY powerful. Suggest a quiet, relaxed atmosphere to experience this one. But it's a lot of fun, if you know how to handle yourself.”"
JJH3885,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1178341,"“Beautiful flower very rare! Picked up this tasty treat today and I'm very satisfied. Smoked a bowl after work and felt refreshed. The high is great, it vibrates through out your body slowing your heart rate and relaxing your muscles but leaving your head clear and fully functional. Love it, grab it if you come across this flower.”"

Aperture,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucky-charms/reviews/1206860,"“Easy A- to A rating on this strain. Really doesn't get much better than this for chilling after work, or going out and walking the dog. Taste is like nothing I've had before, and a bit of nasal exhale  adds to the flavor. Nice and fresh batch thats still firm in the bowl after a few hits. I have nothing bad to say about this one! Reminds me a bit of Trainwreck with a little more chill out. Loving it!”"
