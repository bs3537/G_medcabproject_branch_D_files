I am a mom with sever back pain and depression and this Qrazy Train is hitting the spot for me, ten fold. I haven't felt this great in a long time, and I smoke pot all day! I feel creative, energetic but relaxed, happy,  planning, thinking and best of all pain free!  I am a bowl in and wondering how this ride will end.”"
cdubal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qrazy-train/reviews/1413403,"“Very strong lemon note with slight skunk. Blast off is immediate! Medical: helps with stress, anxiety, depression, IBS. Effects: will hammer you down. Very spacy ( you will venture out into deep space :) is very strong and novice users should start slowly with dosage. As usual with any strain it takes about 45 minutes to an hour for full effect. however this one has several waves of sneak attacks which makes it fun. ...”"
azmiked,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qrazy-train/reviews/1413404,"“Awesome aroma and not too bad going down with the bong, This one is a creeper, about 10 minutes after smoking it'll hit you solid. Moderate to heavy cerebral and mild to medium body high. All around an excellent smoke.”"
abetzer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qrazy-train/reviews/1384742,"“This is my second day and all is well. I just want to warn everyone, I thought this would be a great night time strain to help me sleep and it is the extra opposite for me! This has turned out to be a beautiful daytime strain for me, which I needed so badly!”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qrazy-train/reviews/1583400,"“I dabbed terpenes rich co2 extracted distillate, absolutely incredible. This strain has the fruity & some sort of spice flavor to it. I can't get enough of the taste, and the potency is out of this world.

This strain leads to heavy bouts of laughter & you'll giggle over the silliest things.
Perfect for dabbing before socializing, doesn't trigger my social anxiety.
.This is officially my hybrid strain from now on.”"

cubehead,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qrazy-train/reviews/1413407,"“The first thing that really made this bud stand out was the density. I bought a quarter, which; after some observation, looked more like an eighth. However I put a decent sized nug in my grinder and almost an unexpected amount of bud came out. The second thing you notice is the taste. Very very earthy, but it's a nice flavor. Being more of a straight sativa man myself, this hybrid was quite fulfilling and effective. ...”"

It is a special sort of high and it knocks out the hip pain and cramping I often deal with, while not knocking me unconscious in the process. I'm able to focus, but the mindspace is a bit more conceptual than functional, so I prefer it for pain relief during creative projects, light household chores (weeding is so much easier!),...”"

Joelwho,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qrazy-train/reviews/1212250,"“This is a very "low dose" strain. Just 1 or 2 good hits will have you focused and productive for hours. It has a good quick incline on the uptake that easily and seamlessly glides into cruise on relatively short order. this strange may have some Puna Butter roots (a rare Hawaiian strain from the late 70s-early 80s) in its lineage. Wipe up some crumbs and end up cleaning an entire kitchen. If you have something to do,...”"
Vanara,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qrazy-train/reviews/1229849,"“Got this at Eugene OG earlier this week at my budtender's suggestion. We each took two puffs and found that the name fits the form. It is craziness. Alert, happy, albeit without the ability to make sense of much. 
 When we want to get something accomplished this is not the ally. If we want to just chill...great.”"

Had some of this recently from a dispensary in Golden, CO and was very impressed with the buds.  The smell was too good.
Made me feel guilty for breaking up the nugs and toking bud that you just hate to see disappear.
This stuff is awesome with a very nice taste, smell and high!
I'll pick up more of this strain anyday!”"

pretty much my only strain,  except hard candy where lighting up would be inappropriate. 

vapor or bong. I prefer bong with this. vapor buzz is shorter, but very nice. bong buzz lasts several hours. pain relief for me is fantastic.”"

QT is tastes harsh and not very potent. It left me feeling sleepy and slightly annoyed, but not very stoney. Felt like I was smoking some bunk brick weed, so I kept having to look down and check it was the same shit I bought that looked so good prior. 
Avoid.”"
