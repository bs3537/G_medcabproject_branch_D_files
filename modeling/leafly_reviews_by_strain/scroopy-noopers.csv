I actually use this one during the day/later day since it can be a nice level of relaxing/pain relief/but without the overly tiredness. Just don't smoke to to much or it will turn slightly more sedative(i find that with any strain really tho)”"

And... that is one of my favorite strains. It smoked like a indica dominant cookie. I’m High-ly recommending this one. Great for pain n spasms n watching some major lazor 🥥🤙🏻”"
