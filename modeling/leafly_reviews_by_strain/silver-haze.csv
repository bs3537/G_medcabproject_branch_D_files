Like others have said, a little goes a long way with this stain. A couple pulls off a blunt or just a bomb rip and you're set. 

Highly recommend. Tastes fruity and sweet while having the calm earthy feel. Not a bad head high at all.”"

SO earthy in fact, that the aroma was identical to that of soil. Very powerful sativa head-high, I was more focused. I was prescribed Adderall for my ADHD a while back, and I'm just getting over being like super addicted to it. If only I had been prescribed this instead of that man-made shit!
