OG Poison
=============
tripdog,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1343412,"“I use this bud to alleviate insomnia, and to curb cravings for alcohol and opiates. All three goals are met with this flower. It is deep, dark green with some orange hairs and lightly crystalized. 



The aroma is nutty, with a strong presence of pine. I am not an aficionado when it comes to flavor, but I would say it tastes the way it smells but more mild. The smoke is on the harsh side, with some heavy expansion so...”"
Coloradolights33,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1326330,"“Smoked a small bowl of OGP to try it out, and was really impressed. After exhaling, I immediately felt the effects, and had to find a chair to sit down in. I watched tv for the entire time, too relaxed to get up and curb my munchies. Great bed-time strain, full effects are felt within the first 5 minutes. Not a creeper by any means. I will be smoking more of this next restless night. Only down-side is that while cras...”"
DiB,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1383225,"“Healthy dark green color with orange hairs all over and a nice frosty coating.  Nice density on the nug pods; not overly dense but a healthy heft to them. The smell is very unique on this strain. It's like a cross between fruit and grain but very strong. It tastes like it smells and could even be likened to beer flavors. The smoke is not heavy at all but it has a strong smell like the plant form. The high is smooth a...”"

devildogmafia,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1154743,"“The best strain for relaxation I have ever tried. It melts you like butter. A real revelation after 24 years of smoking. It also will put your ass to sleep if you hit the bong a few to many times, so watch out with this shit.”"
stoneybolaney,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1337929,"“Get ready to get struck to couch and nor do anything productive. Couldn't even finish in one dose and it definitely does the trick for pain. POTENT, tread lightly.”"
weediesforbreakfast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1145007,"“Not a complete knock out but still gets the job done for insomnia if you smoke enough. The effects took about 10 minutes. Definitely a higher grade strain.”"

demis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1165435,"“Im a OG fan big time , and this strain possibly is my favorite OG. The name tends to spook some ppl , but that's their loss. Really helps me sleep. If "deep sleep(pre 98' bubba x Larry og)" isn't around I stick to the poison for help with my insomnia”"
j3ll1fysh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1170025,"“Definitely an indica dominant hybrid here. I want to give It 4 stars but there was nothing special about that made me go "wow!!" Kinda just blunt filler weed imo.”"
xblackrobx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1302703,"“initial slow creeping head high, followed up by incredible rollercoaster trip down the rabbit hole of tingly body buzz, melting couchlock and ever expanding head cloud. no munchies involved but have plenty of water on hand...dry mouth like a desert.”"
ColdstoneSteveAustin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1234642,"“Awesome CBD strain!! Pleasantly healthy taste kinda like a V8 juice. Annihilated a growing anxiety attack in no time. Very calming with lots of clarity of mind.”"
xblackrobx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1321009,"“addendum to last night's review - leaves an extremely distinct (like no other green I've ever smelled) yet pleasant, earthy smell post smoke.”"
xblackrobx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1413544,"“initially a slow creeper? greens out of a fairly kiefy bowl had me a bit lethargic, then a euphoric head high..body buzz starts, kill the bowl, rollercoaster down immediately, tingly body buzz as head high expands. super trippy top shelf shit.”"
Chief-Wyattaye,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1340193,"“I’m a big fan of the CBD flowers, Poison especially! Great smoothness, evened me out perfectly in the mid-day when I needed some general relief without heaviness, I wish everyone would try this, beware the aroma however.”"
starrdoll4408,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1145006,"“smoked a bowl and effects started in ten to fifteen minutes. a mild head change, with decent body aches and pain relief. a good way to couch potato.”"
pauln483,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1267678,"“definitely helps with sleep”"
nicagreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1307540,"“I like Og Poison and if my tolerance was by so fucking high it'd be a one hit wonder :) 

Half way through my cone and I'm getting sleep, feeling relaxed, and all my negative thoughts and depression is stripped away. Euphoric wonder and peaceful somnolence. :) 

The bus itself tastes earthy and pungent and has a piney aroma as well.”"
Travis0420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1312175,"“Didn't know what I was smoking at first lit up and 20 minutes later I was thinking less about food and more about the nap I was gonna take. Love the pine and earthy taste, best sleep I've ever gotten without feeling even a little bit drowsy afterwards.”"
diazeldorado1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1286914,"“Found this to be quite similar to the ghost og very heavy and gasy smelling pheno”"
troyk003,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1271526,"“this strain is amazing 5/5”"
dankonlee21,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1461156,"“Extremely strong pungent indica strain. Comes in huge popcorn nugs in a bit of quantity. The effects out of a beaker with ash catcher are immediate and intensely sedating/relaxing. I can't sleep, this is a tremendous aid in sleeping and is better than medications I am on. This is not a social strain, not a wake and bake, and not a strain you want to use if you would like to do anything at all. And thats not just some...”"
zechgarcia11999,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1252385,"“awsome! Made me super relaxed & pain free.”"
FCWDLC,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1265590,"“They weren't kidding when they said it would knock you out. Half a blunt in, I couldn't hang and fell asleep. My friends and I could usually inhale an 8th in Idk an hr or so. We couldn't even do half an 8th without tapping out.”"
Mr.Rob,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1225050,"“Easily the tastiest and prettiest CBD rich strain I’ve ever had. The OG flavor, smell and taste really come through in this super lovely CBD rich strain. Smooth smoke, light head change and overall heavy body relaxation, but without the sleepy effect.”"
smokingnemo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1077543,"“True to its name, this stuff doesn't taste very good - but I got it because I was averaging 3 hours or less of sleep a night, and it definitely did its job. If you suffer from insomnia, grab this stuff. After you smoke this, it's basically physically impossible to keep your eyes open! It's cheap, and I imagine it would be beautiful in baked goods as a before-bed brownie.”"
StickyDank420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1321008,"“Very potent and very heavy hitting high as well as the buds are soo pungent and danky.. Nighttime use for those lightweights for the experienced ones you know this meds are great heavy highs”"
BasicBird,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-poison/reviews/1463761,"“I bet it is the best one for people that want to relax and do nothing, or watch a movie. So I made a mistake and rolled a joint with my boyfriend in the morning for wake and bake. I felt my head too heavy and instantly went back to bed. Also I had 2 bad trips from the first 2 joints I ever smoked from this strain. It leaves the worst taste of mud in your mouth. I guess this strain is not the best one for me but it se...”"
