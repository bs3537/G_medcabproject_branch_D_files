=============
redraspus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1413619,"“Okay, this is officially my new absolute favorite strain -- gives a nice, full body high, good feelings, and not too much head fog.  I'd get this one all the time if I could always find it.”"
TonyRedbones,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1384462,"“haven't tried this after hearing the hype and the hype was right! The high left me feeling in a good mood and active. tasted good in my bubbler but the joint I had was way too hard for some reason. just a nice enough high to put you on Cloud 9, but not weigh you down. I have sensitivities to paranoia and sensitivities to not being able to sleep mainly with Indica strains for some reason. Well, this train did not both...”"
kanna37,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1384463,"“This stuff is a knock out.  I've got such a high tolerance that almost nothing I've tried gives me that classic stone, but this one did.   I first felt it in my forehead, followed almost immediately by a heavy drowsiness that I'd forgotten a person could even feel with my severe insomnia.  And the anxiety relief as well as pain... This is seriously the most effective strain of cannabis besides Northern Lights that I'...”"
HippoCommander,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1374887,"“Ewok? This strain is so heavy they ought to call it Jabba instead! A powerful, knock-you-on-your-ass head high followed by deep relaxation and sweet slumber. I would like to comment on how long the effects last, but I'm always asleep with this one after about an hour.”"
UnicornIsland,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1384465,"“Effects are similar to the Golden Pineapple but they arent as intense. I would recommend this for people who feel the golden pineapple is too heavy in the head. Great strain for chillin with friends. Felt very happy, relaxed. Couch lock was minimal and temporary. Definitely one of my favorites. Smell and tastes of pine!”"
tampagreener74,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1384464,"“This is Strain was so frosty looking as if it were coated with a light sprinkle of powder sugar. Amazing scent and smiled smooth with a slight tickle that just makes you wanna giggle. I smoke an hour ago and I am still climbing. 2 tokes from a one hitter. Great stuff! Great place too,Dockside in SODO”"
bialerwest,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1384467,"“Favorite strain to date.  And I want to be very informative as to why it is my favorite strain.  I play several instruments and like to use MJ to enhance my playing experience.  So I want a strain that leaves you totally clear headed with enhanced sensation to totally hear the music and steer where the music goes, which Ewok does superbly.  With Ewok, I find myself very interested in the process of creation, and can ...”"

OldToby214,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1384466,"“The Ewok strain is nothing like the stupid marketing ploy from George Lucas. This strain is something truly special. I vaporized this in concentrate form with and eclipse essential vape. It was amazing the surging body high mixed the and energetic head high. I smoked this before parkour workouts and it was amazing. Like I became The Man Without Fear.”"

This has replaced Blue Dream as my go-to general strain; I've never found a more versatile hybrid. My first ounce of anything was Ewok; it's strong recreationally for just about any situation, and has ...”"

Which maybe I should anyway. At any rate this stuff digs right into your core. It won't be like Lando flying a YT-1300 into the main reactor of the Death Star. But it'll make you appreciate the rebel sacrifice as well as a good stack of pancakes.

What do those two things have in common? Absolutely nothing!...”"
redraspus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1384274,"“Yes, yes, and yes -- I keep enjoying this strain time and time again, the balance of the effects are perfect! Not too much brain fog, plenty of body high, and lots of positive feelings.”"

g.uniT420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1155104,"“This is one of the best strains I've come across. The smell and flavor are like nothing else. The smoke is really smooth and has a piney, nutty taste... Reminds of the woods where the Ewoks lived I guess lol. Fire Bros does a really good job with it, and all the other strains they grow as well.”"
yeags,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1298741,"“This stuff is great.  Got rid of the pain  but didn't put me in a funk.  Relieve pain and makes everything more vibrant.  A good way to describe it is like you got a pain shot from a doctor and took a very small hit of acid but without all the colors changing and stuff melting.  It makes things a lot more cheerfully.”"
wisestwise,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1142209,"“Took the spot as my favorite herb. Real berry-fruity taste, little hint of citrus in there as well. Fluffy buds make it easy to grind and roll. Really like Ewok and hope the market has it in for awhile.”"

Beebe420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1331117,"“The Ewok I tried was very 'Tangelo' tasting, if your familiar with that strain. Tangerine and piney notes. Nobody has better Meds than Have A Heart!! Love my CC family. This is a must try.”"

orgazmic420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1396200,"“This strain definitely has an earthy taste and hits you pretty quickly. It gives you a heavy head high and cotton mouth after a few minutes. Very relaxing but not couch locking. I could see laying down and falling asleep though.

Might have been the Latin Indie Spotify station, but thinking the Ewok was the main reason! Uplifting, energetic, creative... three of my favorite effects.”"

I smoked a doobie 2.5 hours before bedtime and I was still awake the next morning . I get a slight headache too. It burned not to bad , but I was a little disappointed with this strain.”"

geoooooo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1245774,"“Great cerebral head high hits instantly on the first toke, then followed by a nice relaxing feeling over the body.  No anxiety.  Clear headed happy high.  It will make you smile.  Tastes amazing and complex with Tangerine flavor.  Also great to vape.   Not sleepy, but if you smoke enough it will cure your insomnia.  Just a great all around good smoke for basically any activity.   Day or night, its a treat.”"

The budtender sold me Ewok. Now I am getting stuff done and having a good time doing it. Low odor, dense, very average smallish buds that give off amazingly hits and crazy good high! Get some if you find it. ✌”"
Ndub80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1389469,"“Bought flower from Rogue Raven, excited about the potential, but disappointed in the results. What it does have going for it is the way it smokes- it is INCREDIBLY smooth, but the effects are weak; smoked, smoked, and smoked some more, for a little head high that was good for about 1/2 hr. Maybe it was that particular harvest, who knows, but I'll spend my money on other products.”"
GnarlyBrownie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-walker/reviews/1481461,"“My concentrate hit super smooth. And the effects lasted a good hour or so. The first initial high wasn't too overt the top. A pretty level headed was depending on your tolerance but I'd say a good 3 hits should do the trick for anyone. 

Also the Star Wars factor gives it a must try for any fan of the series who partakes in a bit of that Endor Greenery 😎”"
