PamPoovey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jedi-kush/reviews/1417631,"“This is my go to medicine. I have huge problems with appetite problems, sleeping issues, stomach issues, and body pain. This strain knocks all of that out, even with high tolerance levels. Very strong strain, it's a Hybrid from DeathStar and SVF OG (both Indica's) great to smoke, eat a meal, and lay down for a great nights sleep. Also, is great for lost libido. It is HEAVY with smoke, this will make you cough, take s...”"
twizzleditter,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jedi-kush/reviews/1384424,"“A long time ago. In some soil far, far away. A lone grower started a plant whose parents possessed the power of the force. Imbuing their talents they created this strain. Tasting of citrus and diesel this plant if struck down (with a lighter) is more powerful then you could possibly imagine. Recommend this I would. High you will be.”"

Pandaprincess123,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jedi-kush/reviews/1384423,"“This strain is amazing!!
I have never had a strain treat my Bipolar Disorder so well in my entire life as a toker.
It has a rich citrus smell with just a hint of Diesel.

A Must Try for anyone with Bipolar Disorder/Depression/Anxiety”"
jakegirard,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jedi-kush/reviews/1417632,"“To this day still the best strain I have ever had the honor of toking. Its that kind of high that the more you smoke, you just keep getting higher, but it NEVER reaches that "I'm too high" point... its just the greatest care free euphoric feeling ever. Will purchase any opportunity! 11/10, highly reccomend!”"
travel,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jedi-kush/reviews/1344564,"“I kept getting these profound realizations! Those moments where you say to yourself "wow I never thought of it like that". I'm a seasoned smoker but haven't experienced anything like this quite so powerfully and with the ability to recall new insights. This is especially helpful in my job as a video editor/producer. It also helps decrease nerve pain.”"
ajuk2k,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jedi-kush/reviews/1359239,"“This strain tastes more amazing than blue milk. It also is great for some Jedi creativity and relaxation that lasts for a ridiculously long time. Although this part of the Force works more as an indica, it still got me creative. After smoking this, your midichlorian count will be even higher than the boat times. "May the Force be with you."”"
dborg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jedi-kush/reviews/1417903,"“This strain is truly one of a kind.  I have never had an indica with so many layers of high.  First you feel tingly with a solid  body stone, yet somehow mentally alert.  Then it turns into a pure cerebral buzz and your pain is gone.  Love this strain. Tastes great in a vape. Fabulous for anxiety and lack of appetite.”"
LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jedi-kush/reviews/1384425,"“I've been lucky enough to have this strain on multiple occasions and have to say hands down its some DANK Indica, lovely looking buds that have a strong pungent smell. Definitely a favorite! Highly recommended to all Indica fans!”"
Gelle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jedi-kush/reviews/1384426,"“Decent cerebral high that takes awhile to set-on. After a full bowl, day-dreams come into focus, and troubles melt away. Seems to make users really giggly - when my friends and I smoked it together we were all laughing like hyenas. This is NOT something you want to smoke before needing to focus or do something important, as I found it incredibly hard to focus on anything other than how awesome whatever I was watching...”"

If you need a deep sleep to recover and you don't have to do anything early the next day I recommend consuming Jedi Kush.

The taste is very dark and mysterious it's hard for me to explain
I recommend JK if your experiencing

Does not require as much water as my other strains. A nice heavy high body wise, with a strange jolt of creative energy. It's like it has a sativa chaser in the high. A better night time strain for people with anxiety or ADD. Good for watching a movie.”"
