Wabanaki
=============
Robochrist,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wabanaki/reviews/1737314,"“Rio Bravo under Edison Brand in Canada.

very uplifting and cerebral. it's also very good if you want to be fixated on something. you don't feel too much couch lock but more of a mental relaxation that relives all stress and allows you to really feel a bit of euphoria. I highly recommend Rio Bravo / Wabanaki”"

The strain is also very cost effective, for those trying to stay low tolerance(light weight), and make a little amount last awhile.”"

Hits you right in the face.”"
BarleyBuds,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wabanaki/reviews/1783894,"“Purchased as Edison Rio Bravo, I was extremely impressed with this strain. It was actually one of the more memorable strains I've had a chance to try. I had almost no body high, but the strain was very cerebral. Was vaping this on a walk down Banff Ave. I found that while I was walking as I got more lit, it was extremely easy to focus on the mundane, but it was also fascinating at the same time. Why am I staring at t...”"

Elmer_Budd,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wabanaki/reviews/1773628,"“And that's powerfulllllll stuff! I heard that the Wabanaki peoples are pretty offended to have a cannabis strain named after them, but honestly they should feel honored. I mean, it's not like they had some shitty ditch weed named after them... this, my friends, is kickass stuff. I've been high almost every day since 1994 so it's hard to find strains that can overpower me, but this one's definitely capable. The stuff ...”"

Didn't have a lot of pain but have been having a great time with this strain. Makes me super smiley and euphoric and quite relaxed. I get really anxious if I get too high and I'm still looking for a strain that doesn't do that for me (that's the only reason for the four stars), but otherwise it's great! Haven't felt as productive as I thought I would, but the mood lif...”"

BuzzVanzetti,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wabanaki/reviews/1802889,"“One of my favourites!  A really nice high, it comes on pretty quickly and gives some focus and energy to whatever you're doing.  Mine current batch weighs in at 17.6 THC but the effects would suggest higher. The hit is really surprisingly intense!”"
