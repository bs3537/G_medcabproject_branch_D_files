TheLittleGreenLog,https://www.leafly.com/indica/guido-kush/reviews/1356398,"“The smell is very distinct, almost how you know the taste of GSC. The taste is not harsh with not a real rich white smoke.  Great looking flower. Larger dense nugs with very lovely color consisting of dark greens, light greens, and brown hairs and trichomes!”"
