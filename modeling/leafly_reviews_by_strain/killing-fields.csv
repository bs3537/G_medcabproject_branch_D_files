Unfortunately, it also gives me a feeling of anxiety, but that may be more due to set and setting than the strain itself. Highly potent, highly recommended.”"

Budtender said it "was the closest to a pure sativa as he had ever seen", and I have to agree.  Uplifting, energizing cerebral high after just a few hits, with no signs of coming down any time soon.  If you've got shit to power through, this is the one to reach for.”"

Also because whatever it may lack in thc cbd wise the aroma and the complex berry, grape, lemony, slight hint of diesel flavor makes up for and surpasses any short comings. Can't wait to run her in my medical garden. Hoping for a solid purple pheno. From what I have had the green pheno has more of t...”"
