Fun to exercise on too, my bike ride back from smoking at the lake was glorious. Time felt both accelerated and slowed done. Feelings of being outside myself at times or in like a video game first person view with a high FOV so you see your arms.”"
paddyw,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/day-tripper/reviews/1411645,"“This gives a really clear headed high. Very mellow, no anxiety, but uplifting and cerebral. Doesn't lock you down like an indica at all, even though the parent strains would make you think so. Logical thinking is very lucid and clear, easy to converse. This bud isn't the strongest I've had, but it is very easy going and fun to do in the middle of the day, as the name would suggest.”"

It tested at 21. 18% THC and CBD 1.29%.  It smells citrussy and tastes a bit like metallic grapefruit, and it left a buttery taste in my mouth after the exhale.Nice!

I feel some sensation in the top back of my head and I feel the energizing effects of this sativa dom...”"

Good for day and will keep you focused”"

cresaywat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/day-tripper/reviews/1223073,"“This is one I keep coming back to. Smells so good, clean and sweet, and it hits smooth. Really relaxed high, happy and creative. I love it in the morning, but it's great any time!”"

ItsDefiNatalie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/day-tripper/reviews/1579898,"“It smelled almost cheesy to me- at first.  I definitely tasted the fruity flavor on the inhale, but the exhale is overwhelmingly gasoline.  Whew.

High is super mellow, tingly.  Definitely a milder stone.  Good for a beginner/lightweight smoker.”"
jonathanjoestar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/day-tripper/reviews/1697605,"“I am reviewing GaGa's flower version of this strain. Their is a slight focus head high yet my eyes are a little heavy and my body feels lose. At times I'd forget how stressed I was. To me the taste was moderate. If you are looking for a strain that is chill yet will not distract you from getting things done this is the strain for you. Very aptly named and will definitely be smoking it again.”"

0neet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/day-tripper/reviews/1222885,"“Got some of this stuff from the dispensary down the street -- it has an fine smell, a nice head high,and about 0.4g of the flower, vaped, gave me some light visuals and a steady buzz. The taste is a bit better than bland, and it's a 22% Sativa at market rate, making it something I'll definitely consider in the future.”"
MaxLoew78,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/day-tripper/reviews/1233387,"“Second go around with this Gem. Usually roll .35-.45g J and I'm good for a while. Super buttery scent caught me off guard.”"
fruity.pebbles.babe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/day-tripper/reviews/1638698,"“Very nice fruity, tropical, clean flavor. The high was very indica-dominant for me. I would give this strain 5 stars expect for the crazy bout of paranoia I got. Would try again though!”"
