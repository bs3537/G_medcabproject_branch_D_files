Skunk No. 1
=============
epochalypse,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1/reviews/1416070,"“A lot of people here seem to think that the strain is no longer the same as it used to be. They claim that the skunk no. 1 that they smoked in the 1990s was far superior to the skunk no. 1 that they recently tried. Sure, maybe that's the case.

But it has nothing to do with there being an "old" skunk no. 1 and a new skunk no. 1. While some unscrupulous seed banks and breeders may have tried to recreate the strain or ...”"

Strain is great, as for me more indica, maybe 80/20 :)
Kills from one-two hits from the bong;))
Definitely not the the 'morning type', because if you smoke it - the rest of your day will be somehow ruined - u'll be chilling in your sofa with a lot of candies, cat, and laptop:)”"
