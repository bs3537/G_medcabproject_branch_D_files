Butterscotch

anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butterscotch/reviews/1416105,"“When I opened the bag, I was surprised to actually smell a faint aroma of butterscotch. The buds are somewhat dense and covered in trichomes. The high is very relaxing and a great sleep-inducer. Classical indica mind-calmer as well, which is great for those who are prone to monkey-mindedness and need something to quiet it down. The body buzz isn't as strong as some other indicas, and exists mostly as a pleasant press...”"

What I can say is it does relax you in body but also keeps your mind quite focused and engaged, very social and MUNCHIES are strong with this one,  

It's not highly sedative but you do feel quite enough out of it not to drive or do any crazy physical or taxing tasks.

All in all I love it, great mid day to night strain.”"

ianDroid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butterscotch/reviews/1466580,"“Well I don't know if I'm just THC sensitive, but the smallest pinner I rolled to sample this pretty much incapacitated me.  I had little choice but to lay back and allow the high to do its thing.  As long as I was able to keep my train of thought away from concerning topics, the experience was fine. Intense.”"

After smoking it you could definitely taste the candy taste. This really helped out my buddy’s girlfriend. She has very bad anxiety and gets very paranoid when she smokes with us, but this curbed her anxiety almost instantly and she spent the night relaxed. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from anxiety.”"

Took one toke from my one hitter and I was soaring 10 minutes later.  Seriously... This is the strongest bud I have ever smoked.  Very strong euphoria without the pananoia and anxiety I used to get off strong weed. After an hour the indica effect kicked in and I was out like a light. I woke up with no grogginess whatsoever and f...”"
