As soon as you see this, especially by Elev8 get it asap, you will be so damn happy it won't even be funny. I've had it about 3 times so far always over 87% THC alone. This stuff smells and tastes so good it stomps on Girl Scout Cookies in my opinion, but that's my opinion. I found it best for Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, Pain & Spasms.

However my guy put the Gorilla Cookies in my hand and said screw the N.L. this time and try this. He said I won't regret it, and booooy was he right. The bugs are dense so the eighth I got looked a little short but it looked pretty. It weighed out fine, and I put it in my pipe. ...‚Äù"
MysticalToker222,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-cookies/reviews/1399220,"‚ÄúI bought this for my bipolar depression and it is amazing! It's really euphoric and I don't experience any anxiety at all; it's uplifting, no drowsiness, and makes me feel very happy; I do not get the munchies with this strain, which is usually rare for me; I feel energized and motivated to get stuff done.

I really love this strain and recommend it to patients suffering from bipolar disorder or depression!‚Äù"
Mikhronic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-cookies/reviews/1399219,"‚ÄúGorilla Cookies is one of the top 5 strains I've come across, it's loud AF and knocks you down for a long time. Besides paying more ($35 1/8) you will get your money's worth in THC.‚Äù"
UncleAcid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-cookies/reviews/1385506,"‚ÄúOh MAN! This strain shot right up to one of my Top Three GSC crosses of all time!! (And I've tried a LOT of 'em!) 

Super tight, extra dense nugs, very light color- interspersed with bright orange pistils. 

Smell- WOW! I've ALWAYS absolutely loved the unique scent of Gorilla Glue #4, but crossing it with Cookies is PURE NOSE HEAVEN BABY!!! So I'd say 5/5 for bag appeal, smell and appearance are top notch! üíØüíØüíØ

CamSiebenmark93,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-cookies/reviews/1410359,"‚ÄúThis shit mightve killed me 2x jk. But in all seriousness this strain was absolutely amazing.

ConceptProductions,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-cookies/reviews/1370606,"‚ÄúLooking (waiting) for this strain in Toronto, but I don't think I have much of a chance at the present time... 

I've yet to even HEAR someone mention it's parent strain, gorilla glue (any of the phenotypes) in my network. I'm sure that there are private cultivators, and maybe some of the small connoisseur grow circles, that have proper G.G. genetics somewhere in or around the city... but I've yet to come across it.

Blotterfall,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-cookies/reviews/1638841,"‚ÄúDefinitely an interesting strain, to say the least. The aroma is quite unique, almost minty but with the pungency characteristic of Gorilla Glue, and can be tasted during consumption. I'm not the biggest fan of Gorilla Glue's heavily sedating effects, but this strain is just the right blend of the parental lineages.

I'm currently sitting at my kitchen table wondering how I can make this review sound intelligent, but I'm simply too baked. Mega good head and body high.

EarthBae,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-cookies/reviews/1793305,"‚Äúvery very tasty ! seriously, it tastes & smells amazing. its piney & minty & just overall delicious & smooth. a perfect hybrid in my opinion. it gave me the munchies at times but also relieved me of a few headaches all while keeping me energized. it doesnt make you groggy or drowsy after it wears off which is something I look for in a strain. its certainly a keeper ladies & gentlemen‚Äù"

cvltceleste,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-cookies/reviews/1678636,"‚ÄúThe best of both worlds from Gorilla Glue and Thin Mint GSC, these very dense flowers will look smaller but will pack a bigger punch. My first time trying it was a blast, two fat hit later and I was on Cloud 9. I really recommend with people struggling with chronic pain or insomnia‚Äù"

CorpseCrow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-cookies/reviews/1764874,"‚ÄúPicked this up at a discount, which might have affected the quality. It's a decent high but it's made me feel anxious and paranoid, and it's a bit too intense for me. That said, my friends have no problem with it. Also some of the worst dryness I've ever had.‚Äù"
mojoriley12,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gorilla-cookies/reviews/1386788,"‚ÄúLove this strain!! It's a beautiful bud, smells amazing and it mellows you out. This is now one of my favorite strains! You can smoke it anytime of day, but it's more indica so if you wanna be super productive I wouldn't recommend. If you're looking to mop your floors or reorganize your bookshelves then I'd recommend it. Enjoy it guys!!‚Äù"

I've been looking on leafly for about 5 years now and have never thought to write a review until I tried this. DAMN. If you love indicia and love to just sit back relax and eat some food, this is the absolute best strain for you. Also, all pain will easily get relieved (had a bit of a headache before smoking it).

I know people love having euphoria and energy with little stone and no couch lock but it was too clear headed for me. I prefer a little Stoney effect from my hybrids.
