The OX

While it's not what I wanted, it is beautiful. The flowers are super dense with trichomes to spare. Unlike anything I've smelled. Just a hint of the typical cannabis smell, but a very strong sweet, citrus scent. The smoke was tasty and incredibly smooth from a clean bowl.

Not nearly as overpowering cerebrally as I was...”"
KylosDankDealer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/the-ox/reviews/1359027,"“This strain helped me immensely with my fibromyalgia pain for a few hours but didn't relax my anxiety or mood much. More of a pain blocker while feeling in control and not very high. Great to function on in daily situations like classes or work.”"
sodey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/the-ox/reviews/1375655,"“Absolutely love this strain. The purple color really pops and it tastes spicy and earthy. The best part are the effects...everything seems brighter and more beautiful. My entire body seems to melt but my head stays sharp. Do yourself a favor; smoke this strain, take a walk outside and enjoy life.”"
SlowNorman2008,https://www.leafly.com/indica/the-ox/reviews/1278281,"“This is a fantastic strain. You get the normal euphoric feeling of a deep indica, but it doesn't couch lock you. You stay clear headed enough to enjoy every moment of the high. The purple color of the buds is beautiful and the crystals 😍😍😍 I highly recommend this strain.”"

Fruity coffee flavors relaxed my muscles and mind . I would recommend this to anyone trying to relieve pain or pressure. Perfect example of what a good indica should be.”"

Schmeee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/the-ox/reviews/1364787,"“This is the first high CBD strain I've really messed with so take the following with a grain of salt. The concentrate has become my new morning routine and leaves me feeling great throughout the morning but without the head high. Nausea and head-ache problems literally gone before the vape left my mouth, but I can still function 110%. Nice chocolate taste with a bit of medicine-y background. A little bit of an acquir...”"
