Zeus OG
=============
tsurbrook,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zeus-og/reviews/1388352,"“In over 50 years of a love affair with Cannabis this is the second best I have ever smoked.  It starts out with a full explosion of bliss followed by a lovely berry/tropical fruit note.  It seems to last a long time in the pipe and is wonderful for pain.  If this strain is available and you can find an organic grower, go for it, you will not be disappointed.”"
vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zeus-og/reviews/1175282,"“UPDATE: the body buzz was strong, and much more pleasant this time. Great PAIN RELIEF. I packed the bowl a bit more this time, and began to feel euphoric about an hour in. High lasted 2 hours, the pain relief lasted even longer. Pretty sleepy at the end. In higher doses with closed eyes, music is kaleidoscopic. 

Mild smell and taste, the vapour had an slightly menthol coolness and stayed smooth until it was all gone...”"

emeraldvanessa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zeus-og/reviews/1339883,"“Good to smoke with friends everything is fun and hilarious. Yet, if you have a novice smoker the paranoia is real lol! Mainly a head high! Don't recommend it at night, it will leave you woke. But, over time this strain gets boring. It's a good strain to try though! Very strong smell :]”"
billzipz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zeus-og/reviews/1316211,"“Wow, this is a real great feeling high. Taste and smells superb and is a nice smooth smoke, very fluffy and light green, I think this just may be a new go to.”"

MonkeyBiz28,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zeus-og/reviews/1270466,"“Loving this wonderful daytime strain just tried some for the first time yesterday and was very pleased. Low THC but still gives that good cerebral high with good levels of energy.”"

dacrow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zeus-og/reviews/1263256,"“Had this during the day and ended going for a 3 hour walk, taking photos of flowers, and admiring the shops around my neighborhood.  High lasted for several hours on a small bowl.”"
Flipintripindicular,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zeus-og/reviews/1389025,"“Very clean high. After a euphoric energy it ends with a relaxing but not sleepy conclusion.”"
hermano_prod,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zeus-og/reviews/1665597,"“Solid upbeat strain without the buzz feel. your mind feels like racing ahead like a kid in the park but your body is like the parent, still and content to read.”"

Leeisms,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zeus-og/reviews/1737928,"“I have ADHD and social anxiety. This stuff works good to clear the brain fog which allows you to focus, and enjoy conversations. Good for stress too.
Tastes a little bit like pineapple on the exhale. Inhale tastes skunky to me. My buds were dense as hell. And had lots of crystals.

Vaped in my Grasshopper at 3.

I think this bud would be best used in social gatherings. I don’t think it would be good as a wake up, but...”"

TheHappyCanadian,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zeus-og/reviews/1362659,"“I agonized over whether I should deduct a star for the less than loveable taste (at least for me). While it vaporized nicely into thick plumes, I found the taste to be almost mossy, musky and very earthy.  

What followed was a slow onset but pretty intense psychedelic experience, mixed with euphoria and a burst of energy.  Still, no racing heartbeat, anxiety or paranoia. Visual and auditory distortion began to occur...”"
