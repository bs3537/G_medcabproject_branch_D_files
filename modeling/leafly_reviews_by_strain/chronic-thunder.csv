CaseyJ0nes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chronic-thunder/reviews/1415195,"‚ÄúI highly recommend this strain to any and all cannabis users who enjoy both THC and CBD and can handle being very stoned very quickly. One of my new favorites for sure, this bud has a pretty strong pungent diesel and herb smell to it, but with a very smooth and tasty smoke. I don't usually need a lot of bud to get me baked, but this strain surprised me with an intense and powerful high after only two hits (which did ...‚Äù"
azviejo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chronic-thunder/reviews/1385646,"‚ÄúI am a long time smoker of many types of marijuana and the Chronic Thunder I have been getting from Kind makes you feel like someone stole your bones. High THC in this one clears the mind and tucks you in for the night. Best to use in the evening. Definitely a top choice.‚Äù"
heavn420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chronic-thunder/reviews/1372216,"‚ÄúNew fave!!!! I have a fairly high tolerance so I'm constantly switching things up to find what works.

IandI,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chronic-thunder/reviews/1361465,"‚ÄúOne of the few strains that rates Insomnia first under Medical. Sleep is on its way. Hit it close to your bedtime hour, perhaps in bed with lights off and phone off, ready to crash. You will.‚Äù"
Genics,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chronic-thunder/reviews/1386330,"‚ÄúThis was one of my favorite strains. I have a bad back with constant pain. After a couple hits of Chronic Thunder I can feel all the tense muscles in my back relax. Best relief I have been able to find.‚Äù"
cemma,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chronic-thunder/reviews/1482196,"‚ÄúBest strain of 2015 IMO. One of the very strongest, at ~34% when first sampled. Despite the potency, it is a well-balanced strain. Taste/smell are neither unpleasant nor anything to write home about. 

After I sampled this strain I immediately bought the rest of the Benson dispensary's 2 ounce supply. This bud is better than it looks, and has a slightly pungent/chemical undertone. I will say that it is the best all-a...‚Äù"

guanope,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chronic-thunder/reviews/1335176,"‚ÄúThis is my favorite indica. I have had many, and nothing compares to the way this thing hits you. It's something you take when you want to feel
good before you're knocked out. Though the effects are powerful and give you a great high, my favorite part about this strain is that it doesn't taste like your typical indica. It's spicy, stinky, and stays on your tongue... definitely one of the most unique tastes out there....‚Äù"

I've tried many others for my conditions and nothing works quite as well for all of them. CT is a well rounded strain as it helps me with anxiety, depression, pain, and best of all - sleep!

I smoked it and it had a skunky, and sour-grape taste. It had a very couch-like effect and It put me in a deep meditation state.I really wanted to be myself; Seeing someone or talking to someone was making me parano√Ød and anxious.‚Äù"

So I'd like to try the new stuff. My only issue is the short legs of the high and it looked prettier than it smoked so for once a 4/5 for this strain.‚Äù"
