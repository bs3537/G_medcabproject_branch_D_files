Indicaem,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-og-kush/reviews/1415180,"“As an indica lover looking for strains that put me to sleep,  I had high hopes for this strain but was heavily disappointed.  This strain smelled wonderful, tasted great and was a beautiful smoking experience, but I did not feel relaxed or tired. Instead, I felt energetic, focused and productive. I smoked this right before bed and stayed up for 2 hours doing "work" on my computer.  I actually had to smoke some kosher...”"
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-og-kush/reviews/1410303,"“Very interesting looking very golden like and looks like the CBN shows on this strain it's only redish golden with heavy golden coat over some of the green leafs. This original OG Purple Kush is some of the best I have had. For such a low tested strain the vape is ultra thick very different. This strain makes me feel very very tired.

BirdBrain,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-og-kush/reviews/1372808,"“Purple OG tastes like a Christmas tree that has been rolled in grape fun-dip. The inhale is a menthol-like slightly-sour pine tree flavor split in half with the smooth and slightly floral aroma of grapes and mixed berries. The exhale expands a little bit, while more creamy notes of grapes and berries come to the forefront of the flavor. A creeper indica that settles into the body and head causing relaxation, mood lif...”"

HealthyMedJuana,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-og-kush/reviews/1391981,"“This is a GREAT FUCKIN STRAIN! One of the best purps I've had thus far! Very relaxing, the munchies kick in QUICK!!! So like it recommends, have your food / healthy snacks ready! I also recommend this strain for pregnant women suffering morning sickness or hyperkinesis (excessive vomiting). It will definitely take away the nausea and help you eat and keep it down.”"

Vaped a bowl out of my Volcano and sweet jesus I couldn't move but in a very good way! This is a must try as it has the OG traits but with a Purple tasting high. Definitely a very strong indica and a must try for people looking to relieve pain, trust me on this one!”"

brian318,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-og-kush/reviews/1341582,"“I think it is better than purple kush thanks to the OG kush parent. It starts off very mellow or an hour or so, then causes some serious couch lock... also serious munching. I'd recommend for night time use for sure and watching funny shows like American Dad. This strain is beautiful with its long orange hairs, heavy trichomes, and dark purple leaves throughout.”"
VicariousGreg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-og-kush/reviews/1341579,"“Excellent strain for insomnia.  Smells very sweet, and is a pleasant smoke.  Produces a nice, pleasant body high without being too foggy.”"
comixologist,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-og-kush/reviews/1136915,"“Strain analytics printed on the package said that the strain has about 13.5% THC and .47% CBD.  Fruity aroma, mildly floral, sweet. 

Dense, plush bud, pleasantly frosty and with some good pale-orange curly hairs.  The color is mostly a dark soft green, like lamb's ear.

Smooth-hitting, very mild piney flavor.  Quickly dulls muscle aches.”"

I didn't like the next day drag on my body, mentality, and strength. It seemed no matter how much water I drank, it did not qwell my thirst.
Would use again for sleep, but wouldn't use as much.”"
