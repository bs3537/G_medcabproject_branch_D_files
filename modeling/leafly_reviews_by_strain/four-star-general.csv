Great for shows!Almost eliminates the need for a grinder...intense head high! True to its description, very dreamy. Followed by a nice body buzz.   Overwhelming sense of calmness washes over you!”"
Calhxun,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/four-star-general/reviews/1389559,"“It's a good, long lasting head high. Even though it did give me pretty bad cotton mouth it is a really good strain. But it tastes great and is very loud.”"

I just loaded a bowl in my bong after work and I feel very relaxed.  I feel like it's going a movie marathon night.  Netflix suggestions?”"

I enjoyed some Four Star General before my 8 hour shift at McDonald's and i was very productive. Got many compliments from guests. Time flew by so fast. But this does cause very red eyes. Dont forget the drops for work!”"
