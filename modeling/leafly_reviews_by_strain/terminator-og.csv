It's a very strong indica, definitely a hard creep couch lock high. Great for pain, spasms and insomnia, a must try for any indica lovers. Stuff tested at 89.88% THC too!”"
TheConeMaster,https://www.leafly.com/indica/terminator-og/reviews/1363092,"“Terminator is a very strong, pure indica. Rare on the street. High quality. Great night smoke. If you are not a heavy smoker you must respect this strain.”"
Keishap04,https://www.leafly.com/indica/terminator-og/reviews/1457437,"“Favorite so far. I was super productive with zero anxiety. Also allowed me to have singular thoughts instead being scattered. Love, love, love this one!”"

HerbeHeureuse,https://www.leafly.com/indica/terminator-og/reviews/1317407,"“I got some Terminator on a $6/gram special and I scored!  Mine tested at 25.82% THC and .08% CBD.  Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger this strain is strong!  I'm feeling the effects after only a few hits and I have a high tolerance / blaze every day, so... :)

The only reason I don't give Terminator 5 stars is that the flavor in the particular batch I got is mild, and perhaps that's why it was on special for $6/gram.

This was 2 years ago, and I remember it being the best flower I had ever smoked before trying distillate cartridges. Had me not being able to move out of my bed, and I slept well that week.”"
yawza,https://www.leafly.com/indica/terminator-og/reviews/1411812,"“I fuckin love this strain already, especially after a week and a half long tolerance break... I only took a few hits froma grav bong and felt the effects within 3 minutes...I felt that out of body sensation, and was super creative and happy 20 more minutes in. Then it slowly ends with a great couchlock body buzz.”"
1stoner2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/terminator-og/reviews/1352753,"“Terminator is one of my favorites. This batch is a heavy hitter with a loud skunk OG smell and flavor...really good, after a few puffs had to put it down and I smoke daily.”"
Irievibes420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/terminator-og/reviews/1443457,"“They don't call it Terminator for no reason! This strain is a VERY hard hitting powerful indica. I smoked it in a bong and immediately felt the effects upon exhaling this sweet sensi smoke. At first came feelings of happiness/content  followed by a deep physical relaxation. This is a great strain to end off a long day with.”"
