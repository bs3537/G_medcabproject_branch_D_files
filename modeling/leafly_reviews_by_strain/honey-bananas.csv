Honey Bananas
=============
VickiJ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-bananas/reviews/1398433,"“This is definitely one of the best strains I have ever tried besides Blue Dream. It uplifts you into the happiest, calming mood ever. It also can get you very aroused because all of your senses are intensified. I had multiple "O's" while high on this. It seemed like it lasted for ever. Even music feels like it's pulsating through your body. Very euphoric too... I would recommend this strain for anxiety & depression, ...”"

Very sweet taste that tastes like delicious bananas with that sneaky scent of honey.  After the psychoactive effects hit me within minutes I relaxed on my sofa and dozed off into an extremely relaxing hibernation for hours!!! All my pain was withdrawn from my body and I felt nothing but  perfect rest. Then when I woke...”"
FeggansA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-bananas/reviews/1363475,"“Just absolute fun. What a wonderful strain. Smells amazing and unique, since banana is such a rare smell for pot. Smoke tasted even better than it smelled.

But the real treasure here is the effects. Floaty, giggly, happy as hell, incredibly relaxed, and surprisingly clear-minded. Don't get me wrong, if you want to be brainless on it, you can be, but if you do need to form thoughts and sentences, you can. Get togethe...”"

surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-bananas/reviews/1356156,"“so I squeeze this gorgeous bud and tilt it to my nose detecting dreamy waves of island living. Banana's wafting in a tropical breeze. The inhale pulls smoothly, coating my tongue and throat with honey sweet joy. I exhale euphoric clouds of hazy sweet satisfaction. Now It seems I have a new friend.”"
Radiogrey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-bananas/reviews/1356155,"“With this dense dank bud just coming across our boarders here in portland we know quality when we see, smell, and taste it. Burns slow and taste that haunted me all day. We are getting it tested stay tuned.”"
MrFigueroa91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-bananas/reviews/1532942,"“Honey Bananas is an exceptional Hybrid that hits like a sativa yet soothes like an indica.

As a take in this beautiful 45° weather I began to drift to euphoric bliss and absolute happiness. Wonder flower this is, and as ...”"
LetohatcheeApache,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-bananas/reviews/1619882,"“Picked this strain up from Essence and I must say this is DEFINITELY a hidden gem! The cultivators (Greenway Medical) did an exceptional job. When I popped the bottle, I was hit with a sweet, honey smooth smell. Once broken down by my fingers, inside was an oasis of trichomes and was hit with a earthy smell to remind me this wasn’t an edible.
I chose to stuff this in a Sweet Aromatic Backwood. Once lit, a sweet punge...”"
SpeshulEd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-bananas/reviews/1303936,"“I was able to find this in shatter at my local dispensary. It kicks off with an instant body buzz (everything is tingly) and head rush - almost feels like you stood up too quickly. It has a nice sweet taste, definitely a hint of banana.

Being indica dominate, I did this in the evening while watching tv. I was fairly engaged with what I was watching yet at the same time was just kind of enjoying the ride. My shoulder...”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-bananas/reviews/1641102,"“Comes on very easy and peacefully. Perfect for beginners. Euphorically relaxing like a good massage and just as physically soothing. As high gradually builds you can feel your brain growing distant. Senses take a hallucinatory bent and combined with the brain letting go, you can’t help but be consumed by your senses. Despite how overwhelming of a change it is, the high has the most stable, tranquil and peaceful menta...”"

clk9565,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-bananas/reviews/1382849,"“I am currently vaping a CO2 oil of Honey Bananas and it tastes amazing, almost like a banana flavored candy. The high is a little slow to start (even at 80.7% potential THC), but it's excellent. Tension melted from my muscles as a smile crept across my face. Definitely the kind of smoke that's great for doing yoga or an easy walk, but there is a little couchlock to contend with.

jimmyinspazzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-bananas/reviews/1503299,"“Honey Bananas is a mixed bag of emotions for me.  Being a very complex strain that produces a stifled, anxious response within me at time.   About a half hour into certain middle ground hybrids my body checks out exhausted while my head races.  This intense claustrophobic head trip was barely apparent with this strain, but enough to make me mention.

Jay_Indica,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-bananas/reviews/1621511,"“First Impression: Smooth, Obvious banana flavor, 

Final Impression: Very nice and smooth strain. This is not for getting a euphoric head trip. It’s more for when you need to just relax with something smooth and flavorful while still being clear minded. Good for moderate users. Help soothes pain and clears the mind.
