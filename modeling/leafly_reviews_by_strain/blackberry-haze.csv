No fatigue or lethargy from this strain, which is very important for me. I suggest if your looking for a good day time med give this one a shot!”"
PunkReggaeFan4Life,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-haze/reviews/1225243,"“I found this strain to be exactly what I prefer in a sativa. It uplifted my spirit, gave me a very good mental high without impairing me and was also very easy on the lungs. I found it easier to smoke the blackberry haze by rolling (with joints as I do not smoke blunts often) rather than packing a bowl as it burns out rather fast. It was actually the right speed I prefer so that if you pass it around without letting ...”"

Longbottom_Leafly,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-haze/reviews/1458272,"“I have vaporized and smoked this strain. The smoke is very harsh. For me, the high is unremarkable. It also has a pretty bad "burnt" or "hangover" feeling afterwards. I would only smoke it if it were the last strain that I had available. I also would not smoke this right before bed. I could not fall asleep for several hours (multiple nights).”"

IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-haze/reviews/1333676,"“Potent sativa. Fluffy purple speckled buds with and a great berry tasting and smelling haze. A little stonier than some other sativa's so not the best go to for being productive, but a great social and overall uplifting strain. 4.5/5”"

After smoking this you will instantly see how this strain is a complete sativa dominant strain.”"
voice918,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-haze/reviews/1358628,"“Great flavors of vanilla, blackberry and sugar. Very calming, and clear. 

My first purple sativa!

I think the keyword for this strain is balance. 
It's strong enough in sativa, that I can dedicate myself to creative work, but has just enough indica to create a mood of meditation and reflection. 

I only give it 4/5 because I still prefer a purer sativa to help me battle my lifelong laziness. 

But the high is great...”"
