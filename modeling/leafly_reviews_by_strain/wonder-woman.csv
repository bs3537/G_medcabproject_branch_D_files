elevated_scientist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wonder-woman/reviews/1350287,"“Fresh Baked kills it with this strain. It delivers a slap-in-the-face peach flavor profile that will have you salivating. By far one of the fruitiest strains I have ever smoked. The high is uplifting and true of sativa genetics. I always try and have some of this on hand.”"

4Rare420Rx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wonder-woman/reviews/1354204,"“Well put together hybrid genetics, so so in most places I have seen it. Huxton and Monarch are not one of them, theirs fit the category of "damn that was done right" and thats all we're looking for at IRIS, sight, smell and high all in one (a rarity in the #azmmj market. Kudos to Monarch and the obviously strong grow crew at Huxton. Pharmagrade,👍💯💯💯”"
ElevatedLatina,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wonder-woman/reviews/1372275,"“Severely disappointed. Bought this strain in Tucson and it was one of the Huxton series "Zen" with a potency of 8. There was no smell or flavor palette what-so-ever. It's been a long time since I've smoked weed with no flavor and I hope to go the rest of life without this kind of sad experience! I wouldn't believe anything that Huxton claims since one of the things they claim is that they hand trim... ummm well let's...”"
