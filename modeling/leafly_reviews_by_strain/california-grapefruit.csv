LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/california-grapefruit/reviews/1353399,"“Amazing Indica, very relaxing, hard couch lock when more is toked. Smells great, tastes crazy, and gets me stoned hard that pretty much sums up this Indica, I'd definitely get it again any day. I seem to find it best for Insomnia, Spasms & Pain. Can't get over the smell and taste, truly just like Grapefruit!”"
Knappstir,https://www.leafly.com/indica/california-grapefruit/reviews/1413252,"“I purchased a gram and smoked about half when I got home. It was the worst experience of my life. It felt as though I was 5 years old and couldn't do anything accompanied by horrible hallucinations. The people I talked to at the dispensary seemed unsure of the product and didn't talk much but they had a fair selection that was close by. I will NEVER buy from them again.”"
