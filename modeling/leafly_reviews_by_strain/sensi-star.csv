Sensi Star

Fargo123,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sensi-star/reviews/1416501,"“Sensi Star is the most powerful anti-anxiety cannabis I've ever smoked. I suffer from a rare condition that causes me to feel stress at extreme levels that are unbearable (The type of anxiety that is so bad you'd ask for assisted suicide). Smoking Sensi-Star puts me in a state where my anxiety is literally at 0.00/10 for 2 to 3 days after smoking a small sized joint of it. My anxiety can be at 10/10 for weeks in a ro...”"

It totally made me dizzy and anxious due to its hard hitting feeling straight in the head and chest, it hits your lungs hard and boom.

ozjthomas,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sensi-star/reviews/1414973,"“Sensi Star is about to make me a convert to indicas its that good. It has a very pleasant piney taste, a slow to start but incredibly strong pain relieving, euphoric, aphrodisiac stone that for me was accompanied by a happy trippy mental fog. It doesn't hit me too hard like some indicas that put me right to sleep- it still is great for sleep but doesn't just knock you on your ass and walk away.”"

CamGirlKitten,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sensi-star/reviews/1417431,"“The SensiStar I picked up from Collective Awakenings was a fun and unique high that had great pain relief, but it had a shorter, less intense high than I was expecting. It was a really mellow high with talkative tendencies, while still being productive enough to get things done if you need to (however motivation to do so can be difficult). Definitely had that classic overly citrus flavor.”"
fartysmoker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sensi-star/reviews/1414976,"“at first this strain made me feel really happy and optimistic. I started thinking to myself that I was going to start doing yoga everyday and work out a lot.  I also thought that I might try spray tanning. After about 10 minutes I realized I didn't have the energy to do any yoga or the motivation to work out but I do think I could end up just doing the spray tanning. it's better than nothing and I still feel happy.”"

But what I really like about this strain is the hot cold sensation it brings from head to toe. Almost like a euphoric space maneuver feeling as if you're in space, or space-jumping the moon.

I've found that the indicas tend to interfere with motor skills a bit and this can cause an anxiety reaction including raising heartbeat.  Sativas have much less of this effect.  You might want to explore an outdoor grown sativa and see if you do better with it.”"
