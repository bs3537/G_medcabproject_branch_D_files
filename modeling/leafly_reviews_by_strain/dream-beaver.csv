Katsuth,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1390466,"“So far this is the best I can find for my anxiety and depression. It levels me out, make me feel normal again, stops my brain from thinking of 50,000 things at once and let's me focus on one thing at a time. Sadly it's rare so I can't find it often, one day it will be at 5 different dispensaries and the next it's no where to be found, gotta jump on it and stock up. I wish there was a way to be notified when it's stoc...”"

Two or three hits in and your head is tingly, you feel like you can discuss astronomy, and you are genuinely happy. This strain sets a new bar. My strain was grown from Jet City Gardens and I'm too scared to try any other gardens' Dream Beaver. It's that good.”"

Dream Weaver supplies an amplitude of energy and places my mind in a compatable state for letting my creativity flow. Mild cerebral buzz, not sedative. Long lasting effects too. Cured tummy aching.”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1460533,"“The name threw me off at first. This is one complex herb that any experienced smoker will enjoy. Creative, uplifting, happy, energetic and slightly relaxed. I feel it in my shoulders and forehead. I anticipated anxiety but never felt it. Dry mouth was pretty bad. Smoke tastes sharp like wood, pine needles, skunk, with hints of lemon and pepper. Small lung expansion immediately with decent short cough. Emerald green p...”"

chasenbud,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1346148,"“I have only been able to try Dream Beaver once. Grown by Phat Panda in WA I hope soon they can get some more out to pierce county. I don't remember much about it as it has been at least 6 months ago. It has a very piney smell and gives a great sativa high.”"
Strainge,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1287789,"“Done in the form of a Phat Panda concentrate.  Super tasty, giggly euphoric effects that came on strong and lasted a while.  Some dry mouth and dry eyes, but no anxiety or paranoia.”"

tony831,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1567002,"“Love this strain. Picked some up on a recommendation from my budtender. Great taste, amazing smell, with a hella bomb ass high. The high is predominantly in the head, but gradually seeps down and relaxes your body. Great for gaming and interacting in a social setting.  Paid $31.50 for 1/8 locally.”"

theyofthedream,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1397850,"“This is a great one I can use for medicine or just when I need a little motivation. I started using it to calm down my physical ticks and seizures, which it did, so now I use it on a near daily for those benefits to it also helps me clean my house.”"

devildogmafia,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1229487,"“A very heady high for sure. Great piney taste with a very mellow smooth after taste. I agree with other reviews that it is good for wake n bake. In the same league as Super Silver Haze. Got mine at Issaquah Cannabis Company and Phat Panda deserves a shout out. It is as chronic as some of the good medical marijuana in the area which is saying a lot. We grow fire smoke in them Cascade Mountains.”"

JadedTakesThisSerious,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1303764,"“Helps a little with some pain.  I found it to be heady an give me heavy eyes,  with a pressure sensation around the front of my head.   For me this is a normal daytime med, not an upper but not gonna make me sleepy either.”"
HoseDragger,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1659359,"“When I take just a few hits I get a definite head high, but it doesn't have any noticeable effect on the rest of my body, leaving me wanting the buzz all over.  Then last night I decided to get really high before bed and used my dry herb vape for like 10 minutes strait.  I got stupid high all over and that was wonderful!  but then I put on my headphones as I stumbled into bed and turned up some of my fav music,for me...”"

It's everything you would expect from a sativa👌 Gives off a a great energy boost, and makes you feel awake. The euphoria it creates is a nice wave of happiness that floods your whole body. Very good choice for wake n bake or when you need your spirits lifted😊”"
patmgallagher,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1346151,"“way stronger than i was expecting. the dose i had was a 1g joint at 21.9% thc but it was one of the stronger smokes i have had in a while. a really good classic sativa high. smell and taste arent amazing, but definitely not bad. would likely buy this again. perfect day off daytime smoke.”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1472056,"“Best thing about this is the smell... almost exactly like cedar, with a bit of skunk thrown in for good measure. It's distinctive and wonderful.

This was stronger than I expected. It reminds me a lot of sticky haze or liberty haze... it's so heady that even if you do have energy, you're not necessarily going to do all that much because you're so high.

I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again, but if it's on the ...”"

wolvesofchernobyl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1701624,"“This one is a great time. Very upbeat and optimistic vibes. I was totally stoked to be pacing around my apartment haha. It was even better when watching a good comedy. Great outdoors as well. Everything becomes HD and vivid. It did give me a strong case of the munchies though. But damn it enhances all the flavors haha. Overall, I really like this one! Memorable. Would definitely recommend!”"
NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1219674,"“Great amazing strain lots of energy but not overwhelming. The taste is of black tea and wood not like pine wood more like oak or something. It's almost white it's light green is so covered in a dense covering of crystals. It's deffinetly a daytime strain but it's one I could smoke all day.”"
mamamarijuana1118,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dream-beaver/reviews/1716922,"“So this is a new one I tried just recently a joint by phat panda. I purchased it at Freedom Market in Ilwaco Washington for $8.00. 

I have actually been on a sativa kick lately and it has been glorious. I highly recommend for a mood lifter. It's not too bad for night time I did however get the munchies and i shared it with my boyfriend and half of the joint messed us up pretty fiercely and we are both avid smokers.”"
