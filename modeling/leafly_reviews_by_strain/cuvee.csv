BudMasterson420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1381632,"“Smells wonderful & flavor is top notch when vaped! This strain takes away your pain with a a literal body "buzz". Feels more like a calming social hybrid than an indica. Not a lot of couch lock. Relaxing yet stimulating, great for relaxing social situations & the creative process! Out of this world taste!!”"
forest44,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1430372,"“Got this in cured resin form.  A few hits of this and feeling a relaxed and euphoric body high.  Good strain for winding down.”"
BaronOfBud,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1374430,"“Nug Run processed by OilRefineryCo from TLC in Los Angeles.  Serious Terps and a one of a kind flavor unlike anything else. Glad i got some before it's gone!”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1540216,"“Not too bad. A decent indica. I have the cured resin shatter & I love the taste almost like cherries & chocolate. 
Although this strains an indica it didn't make me feel tired at all, in fact it made me feel like going for a long walk.
Slight heightened senses mostly visual everything looks beautiful and crystal clear.
Give this strain a try.”"
Judotapout,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1416514,"“Lov it. I got a cuvee joint from disp today. Can u say mellowwwwww...lol. i dont know why everyone says its low thc. The joint i got was 29.4 percent total.”"
yoyo88,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1428378,"“This definitely has an awesome body high. Hits hard even though the percentage is low! Very tasty. However it did make me a little anxious. Overall it's a good strain. Gotta try it once!”"
BudMasterson420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1301680,"“Excellent flavor, possibly the best taste I have ever vaped. When I use this strain I often feel like my body is buzzing, seems to work well for pain... Overall excellent!!! Taste is awesome &buzz is relaxing yet  stimulating. Great for conversation and social interaction among friends!!”"
sRinfo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1331596,"“Really light and refreshing! Great for still interacting with other people while enjoying the effects”"
lvrgm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1303919,"“Great high but don't expect a typical Indica. Like many other reviewers, Cuvee treated me like a great Hybrid.  I felt happy, relaxed, my body seemed to humm, and I did not have couch lock nor was I sleepy. Great for socializing or kicking back with a book.”"
Davifit,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1522620,"“Wonderful flavor when is vaped! After a few hits you can feel a softly high climbing to your head. Mind relaxed high but still let you to focus to do things.”"
taylor613,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1371492,"“Despite the relatively low THC content, this strain is amazing!  It's great if you're looking for something to help you get active and motivated.  This is my go-to when I need to spend a day cleaning the house or yard, and it tends to be a bargain compared to other strains.”"
LEB916,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1258003,"“Amazing and outstanding - the perfect strain for the creative process.”"
nativemikeyb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1473305,"“The buds are rich in this dark orangish and dark green color that really makes it stand out. The strain hits you hard with euphoria and you’re relaxed and care free while feeling mildly sleepy. One of my top 10.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1540220,"“Great indica, doesn't make me sleepy though. I do feel relaxation from head to toe within minutes of medicating.
Also makes things look better, visually stimulating.
Would be the perfect strain for a rainy day and video games.”"
buttahbenzo5280,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1417501,"“I like this one. Really good body high. Nice to just smoke and chill, but also gives a little energy kick so you're not a zombie. I struggle with anxiety heavily and I've had this one create some nervous energy but not much which I was surprised seeing as the negative to this strain is anxiety. Oh and doesn't kill your wallet!”"
GnomeGuy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1417539,"“This is a surprise, at a lower THC level it still hits like the big boys. I used a vape for this one, and it was a nice clean.”"
RockSteady365,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1320334,"“Lovvvee it”"
funkvsfunk,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1391281,"“It's a great strain with great flavor and a beautiful bud. I really like I for a nice, light mellow. Sadly it is a low THC plant, so if you have a tolerance this bud will likely not do it for you. Would recommend for a first time or casual smoker.”"
GrapesonGrapesonGrapes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1567259,"“Received a sample of this strain from a client of mine that’s grows for a collective here in the Portland area. At first glance the flower looked very nice and frosty. They were a bit fluffier than I expect d it to be. A minty blue green with light yellow calyxes. The smell was pretty pungent and skunky, with a light fuely scent. The taste was piney, earthy, and sharply hazy. The effects were a bit lacking in my opin...”"
daydreamerinwords,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1616383,"“This is an indica for people who like sativas. Surprisingly uplifting for an indica, with intense cerebral effects being felt within 10 minutes. I'm a person that uses indica strains for anxiety and depression, however this particular strain makes me feel a little racy and definitely more absent minded. This strain is good for enhancing the senses, but that awareness can turn into paranoia quickly if the time and set...”"
Finn2017,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1666013,"“New smoker and the first time I’ve tried this strain. Vaped it among friends and the flavour was woody and earthy. Very smooth vapour without coughing and my pain quickly drifted away with an extremely relaxing and mellow buzz. I found it to be quite social and tingly, I had a mild perma-grin regardless of the subject of conversation.   I really enjoyed this strain and it’s effects allowed me to be social without cou...”"

Not_aphrodite,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1751934,"“I really like this strain! I was nervous after seeing the Anxious bar so full, but I decided to take a chance on it. Over all I really enjoy it! I smoked on before settling in and playing video games for the night. It is a nice flower to share with friends and it has a good flavor. The only downside I did experience was Anxiety, but only one time and it was after I tried to push through and finish a bowl pack which w...”"
sscacco420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1804954,"“What was I thinking? Oh yeah I remember. Oh wow, I forgot again.
Oh yeah! Cuvee is the best high I have had in a long time. Inhale and exhale are mysterious, all kinds of flavours. I think I found the one. Cuvee baby don’t ever leave me. I found the strain. We have Chemistry. If you r in Washington, go to Kush21 in Seattle.

MarijuanaWriter,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1250235,"“Smooth smoking bud that offers an uplifting and creative vibe! A nice earthy taste compliments the floral aroma of this strain. Highly recommend for those looking to elevated their creative process!”"
Pintadopdx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1390323,"“Cuvée is like SE Portland in June.  Voodoo Dohnuts smell wafting over the construction sites that transform the summer skyline.  Light little flowers, soft fluffy smell.  Best paired with SE Portland in June.”"
ldbaker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1258893,"“Couch Lock Hug from a warm relaxing friend we call mary jane, cuvee to be exact. This one is a no brainer and a taste that is out of this world ! Grab a g of this concentrate or flower, that wouldnt be a bad choice either. Perfect night time indica that doesnt put you in the bed instantly . A++”"
Vdawg4200,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1657743,"“Good high. My 1/2oz was on special so that’s why I tried it. The high was ok, but the SEEDS were bad news.”"

Fullyman1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1380903,"“Just like it says this strain blasts u off and let's u down easy. This is a hybrid to me not indica though,no couch lock just good vibes. Dank smell with purple undertones like chocolate or something. mid day smoke as it tends to blast u out there but highly functional. good social strain.”"

ghostedandlost,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1605496,"“One of my favorites. I mostly smoked Cuvee during the last year - 2017, when ever the club held it, I bought it :)

The flavour of a Cuvee is how I use to describe a well flavoured indica. Smooth and a bit nutty taste.

The high is there in the beginning, but mostly you will be stoned on Cuvee. Drift away in thoughts about life or get trapped in some work you wanna finish. Creativity booster, probably great for any f...”"
jeroling,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cuvee/reviews/1417502,"“My hubby has been using cannabis oil to treat his cancer. He has never had an panic attack in his 62 years of life, even when he was doing 1.5gm/day.  Within a week of starting 0.1gm/day of Cuvee, he had 2 panic attacks.  You are correct that anxiety is a strong negative.  He will not use it again, nor would we recommend it to anyone.”"
