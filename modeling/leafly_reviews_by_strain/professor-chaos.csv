At first it made me feel very mellow and relaxed, almost sleepy. After about 15 minutes, once the full effects had kicked in, I was very energetic and focused, and my migraine was gone! A word of caution: don't take this before bed. I did I couldn't sleep, I was up all night, and finally got up at 6 am. Take this as i...”"
