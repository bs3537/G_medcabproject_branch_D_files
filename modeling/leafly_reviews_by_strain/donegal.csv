Donegal

jjalexander,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1172696,"“New to medicinal cannabis, I've been trying to find a strain to help me titrate down from the large amount of meds that I have to take in order to fall asleep each night.

Last night I started my evening with vaping strains (CBD) that would help me mellow out. I ended my evening with vaping Tweed's Donegal. It was recommended to me by a Tweed Customer Care Rep because of its long lasting effects. 

Donegal is smelly!...”"
SDitko,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1735470,"“Picked this up on 1017, as it was the only Sativa they had in stock, but was surprised with the great energetic vibe that doesn't overwhelm. Awesome fruity after taste from vaping. Would recommend.”"

oilersfan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1748086,"“This strain is great. Got so much done. Also it did not give me dry mouth.”"

Dayzt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1749772,"“Very energetic, but relaxing at the same time.”"
BowenIsland,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1738124,"“Donegal has very small light green buds that look like they could come from the shores of Ireland.  This is definitely a Sativa leaning hybrid and would I only use in the daytime.  I got a good hit of an uplifting euphoria that lasted a good while and started getting very chatty in short order. I believe this would be great for party.  After a couple of hours I became very relaxed in both mind and body. The smell is ...”"
Bf4guyseneca,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1780770,"“I got an 1/8 of this from a licensed store a little while ago. Apparently it was their best seller but I am not stoked. Had trouble keeping my joint lit and smell/taste kind of bland.”"
mattpetti,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1749191,"“Great taste and smell! Very good strain from Tweed!”"
IndustrialTreeHugger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1741798,"“Not a fan of this... it's bland with very little effects.  Apparently this is a strain that you either love or hate. If you are looking to get a heavy buzz, you won't find it here.”"
Xaxion,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1732439,"“Strong sativa effects which created a very pleasant head high. Definitely a strain I would buy again.”"
meg89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1742776,"“Pleasant high. Cerebral. 
Gets you into deep focus/thoughts. 
Not the best I’ve tried, however a nice strain overall. 
Was missing the energy factor. 
Pricey at $40+ but also the biggest bud and freshest date I’ve seen in a container yet!”"
RedRabbit33,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1733592,"“Really loving this strain. Picked up an 1/8th of it on 10/17 at Tweed and probably overdid it a bit on my first go around but it never got me paranoid or anxious. You know the feeling just before the anxiety and paranoia of a heavy THC strain kicks in? It mostly lingered there for me. Felt very relaxed but not couch locked, very insightful and thoughtful, a bit talkative if you ask my wife. She was trying to watch a ...”"
doubleEagle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1736056,"“Very up. Excellent bright high. I tried Tweed's 3.5 gram cannister.
There was a good skunk smell and THC crystals that were not sticky and rolled and smoked well. It had been in the cannister for about eight weeks. This was better than Sour Diesel in Denver.”"
8Sins,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1734484,"“This Canadian tried it for the first time last night and anyone knows me, knows I'm not a big talker. Don't say much. Wellllll, it cured that lol. Fun buzz, while watching a comedy on TV. Very enjoyable stone, with no heavy head after. I'll always have some of this on hand. It's a little harsh, small tokes were in order”"
Totoro90,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1732438,"“I found this strain made me energized, happy and giggly.  
 The taste is a bit powerful but I didn't dislike it.  I got a bit of a headache after smoking it for a while.”"
KingBitta,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1748002,"“Bought some of this the other day it's really good however; if you're coming off a tolerance break or haven't eaten before you smoke, than make sure you go slow, I smoked 2 bowls and greened out. Stuffs strong”"
keldoge,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1736735,"“Euphoric and somewhat stimulating. This would be a great strain to break out at social events. Might be good for moderate pain management. Doesn’t give me much of the munchies. My one gripe with this strain is the lack of mental focus I’m feeling from it. I look forward to using it before I go to the gym, however.

Smell is beautiful and on the heavier side. Smokes okay. Tastes good. Overall one of the better strains...”"
BeGloryOrPeace,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1764133,"“beautiful buds, very earthy, woody and old fuel scent to it... great high though”"
zaafiel,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1765563,"“Enjoyed this strain after a total hiatus of six years, celebrating the legalization of recreational use in Canada. Smoked several hand-rolled joints over three days, and the effect is consistent: A feeling of disconnection and lightness, with tingling sensations creeping from the body center outward. My eyes were squinting from dryness, and my mouth was ready to seal up from tongue thickness. It's marketed as activit...”"
Afro_ditee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1754011,"“I reacted poorly to this! It gave me a headache and made me more anxious. Also the high didn’t last for very long, to me it’s one you have to constantly keep vaping to feel high longer. I had 2grams of this and tried it at random times and still felt weird! Unfortunately I didn’t have CBD to counter its effects.”"

Dante4881,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1741065,"“Amazing terpenes that defy you to pick what they are. Fuelie and a little alien. The effect is hard hitting head punch that fades to general relaxation and minimal burnout.”"

Tristan7s,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1742032,"“Amazing Sativa dominate hydrid, very potent and my first recreational cannabis product. Bought from Tweed/Canopy Growth in Winnipeg. Labeled at 3.5 grams, 22% THC. Weighed it out once I got home and it weighed in at 3.3 grams. Not a huge deal but feels bad considering the $40 price tag. Smells great and has dense sticky buds. Don't grind too much or you'll jam your grinder up. One of few Sativas that helps relieve mo...”"
Dragon37,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1774506,"“One of my favourites. Great high and you can remain fairly productive. Definitely not a strain to fall asleep by but you won’t be bouncing off the walls. It should give you energy for several hours, ymmv though.”"
SirStromming,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1763246,"“Perhaps my personal favourite strain that is great for any time of day. I always love to wind down on a Sunday night with a joint or a blunt of it. Provides a great cerebral high, with a very light body high. 

Definitely worth a try, or in your regular rotation.”"
lorenzoburton4,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1769022,"“Great strain! Really uplifting and long euphoric head high that don’t make you crash would recommend to anyone! If you live in Canada you can pick it up at tweed.”"
NihilisticAmalgam,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1756961,"“Calming, uplifting high.  Sweet citrus odor. 

Got it at nova cannabis off Whyte Ave in Edmonton Alberta”"

Promark2112,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1771315,"“This strain probably would be better but unfortunately for me, it isn't very good. If you have anxiety, please do not smoke this strain. It will give you some bad anxiety and its really hard to control it. I imagine if you don't have anxiety that it would be a decent strain but I didn't like it at all.”"

NorthIce18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1785248,"“I recommend only smoking this in the morning.

Don't smoke this if you are planning to sleep within the next 5 hours. Smoking this too close to bedtime, can cause you to wake up with deep dark half circles under your eyes, that DON'T go away soon, if ever. Trust me, I speak from experience.

This weed is for mornings, but even then, it isn't good for productivity. You can't concentrate well at all, and is more like d...”"

Enkiduxd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1760361,"“Was gifted some of this strain by a close friend. Could smell the citrus upon opening the container, but upon smoking it produced a much nicer, almost pleasant citrus smell. Very enjoyable - yet light - high to an almost exclusively indica consumer. I'll definitely be buying this strain again. Was worried about paranoia that came with sativas before, but I felt no paranoia at all upon smoking. Not sure if that's beca...”"
Royford,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/donegal/reviews/1774323,"“Can't get enough of this sativa dominant beauty. Smells so good I almost don't want to smoke it. It smells like when a freshly opened poured soda fizzes in your face or a bottle of Gojo. 
It burns aromatically too, if you're complaining of the smell, I doubt you got primo plant.
The taste is cool and it's hands down the most fruity flavoured flower I've experienced.
Euphoric high. You can definitely over do it but th...”"

Me and a couple friends tried this which ended with us all napping hah

Wasn’t a huge fan of the taste but it did get us high, however, was not properly informed during purchase”"
