The Blueberry aroma was really, really muted - not what I remember the "true" Blueberry to be at all.

I bought a  Single gram to try, and instantly went back for the 3.5g for $28. This stuff smell just like blueberries, more than any other single weed I have smoked. On the exhale it tastes just like blueberry pancakes. It provides a nice relaxing high. It's a very functional Indica.”"

Doesn't 'put' you to sleep, but you just want to get comfortable, lay in bed, cuddle up with lots of blankets, and watch tv in bed then pass out later.  I don't remember this helping me with any type of pain.  It did put a cold sensation in my entire body though, like I felt cold inside.

First off the high is quite heavy and heady. It was a concentrate an advertised between 75 + 85% THC. The flavor was blueberry like almost too much blueberry for me, I like a little gas in mine. This tasted like some super blueberry from outer space that left me me...”"
