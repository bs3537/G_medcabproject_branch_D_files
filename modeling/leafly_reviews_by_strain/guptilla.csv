Sugarbush811,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guptilla/reviews/1693487,"“The best strain for anxiety. No feeling of panic or loss of control whatsoever. (I tend to get panicky on sativas and don't like some indicas because of how sedating they are). I have tried many strains- preferring indicas and this is my favorite. Seriously love this strain. It's so relaxing and healing to the body and mind.”"

A nice long pleasant stone that leaves you with a shit-eating grin for at least 2 euphoric hours.  A happy high for sure that is also very relaxing.  NO paranoia for sure.  No doubt a good old fashioned STONED effect.

It's so good that I am going to the dispensary to fork out $100 for 6 regular seeds to hopefully get at least one goo...”"

BDover211,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guptilla/reviews/1432778,"“Im reviewing the sugar wax concentrate of this strain in a Dr. Dabber Aurora, quartz atomizer, heat setting green (lowest). Right away the flavor comes on a little fruity with big big back of throat sticky turbine residue. Surprisingly, for me, the high takes a bit to come on, but when it hits, and throughout the duration of the peak, it is nothing but mad super up euphoria. Very kid-like cerebral high (riding bikes ...”"

arsanche12,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guptilla/reviews/1731573,"“this is a super strong indica. I really only like it for falling asleep cuz that's exactly what it makes me do. I cant smoke it if I have plans to do something cuz I'll get too tired.”"
Startide,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guptilla/reviews/1483512,"“Fantastic strain. I definitely got that pepper taste with this, and a little bit of a creeping high. Not overly though. There was a bit of couch lock which was great cause my work days have been long lately. When the high begins to wind down, it'll bring in that really heavy sleepy feeling. This is a very sleepy time strain. But definitely my new favorite.”"

MatterOfFact,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guptilla/reviews/1534297,"“I recently saw this at Organic Alternatives in Fort Collins and gave it a try because of it's unique flavor and genetics. I couldn't have been more satisfied.

The flavor could be confused for it's parent, Gorilla Glue, if not for the powerful peppery flavor, which is delightful.

The smoke is quite harsh and can become a milky yellow as your bowl burns down. I found myself hacking up a bit of tar from my throat in t...”"
