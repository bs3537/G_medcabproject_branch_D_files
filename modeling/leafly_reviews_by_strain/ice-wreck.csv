BarkleyHighEh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1397140,"“I've been a very heavy smoker for many years now, so I can almost always handle a little chronic. That being said, after taking a hit of this strain, I proceed to be very "wrecked". For some reason every time I smoke this strain one of my eyes seems to droop and well I can say this; don't use this strain if you are trying to be discreet about being high. I ended up getting stoned before a dinner with my girlfriends f...”"

justagirltm,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1371493,"“I highly recommend this strain to those who enjoy to toke and get work done with a lil body buzz just enough to move your body in a zenful nature.  The light cerebral high adds to creative wonderment when using this sativa dominant.  The body buzz from the small amount of indica give is super light and just enough to feel like clouds are floating you through your day.

EMJW,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1354240,"“I tried this strain for the first time last night in the form of live resin.. WOW was that intense! The taste was lightly piney with a sweet note but I didn't detect any citrus. It hit me hard almost paralyzing me with a heavy body high but my mind was clear and I felt mentally energized. After I recovered a bit I paced around my house but admittedly I wasn't doing anything that could even slightly be considered usef...”"

AB4471,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1446656,"“Great wake and bake strain that provides a relaxing and happy uplift to your day without going over the top... perfect for watching the clouds dance through the sky this hybrid is the perfect awake and allllright strain for an groovy morning.”"
THE_DOG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1351741,"“Ice Wreck, by Crop King Seeds is a cross between Trainwreck and Ice, making an exceptional knockout strain for any time of the day.

Ice Wreck is a perfect 50/50 hybrid, providing full on body effects with the accompanying head high.

This strain tastes great in a vaporizer and smells great as well.

I would recommend this strain to any patients with chronic pain or amnesia, but will impress anyone who gives it a try...”"
jangaroo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1369633,"“This has probably been one of my least favorite strains in terms of harshness and bad taste of the smoke. 
The buds I got were starting to get a little dry to me so this could be why it was unenjoyable.

I've been smoking daily and this one is the only strain that makes me cough and leaves me with a sore/dry throat.
when inhaling it, the smoke is so harsh along with a bad chemical/pine/diesel taste that lingers.

Evanzyker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1456715,"“Really cool strain. The high is strong but smooth and pleasant. I smoke around 50g/month and this weed is one of the few that still get me high. I don't recommend this strain for beginners since you can feel a bit paranoid or dizzy.
Otherwise, the taste is fresh and a bit fruity.  It's definitely a good weed to smoke after work or while chilling with friends !
Evanzyker's hint: If sativa strains already make you anxi...”"
BowenIsland,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1721483,"“Did you ever wonder what it would be like to be hit by a train engineered by Wavy Gravy? This potent 50/50 hybrid of Ice & Trainwreck will satisfy your curiosity. 
This is not for beginners.  When you light up or vape, you will notice a earthy mint with a touch of chemical flavor. The aroma is a earthy and a little skunky.  But that's not it's best feature. It's the "euphoria" that hits hard and fast. It starts off v...”"
iHeartVancouver,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1325282,"“Good strain! Definitely feel it in your head physically and mentally. Only complaint is that it gave me a bit of a headache. A good one for euphoria but not so much pain relief.”"
Teeman6565,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1779506,"“The best of both worlds describes this strain perfectly. This is now one of my favourite strains. It has a piney,woodsy aroma with a hint of earthiness. When you break a bud open you are treated to a spicy almost incense like fragrance. The taste is simply amazing, on inhale there is a acrid chemical mixed with mint or menthol taste. On exhale a piney peppery flavour emerges. 
 This one hits you right away with a str...”"
muggzymoo1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1605666,"“I would definitely recommend this strain for writers block. Being a musician I definately hit writers block from time to time with work schedule etc. For body pain relief though it doesnt do too much for me in that sense so that's why i'm giving it a four, maybe it depends on what form you smoke it in. It is creeper as well. I rolled a ring finger width and got 3 1/4 through and am feeling pretty good, intense cerebe...”"

Maybe it just isn't a good batch but this is from where I get the best stuff so not sure. My tolerance is higher than almost anyone's, so there's that too but I found little to no relief for my particular conditions.”"
breannayn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1516657,"“This strain reminds me of smoking by a campfire. As my first courier delivery I was not disappointed in the quality! Wonderful body high is almost immediate. Pains start to melt away, even the stubborn sciatica. At the beginning of the joint there was a lot of coughing but seems to be pretty smooth overall. It’s winter outside, but the cold doesn’t bother me after about half of this half-gram joint! Up there with my ...”"

falsettomaster,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1781786,"“Love this. Hints of blueberry and iciness in the smell. Perfect for winter. Feels amazing, makes me sleep really deep. Only downside, it stimulates my mind which sometimes keeps me awake if I smoke too much right before bed.”"
Bud expert,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1587055,"“Im currently glued to the couch as i sit here not even wanting to go to the fridge for food...and reviewing during the high.

  I smoked a medium filled zig zag (didnt weigh it). Im feeling good but still lucid enough to write about it.   The taste is citrusy and woodsy.  This bud is stanky so if you dont want your environment smelling like that put it in a jar.”"
shumz420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1614466,"“hits hard in the vaporizer - has a menthol kinda aftertaste.  grabbed a bit for the wknd...vaping away as i type as the mind starts to become a playground.
happy 420!”"
bennijenni,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1751525,"“Excellent for the joint and muscular pain I deal with. There are very few strains that actually help me in this regard (lots claim to but, then tend to worsen my pain). I am a person who also is challenged with acute anxiety at times - this chilled me right out and kept me in a positive frame of mind. I have fibromyalgia & PTSD and would highly recommend it to anyone with challenges like this.”"
Mirstan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1696893,"“May take a while for the full effect to kick in - it creeps up on you. Definitely best experienced with a friend, as it makes you giggly and social. I shared a joint with her, and I almost felt drunk. 
So fun”"
KushGypsy420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1345147,"“Pretty gnarly strain. It literally put me on my ass. I have been smoking for almost ten years( being a regular smoker for 7 ) and I wouldn't recommend this to newbs. Lots of getting stuck in my head. I give it four stars because the taste is not bad and it's the best sleep I have had in a while. Cheers 💤.”"
Mayari99,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1273190,"“Not too bad. There's definitely something different about it that sets it apart from other strain. Nothing like Ive ever really tasted before. It has an almost minty/frost taste to it and tastes quite earthy. Its definitely earned its title.”"
newfiehigh709,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-wreck/reviews/1637472,"“i dont like to be high in my head. And this stran is very comfortable, although i smoked half a medium sized hand rolled joint. my body is completly relaxed. i have a pinched nerve in my neck and there is little pain right now. I just want to be watching TV. And the head high  ( for me ) is functional.”"

It felt like it opened up my mind whilst still allowing my to relax.. Unfortunately it also made my anxiety 10x worse. My fiancé had no negative side effects, whilst I had the worst anxiety attack of my life because he changed the shower water temperature on me. It didn't happen right awa...”"
