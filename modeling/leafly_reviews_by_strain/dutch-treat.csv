Dutch Treat
=============
Tempest83,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat/reviews/1415875,"“One of the very best "calm you down, take a load off" strains. As long as I have been keeping track, this strain has been a favorite. Faced with 20-30 strains, almost always a choose this because it reliably calms, soothes and improves mood. Stress reduced, mind relaxer.”"
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat/reviews/1417338,"“Very very nice.  Erases anxiety and puts you in a blissful, relaxed and uplifted mood. Late afternoon thru early evening would be the optimal times to induge, although I might try it in the morning just to see what it would be like when you're fresh... I would definitely purchase this strain again.”"

A Master grower in Bellingham WA. brought the seeds over to the US and grew all 10 of them.  Word has it that these were some "special" behind the counter seeds that were offered to make up for a previous bad purchase several months before that wasted the growers time. Out of the 10 seeds that were l...”"

The weed smells amazing - pine and spearmint, with a bit of earth. The smoke is light and gave me no urge to cough, and tasted of earth and menthol, with just a bit of piney hops in the background. Very nice.

The high was also top notch. It began with a clear, very happy head-high. No fogginess and no racey sens...”"

It's been awhile, but I remember it being a hit w/ my friends and I over the summer. As most have mentioned here, it's s potent Sativa dominant hybrid. It's maybe a bit too potent for my daytime preferences, in fact. I have anxiety, and find that strong Sativas like this one can actually make it worse. I prefer a more balanced hybrid like Cinex or Blue Dream. Tha...”"

The high always starts off with a sativa like head rush in and behind the eyes, and transfers (you can literally feel it)  to the body with a slight buzz in the head as well. It is mildly strong the two times I've used it despite looking gourgeous and trichomey. Would love to try a high THC batch...”"

Regardless, it is a great relaxer and stress reliever. Not sure about pain. It provides a euphoric head high, that after some time turns to a slight body buzz before tapering off. Definitely one of the most unique looking and smelling strains I've ever had. I think this particular batch had been sitting around, possibl...”"
Herbalmagician,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat/reviews/1356378,"“Wow! This strain blew me away!! A very strong high that hits the brain initially with an abrupt psychedelic metal shift, very euphoric. Also possesses a comfortably numb body buzz. Strong smelling flowers, with what others have described as a unique eucalyptus scent that also called to mind sandalwood and menthol, all of which come through in the delicious flavor against a sweet, earthy, piney backdrop. 
Very attract...”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat/reviews/1410039,"“Definitely one of the most flavorful strains I've come across, with earthy plant taste from the inhale lingering after the exhale. The nugs are smallish, covered in reddish hairs, and a dark green underneath; Definitely Indica-heavy. Great for relieving stress, and just mellowing out watching TV or doing some light-intensity activity. Might be too lazy for super active stuff. The buzz is short-lived, and I couldn't i...”"

I'm an big Indica guy, and usually late night to get to sleep. With that said - this strain was awesome for day time hanging out. This is the most uplifting, happy and clean high I've had.

With earthy, piney, and lemony tones, the exhales comes off very sweet, not a bit of smokeyness, and left my mouth watering and wanting more.

It is relaxing, but let's be real here, it's marijuana, of course it's relaxing. It's a very unusual high... I've noticed it every time I buy this stuff, it doesn't smoke like other strains. I don't personally feel much of a body effect. I do get fatigued, but it doesn't do much for pain. The headspace could be great for some people, but it doesn't sit well...”"

I adore the outdoorsy pine perfume and how one pea size hit can keep my symptoms in check. I found my strain match made in heaven at Moss Crossing dispensary in Eugene Oregon.

The smell is incredible, especially when breaking it up, and it's sure to be a recognizable one in the future. My guess is that it's an indica dominant, made me real sleepy and just complacent. Excellent weed.”"
