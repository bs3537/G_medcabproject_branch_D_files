cbdqueen88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/luca-brasi-x-sour-diesel/reviews/1261482,"“This is a nice, mellow, productive high. Relieves my anxiety and good for meditation. I'm sensitive, and it didn't make me feel too high. Present, focused, relaxed.”"
ript2shrds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/luca-brasi-x-sour-diesel/reviews/1348342,"“LivWell was selling this strain to Veterans last Memorial  Day (all week actually) for a penny an ounce. I use CBD for spinal injury and PTSD, so this strain does the trick. Everyone does it their own way, but for me this strain is a little too harsh and the THC is too low, so what I do is just throw some of this in the grinder with my high THC flower of choice, or cover a bowl of this with some concentrates. I also ...”"

shawneric101,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/luca-brasi-x-sour-diesel/reviews/1238235,"“a down to earth, relaxing hi, that does not make you feel like you have to fall asleep or sit down and be lazy. I can still get the whole place cleaned up and enjoy the buzz at the same time”"
PTSDVet7388,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/luca-brasi-x-sour-diesel/reviews/1243590,"“I like this strain in smaller amounts smoking or great for cooking.  It does get me up and going like a good cup of coffee but I noticed that with the pain relief there can be some anxiety if I am not careful about the amount I consume.  I only use this strain in the morning or if I need to do something creative or that requires energy and focus.  I recommend this strain for my PTSD veteran brothers and sisters as a ...”"

The 30% CBD give a relaxing body high that helps with pain, and the sativa dominance is great for relieving depression and giving a nice kick of energy. This is definitely one of my favorite strains!”"
OldToby214,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/luca-brasi-x-sour-diesel/reviews/1246918,"“I remember liked this strain, but honestly the combination of the 2 strains is less than spectacular. The high is alright, but if you have a high tolerance, then this is not the right combo for you. I vaped this as a concentrated wax and it got me dupe stoned, but nothing really grabbed me during the high.”"
kushimaru,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/luca-brasi-x-sour-diesel/reviews/1233369,"“Pretty good from what I've had👍🏾 nice pleasant head high but not too heavy. Great for burning and then getting something done. If your #teamsour or even a newcomer then this is for you. Taste, smell & burn 💯”"

LauraFMilham,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/luca-brasi-x-sour-diesel/reviews/1253828,"“Perfect for the best of both worlds in that you feel super relaxed yet can still function productively.  High doesn't last as long though so best for taking a puff every 1-2 hours to maintain slight buzz while getting things done in a happy, steady, focused mode.  No overkill munchies here either, which is why I personally seek out sativa dominant strains.”"
budwiserog,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/luca-brasi-x-sour-diesel/reviews/1304933,"“I am a newbie to weed and wanted to find a strain that would help me sleep and give me pain relief for my back.  This was the strain recommended and it works like a charm! It's very enjoyable high and keeps my mind at ease. With the vape the weed tastes delicious. Skunky weed with some lemon on the exhale. If you have any pain def try this out!”"
Jillis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/luca-brasi-x-sour-diesel/reviews/1315981,"“I absolutely love this strain! Best weed for pain n energy with mellow head high. Gives me great pain relief n I have many issues of pain all over all the time n anxiety the list goes on. This is one that gives me no anxiety which is rare for me. It's great to get me up to wake n bake n get things done. I cannot find it a lot only one place I know of carries it n they rarely have it. Livwell is only one I know of. Bu...”"

I don't do well with sativas, that energetic feeling makes me panic instantly but I kept hearing that high cbd strains are good for anxiety so I thought I'd give it a try. There is definitely a high to this, I feel the head buzz from the thc but it is still very clear headed and it has some of that sativa energy that makes it a bit uncomfortable. Thinking I should stick to...”"

With just a few small bowls, I was almost completely pain free and, my mind was in a clear but relaxed state. I would recommend this strain to anyone seeking quick-acting and long lasting pain relief.”"
