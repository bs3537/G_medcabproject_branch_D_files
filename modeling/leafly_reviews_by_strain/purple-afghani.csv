allgovernmentsLIE,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1375513,"“It has that stinky, cheesy, musty, dank smell, like Ingrid or UK Cheese.

My microscope inspection revealed plenty of gorgeous, matured trichromes that were either perfectly clear or hazy and sugary-looking. EXCELLENT for anxiety, and I have no doubt that it will help me sleep incredibly well tonight.”"
Califoregonian,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1375723,"“When grown right, this is possibly the best Indica-dominant medical strain out there. Pungent, sweet earthy smell not unlike a combination of coffee and berries, smoke is delicious, rich, spicy and sweet. Beautiful, multicolored buds tinged with purple, just dense enough to be easy to break up for smoking. Smokes well every which way-- joints, bingers, pipes, bubblers, you name it. Medically it's my go-to strain, the...”"

redsox21,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1547997,"“I always say my favorite time to smoke is when I'm sick, and I currently have the flu and this one is bad! Purple afghani completely took away the pain and headaches. I haven't really gotten any sleep the past few days so I can't wait for this to hit me like a freight train ( I dabbed it) lol”"
bekkah420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1353855,"“Very tasty co2. Very gentle come on with awesome relaxing and calming properties. Not overpowering or too heavy, yet great pain relief and calmness. So far no anxiety or paranoia that I've been getting from the purple strains of concentrate lately.
Highly recommended for after work and winding down before bed.”"
nanobear,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1213939,"“First off, let me just say that this is one of the best strains that I've ever had the opportunity to try. Oh, where to begin. I guess I should start with the taste. It's got a distinct flowery taste, stronger than most strains. It hits like a dream. The high is almost instant, and comes on strong, pretty much every time. I LOVE this strain. The effect lasts longer than any other strain I've tried so far, but I'm alw...”"
Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1137251,"“Just had my first taste of this and I like it a lot.  Great rich fruity scent and nice taste.  The effects creeped up on me and lasted a long time.  Classic Indica, nice body sensations, dreaminess and completely relaxing.  Doesn't make me inoperable, but I thought it was fairly strong.”"

Irish91,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1137248,"“A very strong pungent afghani smell and taste. Honeycomb dabs that are very beautiful. Goes right to the head and makes me sleepy and stoned.”"
Apoetyouknow,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1064263,"“I bought some of this bud today from a local cannabis club and it was a great choice for mid shelf. Strong indica effects, helped with sleep and I have a very strong tolerance so it was a suprise that it hit me as well as it did.”"
novite,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1191898,"“Personally, this strain makes me pretty nonfunctional. It makes me feel really groggy, and makes it difficult for me to be productive. This is definitely going to be a 'smoke this before bed' kind of strain for me. I'm inclined to avoid smoking this when I have anything I really want to get done after smoking, aside from passing out or mellowing way out. 

That being said, this strain is fantastic for just mellowing ...”"
Atrent3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1503956,"“Amazing strain, it'll make you feel amazing. Your sleep will be on a cloud. Your days will be a daze. Gotta try it at least once.”"

vitormolica,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1593040,"“Nice strain , I prefer sativa instead of indica, because sometimes I feel the sensation that my body is heavy. But I cant say the same for this one, I felt very relaxed and soft , nice feelings”"

NoRobo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1176736,"“I got this on the recommendation from the budtender for my free gram. Trichomes galore, and such a dank sweet smell. My nose kept going back to the jar, even if I was about to smoke something else. The high was a nice floaty feeling, very euphoric. When in a bad mood or super stressed out, give this one a shout. Test results of my sample. 15.47% thc 0.0% cbd”"
hesamour,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1421779,"“Smoking this right now and it's beautiful. Smell is really sweet and fruity, and still sweet but earthy and smoky like coffee when smoked. Purple buds, dark and dense. I took 2 hits and started feeling it. My only complaint is that it's dry but it's still smoking great so not complaining! Definitely would recommend if you want pain relief and relaxation without being put to sleep or completely confused the whole time...”"
smj1003,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1203469,"“Nice bud if you wanna relax, not the best for doing activities as it makes you pretty sleepy. A heavy body high and kind of a numb cerebral high, leaves you feeling pretty stoned.”"

tenonesixty,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1269590,"“this strain is one of the only kinds of co2 oil I've smoked that will give me paranoia and rapid heart beat if you smoke too much. it's fine if you just have 1 hit of it but it's so easy to over smoke. one night I hit it 3 times and tried to go to bed and I had lots of trouble breathing, it was kind of scary. too strong to just smoke like its nothing, be very very careful with this one. a little goes a long way. try ...”"

Positive_Train,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1288086,"“Just got done burning this about an hour ago and boy was it just what I needed. Nice mellow indica to sit on after a long day at work. Great high that caused sleepiness but did not tranquilize me like some other strong indicas.”"

NeauxDoubt,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1348605,"“Just a great strain for so many medical uses. 

RA/AS patient with two collapsed lumbar discs. 

This strain can replace my muscle relaxer and helps me stay on NSAIDs and OFF opiates. Great for relaxing your mind and body. 

I never pass up an opportunity to snag this in shatter.”"
Sjburke25,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1064240,"“Beautiful flower under notes in the taste with spectacular expansion. Not a one hitter style medicine that kicks right away but with a mellow creep and a strong long lasting body effect. Great Indica medicinal effect.”"

jeahisaidit,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1146105,"“The call to sleep was strong with this strain. I recall several occasions where I woke up unaware that I had fallen asleep. This strain is a great pain/insomnia medicine but take with caution, many plans were thwarted while medicating with this strain. MS patients may appreciate the intense sleep it brings about.”"
Jamesfud,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1774882,"“Got this wonderful stank to it. And not stank in a bad sense, no skunk all just earth. LOVE that shit. Shit smells like cultivated soil, like damn. 
I almost always cough when smoking just because my lungs suck and I'm always on the woods but this was incredibly smooth on the back of my throat. A nice, easy smoke. I was definitely very paranoid and anxious at first but you mellow out significantly as the indica sets ...”"
The.Avid.Dabber,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-afghani/reviews/1145600,"“From Emerald City Organics. 18% total cannabinoids, was one of the strongest on the menu. smooth, flavorful smoke, mellow effects left a little to be desired but still a very enjoyable strain.”"

A few puffs of this and my body and my eyelids were both glued down :) It stopped my brain from firing all cylinders at the same time and made it difficult to hold thoughts. This is exactly what I need because my brain usually won't let me go to sleep. The doctor prescribes sleeping pills, but then I am still sleepy until after 1pm the next day.

However, when you have Chronic Pain or Depression, you have to super cool the smoke with Ice and Purolator/Recycler/Bubbler Ice Bong it: i.e. heavy on chest/throat.
