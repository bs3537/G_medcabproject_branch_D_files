I felt very blunted, euphoric and uplifted. Had somewhat of a headache before I smoked it but it was one hundred percent gone by the time i was done smoking. 

I recommend this strain to anyone who might have a higher tolerance (like me) than the average patient. D...”"

Mostly popular in western europe and south africa.”"
gigaza,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/double-diesel/reviews/1269142,"“very airy light high. little to no head pressure or body vibes unlike many other strains.

This bud is actually quite energizing, it's not something i would use before sleeping. 

I usually expect diesels to make me cough heavily, but this one is not so rough. It smokes like some good standard bud, nothing super special, just easy and quick... a good daily driver for most situations. Not paranoia inducing like ot...”"

This one tastes and smells like you sliced open a fresh grapefruit and poured some gas on the inside. I Love the Diesel strains. This one has been recently added to my arsenal for morning medicine.

sproutly,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/double-diesel/reviews/1314219,"“I was able to read while high on this. I've never had that experience before. Usually I'll realize I've read the same paragraph a few times but forgotten the beginning by the time I hit the ending. With this strain I read a whole book. I was definitely lifted, but not stupid. 

Highly recommended for daytime use.”"

Dude was on point with his recommendation, didn't last long but grabbed me by the balls and didn't let go for an hour or two. I'll get 2 grams next time”"

Strong lemon taste as described, w a hint of something I can't describe. Helping quite a bit with my pain. Taking my 3rd hit. It's very uplifting. Coughing my ass off too. Would recommend”"

I blew through an 1/8 in a day and I NEVER do that. I literally felt almost nothing and it didn't even taste like anything no earth, no pine, no nothing, just blah. My friend came over and we matched bowls and she was like, this tastes like nothing. I said, I know it's weird! It was supposed to be top shelf. But again I do...”"
