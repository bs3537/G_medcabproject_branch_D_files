The Wife

Andizlack,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1488079,"“Full review below, but for anybody with severe pain wondering about which strain to get, or to even whether to get a medical card at all, for pain relief via medical marijuana, it's my goal in this diatribe to sing amazing praises this single strain has done for my physical, and consequently, mental health in the 2 years since I've started using it.

I made an account here just to comment on this strain. Of the 11 re...”"
alpinent,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1416363,"“This is my first (nearly) pure CBD strain. Rich, slightly sweet smell and taste. It truly gave me a deep body high—warm, relaxed, tingling—with zero head high. An incredible option for those seeking to capitalize on the medical benefits of cannabis while keeping a crystal clear mind.”"
Anne5280,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1416362,"“I mix this in about every vape bowl I pack. It seems oilier or more moist than other flower and the effect is it gives off amazing vapor clouds and all one would expect from a CBD " back." While other cbd strains tend to smell and taste like shit, The Wife smells Amazing. Def try if CBD is your thang!”"
g303man,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1416365,"“I recently tried the wife and really enjoyed this strain.  The taste was outstanding wonderful sweet cherry taste.  The high is a great body high felt really relaxed and very at ease.  I lean more towards the high CBD strains I found these strains to be very good for easing my arthritis pain.  I would recommend The Wife for any one who is looking for a great body high but still needs to stay focused and functional.”"
kgrabowski0206,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1487276,"“I was so skeptical of cannabis helping with pain at all after trying so many different strains that didn’t work. I have chronic pain in my neck,shins, and knees at the age of 34 but have a physical job(chef), and love being active. Arthritis in my neck, herniated disk,and dehydrated disks. So tired of pain meds so we made the trip to Denver and tried The Wife and so happy  I did. I’m not a fan of being medicated all ...”"
Wightknight,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1416368,"“For starters, everything said about this strain is spot on.  People utilizing cannabis as medicine, from pain relief to stress reduction it's a splendid strain.
That said.  Why is it called wife?  Well as a grower it's a bitch.  Very demanding compared to other recreation type genetics.  Requires a different nutrient mix as well as light type and cycle.   
Obviously a strain with a 20/1 CBD/THC it will need special a...”"
surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1416364,"“Mellow buzz allows one to pursue pending agendas. Great pain med with CBD lvls off the chart. Yummy tangy, cherry flavors and pungent, sweet aromatic profile. 

Shoulder pain diminished 
Mind set free
Cramps relieved 
Mellow THC effects”"
toast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1416366,"“Amazing medical strain. Smells sweet and fruity. I love it so much I made some infused coconut oil with The Wife. She takes care of all my bodily needs. A few puffs and my pain disappears.”"
VoodooIdol,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1685628,"“THE WIFE ever man, woman in pain needs a loving wife!!!!

Traceypooh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1442209,"“Love this strain. It has a nice taste and makes you feel energetic and in my experience lowers my pain.  My favorite flower so far. I'm a fan of the Sativa strains.”"
HawaiianGoldfish,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1416367,"“I have nerve damage and muscle spasms and the wife has quickly become my everyday flower. It keeps me clear headed and awake while delivering pain management.”"
Mudd3.141592,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1718941,"“This strain has every medical relief I have. Stress,Pain,muscle spasms,  migranes. And I'm known to get anxious and slightly paranoid snd this strain has none of them. There is only one bad symptom, dry eyes. That's amazing!! Everyone has their own views on every strain. This one is my absolute favorite  hands down. Lots of medical relief and super low adverse symptoms. If your in my boat make it a point to try this ...”"
Koopday,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1525520,"“I've tried a few CBD strains and this is the one I have ended up finding the most pain relieving. As a matter of fact, it is top notch pain killer when smoked; direct, no psycho activity due to not even 1% thc, it is highly relaxing due to immediate onset of magical CBD! I have bad back spasms and cramps since a second serious car wreck, years ago, and this is the most affective solution for mild-chronic pain... and ...”"
Thewizzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1416369,"“I got from a t.c.s and its awesome. Works great for seisures . Smelled kinda funky and a little dry but overall great.”"
beversolt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1780031,"“Amazing. Like another person wrote, this strain is excellent for pain. High THC gets my nerves in an uproar, making my pain worse. I suffer from degenerative disc disease, with bulging discs, running from neck to lower back. I also have severe scar tissue from a radical bi lateral mastectomy which causes severe pain, and high THC also disturbs the nerves in that. The Wife is an excellent choice for pain problems, its...”"
SamanthaWillGirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1469180,"“I was looking for Cannatonic when a Terrapin budtender recommended this strain. I love it! This strain is an excellent way to enjoy flower without getting too stoned or worrying about failing a drug test.  It is an extremely relaxing strain.  I would buy as much as you can and share with a friend.”"
NHCannaguy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1687693,"“Awesome strain, im a CBD user and this strain helps with my back and knee pains. To me i think its a little rich in the thc you feel it more than some other strains but overall and excellent strain smooth smoking also”"
Scooze007,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1738920,"“I have used The Wife serval Times. I get it for Chronic pain. I can tell you it works. I like it a lot. One of the products I use. It has helped me. I use the flower to vape. It works. It’s priced reasonable. Good strain.”"
ech76,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1730194,"“I have often had to use weed medicinally for two health conditions, and it’s always helped immensely... however after trying the wife, all other strains can’t even compare. It truly provided the best relief for my conditions that I’ve ever had from a strain. Highly recommend trying it!”"
naner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1740865,"“I learned about The Wife about 8 weeks ago and have been a regular user ever since.  I dislike the anxiousness and paranoia that accompanies high THC strains so The Wife is a great alternative.  When you smoke The Wife all stress melts away after an intense day at work yet you are completely functional.  Positive results include a slight euphoric feeling, relaxation, it makes me a little more talkative, all the more ...”"
CaptainQuazar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1726255,"“The Wife was my first CBD strain. It had a dark, fruity flavor and produced a dense vapor. I enjoyed it while also using an Indica strain at the end of the day, so my perception of the effect may be tainted. I felt relaxed and hope it helps me sleep tonight. Pairs nicely with Salmon River OG #4.”"
BermudaHighway,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1731807,"“I've heard this strain was called "The Wife" because of how difficult it is to grow, but to me it's "The Wife" because it's getting brought along to everything. Any flower I find too speedy I mix it with this to mellow it out. I do prefer having THC in my medicine, but I love how I can use this to keep the high THC strains from setting off any anxiety. It's my foundation to almost every vape pack.”"
Mar1234,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1695261,"“very smooth, very little to know head high. body felt super relaxed and chill. my patients was at an all time high and it felt great. this is deffinetly somthing you could smoke through the day and feel great. visibly my wife didnt even know I smoked somthing.”"
Funyuns,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1721548,"“I thoroughly enjoyed this strain for pain and anxiety relief. Very earthy flavor from a vaporizer, nice mellow effects. Almost zero psychoactivity. Good strain for when you want to medicate but have important stuff to do!”"
Hondo13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1722140,"“Best cbd strain i have had beside mystery 98. Has a sour, skunky, pungent yet sweet flower smell. It tastes amazing. The buds glisten. A beautiful green with tight dense buds. This stuff relaxes me like no other.”"
BobbyBluBlan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1692694,"“Absolutely loved this strain flavor was great upon the first hit my whole face was tingly which only lasted a minute but the overall relief of anxiety and pain was amazing as well definitely recommend this for anytime use”"

Mudbloom,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1794412,"“This strain hands down is the best I have ever had! As most people are I am a fan of thc but this cbd changed my whole understanding of proper cannabis use. I first got it from a delivery system in Toronto on a whim when my medical supplier had zip and it quickly became apart of my every sesh for it's flavours, smell, uplifting energy and it's impeccable ability to ease pain, nausea and anxiety. 

Unfortunately I hav...”"
KeefHunter420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-wife/reviews/1696685,"“All I can say is that I love everything Terrapin makes. I usually use Lemon G but this really hits my joint inflammation hard!! Instant relief. The wife grinded up with some Sabotage OG is the remedy!!”"
