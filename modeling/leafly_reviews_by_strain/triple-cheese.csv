bestmeds,https://www.leafly.com/indica/triple-cheese/reviews/1393555,"“Triple cheese from Barney's Farm is a potent medical strain...have no doubt. The taste was more like grape cheese than anything else...with a couch lock effect. Very good and tasty meds like most farm products. old breeders know how to do it right. my sample was rated at 23% THC. If you happen across this one...get it!!”"
FireMarshallBill,https://www.leafly.com/indica/triple-cheese/reviews/1393556,"“Reminiscent of UK original - but with a hint of blueberry/citrus notes. Smells wonderful, then knocks you flat on your ass. A+”"
IndigenousFarms,https://www.leafly.com/indica/triple-cheese/reviews/1384353,"“Great cheese aroma with couch locking effect. Great for insomnia and pain reliever. Tall plant and easy to grow.”"
Ikey28,https://www.leafly.com/indica/triple-cheese/reviews/1392271,"“Smell is nasty. Taste is fine; tastes like cheese being cooked on an outdoor grill. Vision is very shimmery, feeling is numbing, yet euphoric. Energetic, but relaxed.”"
levitaylor78,https://www.leafly.com/indica/triple-cheese/reviews/1389693,"“very close to original cheese in the UK I had early 2000. But this one is sweeter in taste. long lasting high and a breeze to grow. one of the best cheese strains on the market and I've been through a few trying to capture that original taste.”"
matiou,https://www.leafly.com/indica/triple-cheese/reviews/1391921,"“Triple cheese is the crossing of Blue Cheese with the Original Cheese (Skunk#1 phenotype), created over many generations of selections and backcrossing to give this strain. Triple Cheese is easy to grow and produces dense buds with a remarkable sweet blueberry, Old Cheese and earthy pungent skunk taste. The undisputable dank cheese flavour dominates this strain.”"
InfiniteDR3AMER,https://www.leafly.com/indica/triple-cheese/reviews/1462015,"“This is my second 5 star review and it earned every single one of them. I didn't know what to expect  and it was an EXTREMELY giggly, uplifting, relaxing high. You could use this for sleeping or daytime activities. I couldn't stop walking around but as soon as I would sit I was comfortable there too. I was extremely creative and talkative. Very nice strain. Will most likely grow this and "Sunshine" my next grow.”"

italianstallion91,https://www.leafly.com/indica/triple-cheese/reviews/1462734,"“So cheesy. Super relaxing and heavy. Started up a fever for a minute, then went into a soothing body high. Like I was wrapped in fleece fresh out of the dryer. Feeling a little slow on this. 
Nice earthy background that can get a little sour too. I will definitely get more.”"

stephisburns,https://www.leafly.com/indica/triple-cheese/reviews/1780433,"“This is my nighttime strain. So so good for my anxiety. Extremely relaxed, yet uplifted. Very strong odor, yet not as pugent of a taste. Your eyes are likely gonna get dry. The only downside really is the fact that your eyes get super dry.”"
jackpepper,https://www.leafly.com/indica/triple-cheese/reviews/1653893,"“So far this is my favorite indica ive got from lake effect. My bud tender did a great job telling about the strain and offered a very inviting smell. Once I had a chance to try it, it's kinda of a creeper. I was very pleased. I will be buy this strain again. I hope you get a chance to try it.”"
kdatta7,https://www.leafly.com/indica/triple-cheese/reviews/1558285,"“Very easy plant to grow. Flowered for 10wks. When the flowers are alive they smell like blueberries with a little funk. After drying and curing the smell turn into blueberries and a little sweet cream. Potent medical strain! My body was buzzing from head to my toes for hours.”"
