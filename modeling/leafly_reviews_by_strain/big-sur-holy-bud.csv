It has an amazingly potent terpine profile smelling of citrus, pine, and earth.  It was pretty trippy and make me appreciate light quality in a state of glittery awe.  The strain supported some good creative thought trains.  The buds are huge, and a little sloppy on the trim work, but beautiful none the less.  I would say the high is a little like super lemon haze, but a bit t...”"

It was a great smoke in both the neighboring Gabalin Santa Lucia mountains and across the Salinas valley. 
Well that was then and this is now . Meaning the strain that was once a heavy red headed bud is now a girthy kush hybrid that drops your song in the dirt and you don't mind it scraping. ...”"

I would describe it as sharp (I guess spicy) and sweet. My body felt very relaxed yet my mind bubbly!”"

Yowza. I ordered a half gram of some sugar concentrate trim run (Tested at 89% supposedly) of this stuff from a local delivery service who said it had been getting great reviews.

And I see why! Has a pinkish, sticky, crystallized/sugary texture to it, and a very sweet, STRONG, piney/woody scent!

And the flavor and effects are just absolutely out of this world. I dunno how this stuff is as f...”"

This bud was narly, and had that true sativa spicey side as well as a cool berry flavor. Now let me say I am picky ass mofo, like rly picky!  This bud rly had it all, the looks, taste, smell, and great high as well as being very medicating.  If you see this bud def. try it it's narly and a vry good representation of a "straight" sativa.”"
sfgiantsfan40,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1390918,"“Just bought a gram of Big Sur Holy Bud shatter, and I must say that this is one really great sativa strain. The head high is trippy while simultaneously helping me focus, and I find that it really boosts my creativity, It has just enough of a body high to put you into a very relaxed mood though. May have found my new daily strain in this bud.”"
lawofsin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1394175,"“These big leafy nugs were covered in glistening crystals and the effects were instant. It hits you between the eyes hard with a mind tingling buzz of euphoria and energy. Great as a day time smoke as long as you don't overdo it. The flavor is an earthy spice with a light minty sweetness on the exhale. Reminds me a bit of a diesel in effects and looks but with dark pink hairs”"

Smells great and is real dense, the high is a uplifting ,happy.
No couch lock at all.
A awesome strain but in my eyes not worthy of a 5 star.
Not enough trichs is my only con”"
czara,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1386882,"“The story goes that this strain was hybridized by a monk and cannabis enthusiast named Perry.  It certainly feels like it!  The flavor was citrusy and piney, reminiscent of a forest.  The high was extremely cerebral and trippy.  Relaxing enough to be great for pain relief, but I would definitely recommend it more for inspiration, creativity, and a slightly trippy experience.”"
Kengstro,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1386883,"“Happy high, really no negatives for me other than the smell is a bit mildewy. Doesn't look like its mold but still smells that way - ends on blueberry notes as advertised though.”"

SativyWonder,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1394169,"“The most unique bud I've ever experienced from a flavor standpoint. This stuff is spicy! Has a blackberry/jalapeno vibe. The high wasn't quite so distinct. Nice and clear, though, in my limited experience. I'd recommend picking up a small amount if you see it around just for the novelty of the flavor.”"
leemec,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1379720,"“This is one of the sleepiest Sativas I have ever been on. Its good for a genuine sense of relaxation and calm creative thought. I love it as a bong high. Not a fan of a bowl high though. Too much of a relaxant for everyday work and focus. I have not vaped it yet. I am wondering if I would like it more.”"
leemec,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1389455,"“In my opinion, when BSHB is vaped it provides a much cleaner high. It is a gentle quiet high good for keeping a clear head and low anxiety. There is very little sleepiness compared to when smoking the flower through a bong. Great for low key focused activities.”"

stacemus,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1414759,"“Hits you like a ton of bricks, fast. Has an earthy, taste with a piney finish. Not too harsh, smoothest when taken by water apparatus. Good for fatigue, motivation when achey and tight muscles when you have to keep going.
Impressive budlets with a great bang for the buck.”"

seamanjust13,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1291467,"“loved it! nice, pungent frangrance. very uplifting high that comes on strong and lasts about 2+ hours. very calming and great for anxiety.”"
Picasso2,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1244057,"“I got it because of the unique and strong smell. The smell was a little sweet, but the sweetness didn't come through when I smoked it. It made me cough more than usual I think. Besides the strong smell that grabbed my attention, it ended up just being average.

I wasn't sleepy, nor energized. Not a couch lock, but my head wasn't the clearest. Overall it's just a "somewhere in the middle" sativa.”"

celebrityskyn,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1372832,"“I was disappointed. I felt like I was smoking dirt and sticks. The earthy taste was novel at first but got old quickly. It took a lot to get me medicated and the effects were short-lived, under an hour. Smoking more didn't further medicate me. Won't be trying this again.”"
asdf1234,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/big-sur-holy-bud/reviews/1290224,"“Smells and looks like BC  bud.  Crap.  This was by far the worst cannabis I have bought in years and I paid the most I have ever paid for some herb.  This was grown by Kiona and bought at Uncle Ike's.  I had always wnated to try this famous stain, but dont be fooled.  WASTE OF MONEY.”"
