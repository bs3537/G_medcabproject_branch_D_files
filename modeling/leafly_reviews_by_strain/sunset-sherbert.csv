MsCannaGeek,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunset-sherbert/reviews/1416388,"“I absolutely love this strain. It's defiantly not GSC! If you are looking for hybrid that's Indica leaning, Sunset Sherbet is a fantastic choice. Perhaps a good alternative to Blue Dream. Great for anxiety, stress and pain. This can be a night time strain but for me I like it mid day or on a bad pain day perfect wake and bake but you might want a sativa chaser on stand by.
Dope strain !!!”"

Sherbet is in the GSC family, however  has a knock out power.

I had tried some Gabriel Sherbet and liked it, so I figured it would be good. It's similar, but not as orange creamy smelling, and not nearly as potent as I had hoped. It's very good weed, but Gabriel is just better. But really, I'm being super picky. It's very tasty, with notes of orange and herbs.”"
