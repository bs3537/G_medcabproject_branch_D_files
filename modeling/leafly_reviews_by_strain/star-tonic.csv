GoldCoastGrower,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/star-tonic/reviews/1415472,"“This strain is outstanding! Pain relief without couchlock. Mildly psychoactive compared to many other top-shelf strains. You can count on 12-16% CBD and 8-10% THC, depending on pheno.”"
Nazgul420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/star-tonic/reviews/1415473,"“I love this strain. And yes, I did get stoned even though it is a CBD strain, and I loved it! Very nice relaxing stone and pain simply goes up in smoke. I hope this strain stays around here in Michigan”"

boss05,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/star-tonic/reviews/1719287,"“I have been using this strain for a year now for anxiety and depression. Most other strains I have tried have triggered severe panic attacks. star tonic is a life changer for me. After a few hits I feel instantly relived of pain, stress, and anxiety. It helps me stay focused and motivated yet cool as a cucumber. Like a hybrid of Xanax and Adderall. I was on 6 different prescription meds for blood pressure, anxiety, d...”"

I'll comment on how it hit my head hips and lips. My daily pains & awkwardness gave way to an inability to walk without adding dance elements followed by the singing out loud of that which ran through my head. It's a dance weed, clear & calming head effects. Anytime meds. My respect to the breeders, local grow...”"

TeamCapsCacheGirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/star-tonic/reviews/1473262,"“Was surprised by how much i, and a couple of my regulars, liked Star Tonic! It has this smell like fresh cut lemons and pine needles, with the most faint wild-flowery undertones. The taste was like sweet lemons.
Everyone felt very loose and light. To me, this is the most narcotic - like high I've felt. Helped my back pain from a failed back surgery for about 2 hours.”"
NIKKIB713,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/star-tonic/reviews/1719795,"“A recent favorite this has become. Gives a nice easy, uplifting buzz without the paranoid effect some strains cause.  Smoking mixed with Citrique gave the best mellow uplifting buzz I've ever had. Has good flavor and is good anytime.”"
bigfinnkitchens,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/star-tonic/reviews/1334328,"“Very high citrus taste, made shatter from it and it tasted like popping a lemonhead in your mouth, the high cbd works excellent for calming my peripheral neuropathy did notice that if you  smoke strong indica before the startonic that it kills the buzz rather quickly which shows that it's very high in cbd's!!! This is my go to when my feet are driving me to the edge”"

DougNunn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/star-tonic/reviews/1429786,"“Great strain! Gives you the mild feeling of an indica, but takes away pain also. Awesome bud for active people or patients who want to medicate in the morning before taking on their day.”"

nicole010,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/star-tonic/reviews/1260063,"“Tried this strain last night. It gives off a nice lemon scent. It was more on the fluffy side as far as texture. It was more of a mellow high. I really didn't feel much of a difference in mood until I finished the joint. Not as strong as I would like. Would
 recommend for lighter smokers. A heavy stoner would probably need more to feel anything.”"

ogneutralize,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/star-tonic/reviews/1374546,"“Mediocre strain. Personally not a big fan of strains with more CBD than THC in them, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. The stuff I got was really dry and crumbly, and it gave me a moderate buzz. Overally, I'd toke it if I was offered it, but not something I'd go out of my way to find and buy.”"
