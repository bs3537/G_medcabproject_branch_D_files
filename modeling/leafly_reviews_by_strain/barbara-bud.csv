Sadly, there is no     "Clickity-Click.. BARBARA Trick!"     Here at all!!

I had SUCH high hopes for this one!!  But I was left rather disappointed.  I was hoping for the pain relief this was reported to be relatively famous for but......  

Again, just like in my review for WHITE WIDOW, if I could give 1/2 a star I would have given this one 2 1/2 Stars.  Now that being said, let me go over the pros AND co...”"

I ground it using a coffee grinder and put it into two cups.of simmering olive/vegetable oil that had a 23% fat content and got 4 batches of brownies out of it. Admittedly I overdosed the first time (as I used streetbud the last time, and only cut it with scissors and t...”"

Aladrieth,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1150627,"“THC 13.3%, CBD 0; $8/g from Tilray

This was the third strain I've tried so far. It was very different from Rene Mist and Jack Herer, and I much preferred it. The negatives aren't as bad, and the high is much more enjoyable for me.

It took awhile to actually get my order. I had to wait 'til after the weekend for it to be shipped, then the carrier messed up and delayed it another day. The packaging was a bit excessiv...”"

oldmanfang,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1389057,"“Not great but not bad. Its normally cheap so I grab as a afternoon sitting stuff.  So if you find it cheap its good for a backup not main supply.”"
BrownieGalInWpg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1138719,"“Have been taking it in smaller doses with the brownies cooked with the 5g/500ml oil, and although it does put my body into a bit of a bodylock state for 2-3 hours, it works well at keeping my concussion injuries at bay. Still experiencing some pain but as I would rather be able to still function this works for me.”"
erayfielf,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1243532,"“smokes fairly smoothly, thanks very well probably that's the best way to take it unless you choose to use it for cooking. using mainly for stress I wouldn't say it's the best out there  probably better this middle of the road”"
heitorhects,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1596256,"“This weed is very good use when you’re stressed or can’t sleep. It relaxes you so much, it’s ideal for night use, not a good idea smoking it before going to a party. 

Warning: Some people may feel dizzy.”"
kjohanna,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1506255,"“I suffer from anxiety, but I have never felt anxious smoking Barbara so I was surprised to see the negatives on here. I feel rather happy and relaxed, and I sleep like a baby. This is definitely my go-to when I want to relax.”"

2BallKane,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1373483,"“This review is for the indica dominant strain affectionately named “Barbra Bud”.

The strain that I have comes from my favorite producer Broken Coast, located in British Columbia Canada and punches in with a respectable 19.2 % THC.  This strain is 90% Indica.

When I opened the sealed bottle I was a little disappointed at the lack of smell from the buds.  Barbra only has a light spicy, woodsy smell and I prefer my bu...”"
feebie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1135785,"“It was very good in giving me a very deep relaxing feeling and I really enjoyed it at first. But I noticed after the 3rd or 4th time of having it, it really raised my anxiety levels. I have an anxiety disorder and it has been under control until I started using Barbara Bud. I have been super on edge and panicky for the past week, even after stopping use of it. Since I stopped taking it things have been calming down f...”"

ryman116,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1169284,"“Smoked it a few times now.  Gives me a mild body stone and no cerebral effect. Good for tense muscles without feeling out of it.”"

Ankush22,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1285833,"“A strong heavy indica that is both flavourful and powerful. Barbara bud has a unique sweet taste to it.”"
phaty,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1440101,"“Picked up on a local island shop. Was stoked to get my hands on it after hearing about it. Bland boring bud .. not very good. Not sure why anyone would be so stoked for this. Maybe a different grower would do better . Dispensaries need to stop stocking sub meds like this.”"
KrazyK420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1388325,"“Not a bad Indica, if your a new smoker or just looking for something light.. I enjoy this strain once in a while, but it's not for me as I enjoy the psychoactive effects too much to stick to a strain like Barbara Bud.”"

VonLex,https://www.leafly.com/indica/barbara-bud/reviews/1274301,"“I purchased this strain to help with my anxiety and sleepless nights.  I like to vape all of my strains and the body buzz off Barb gives me is really relaxing with absolutely no couch lock.  Took my dog for a walk after medicating and it felt like I was floating on a cloud the whole time.  Excellent strain and will definitely snag again.  Perfect amount of THC as well since I have a high sensitivity to it.”"
