Took a hit as soon as I got home and the grogginess and discomfort I had from a long walk home cleared up almost instantly. This is a sweet smelling bud smells infinitely better once busted (I stopped to "smell the roses" because it's so pretty). It's delicate scent paired with a mild smoke makes i...”"

Not very good for hanging out,  as all the jokes are suddenly unfunny,  but this would be good for some yoga,  art, or other personal relaxing experience”"

In spite of the fact that Leafly's Strain Highlights recommends it for evening use, I wouldn't say that this strain slowed me down too much.  To the contrary, I'd say that it gave me a certain lift. 

"Highly" recommended.”"

interstellarinsanity,https://www.leafly.com/indica/love-potion-9/reviews/1378708,"“it was a pretty nice bud, to be honest. it got me decently stoned, and really did help calm my back down. (I have 2 vertebrae out of place) 
I can really appreciate the flavour and smell of this bud, as they are both quite citrusy and smooth. 
bong rips are a piece of cake with this strain, and it's quite relaxing and calming.”"
DeanOG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/love-potion-9/reviews/1267003,"“The flower I sampled was very smooth and tasty - no harshness whatsoever.  It's effects were noticeable quickly with a nice warm and relaxed buzz that kept me creatively engaged in what I was doing and it didn't put me to sleep.”"

This strain is amazing, It took away all my stress after one bowl. I then walked inside after smoking that one bowl and realized that the power went out. So I entertained myself for an hour and a half waiting for the power to come back on. I even did some productive activities for a few minutes. One example is that I folded my laundry and put it aw...”"

This is a dispensary in the business for the right reasons. The buds were always perfect looking, with a nice frosting of crystals. It did a wonderful job of setting me in for couch lock and I was ready for bed within 1 hour of smoking and vaporizing this wonderful flower. It is better for insomnia than with pain, but still does a good j...”"

Nice even bodied Indica used during the day.
Had couple of year's ago rare treat to find.”"
waxjedi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/love-potion-9/reviews/1257264,"“Love Potion #9 is very nice strain overall. It's very sweet off the first pull, with a strong taste of cherry and overripe fruits finishing with an earthy-honey exhale. It has a nice relaxed body high without any really strong heady effects. That makes it a great strain for socializing as it does promote laughter and talking amongst friends, but I also found the duration of the high short, as did the relatively infre...”"

Smells like raspberry jam and fresh fish, and has a definite sweet raspberry cough. The sweet taste when I cough is possibly the best part of the strain I had. Nice purple colouring throughout that looks beautiful even when ground up.”"
