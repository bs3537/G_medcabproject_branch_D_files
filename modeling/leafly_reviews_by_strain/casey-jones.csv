This is one of the best strains I've ever used if you want to connect to that part of your mind that is open to new ideas, feelings, and truths. You know how sometimes when you're medicated, you just get those pure, awesome thoughts that your busy brain (working, parenting, relationships, etc) just d...”"

I believe any cannabis enthusiast would strongly enjoy what I just smoked. I suffer from depression. Within minutes, I feel elated and motivated to get things done... I washed the dishes which have been sitting for over a day. More specifically: Mild eye redness. Medium dry mouth. I feel awake, comparable to mult...”"

I've been stress free and chillaxed for Four hours so far. I also like to play video games and go outdoors. I will buy a 1/4 next time haha.”"
MJsMedShop,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/casey-jones/reviews/1398574,"“In my opinion Casey Jones acts just like a Sativa with a very short high followed by a burst of energy and a happy go lucky attitude. This strain reminds me of exactly the kind of medicine the Hippies used to smoke in the 70's. The only issue I have with that is I want more stone before the the Sativa takes effect. (The C.J. upfront stone only lasted 30 mins. followed by an additional hour or so of background high.)...”"
