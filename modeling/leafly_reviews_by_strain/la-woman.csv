The smell that comes from them when you break it up is a lemony smell. When you hit it, it doesn't have a very strong taste like the smell. The effects start in about 2 minutes after smoking. It's a fairly smooth smoke. You begin to feel spaced out and relaxed. Your eyes feel relived of pressure as well. After an hour, you begin to feel like your coming down...”"
