crinoid1919,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrix/reviews/1416419,"“Citrix extract by Open Vape is a wonderful product. It has a fantastic flavor... like grapefruit meets a pineapple. The high can't be beat, leaving you focused and energized.”"
DeviBliss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrix/reviews/1416422,"“This was nice, but a bit underwhelming. I felt relaxed and aware, but not particularly driven - this was a nice middle-ground. It also allowed me to really enjoy my food, leisurely savoring it, and might do well for others with or in recovery from eating disorders.”"

cannabisnihang,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrix/reviews/1341195,"“The pheno of this I've tried is slightly different than the more popular/common one. This pheno leans heavily to the grapefruit lineage with its very strong citrus, slightly fuely scent. The high is a good middle ground between la confidential and grapefruit with its quick onset back of the head creep, phenomenally mellow body high, and great energy with definitely euphoric feelings. This is a must in your stash if y...”"

Very tasty citrus taste. Very potent shatter. I took 3 dabs and I am completely stoned. My head is feeling heavy, my eyes are feeling heavy but I am completely alert and awake.

The color is darker amber honey. It is shatter, and does shatter... haha

LeroyBrown420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrix/reviews/1281670,"“It's all about the Limonene. I've noticed that citrus flavored cannabis put's me in a great mood, kicking stress & anxiety to the curb. This Sativa dominate jewel is kind of speedy and the scent is best described as, "skunky citrus with a fruity pungency much like rotting fruit". The effects are uplifting energetic very social in nature.  A great afternoon pick-me-up or smoked in lieu of a cup of coffee.”"

Purchased shatter and Live resin concentrates of this strain yesterday from a local Denver med dispensary. This is my first time trying Citrix in any form.

Standard flower time is around 9-10 weeks but this phenotype was more like 11. It was a great strain to grow, it wasn't finicky, grew very quickly and had great side branching.
This plant yielded very heavy! loved it, would recommend it to just about anybody, it would be great for a beginner or a commercial cropper. I give it a 9/10 on the grow side!

A little goes a long way!”"
rainsunshine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrix/reviews/1574041,"“Super energizing. Creative. My dispensary called it "the espresso of cannabis." Not at all lethargic or dreamy, but still thoughtful. Counteracts tiredness.”"

Buds are sticky and dense, releasing aromas of mellow sweet citrus, key lime, and pastries.  Immediately after smoking my muscles relax and I'm greeted with a pleasant head buzz.  I'm relaxed and calm, but gave me just a little boost of energy and I'm happy to tackle my tasks for the day.”"
