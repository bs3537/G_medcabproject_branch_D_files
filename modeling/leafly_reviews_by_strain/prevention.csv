This is my favorite strain. I’ve been getting it from a dispensary in norther California for years. It’s a very nice pure indica! Very calming with a nice body high, yet still uplifting enough for creativity! Nice tight, bright green and magenta nugs covered in crystals! Smell is floral and earthy. Love this norther California strain!”"
