White Lavender
=============
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lavender/reviews/1409980,"“Gently nudges you out of a bad mood.  You'll be smiling and laughing...a lot.  Sativa dominant for sure.  Probably best as a morning strain, although I tried it for the first time at 6:00 pm.  It's going to be a late night.....of fun.  This would be a nice strain for your friends who are not so experienced with weed.  No paranoia, just happiness and laughter....and very wide open eyes.”"
leverage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lavender/reviews/1394146,"“This strain definitely has anti-inflammatory qualities. I have a herniated disc L5S1 and white lavender really helped ease my pain consistently. 

It smells amazing (the lavender smell is apparent), and the high is relaxing and mellow. Would recommend to anybody with back pain issues.”"
Feels64,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lavender/reviews/1413942,"“I bought this from my local dispensary, Cannaroli station by Soap Lake, Washington.
This review has a bit to do with personal preference. I like basically anything to do with marijuana, so I'm not terribly picky 
about my weed. I do know the difference between good bud and great bud though. This is an in depth review of White Lavender from W.O.W! Weed.

The High: 
Rather weak high. Very mellow, good body rush. Takes ...”"
NMHiker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lavender/reviews/1417166,"“Absolutely mind blowing high. Happy, euphoric and what it does for my pain, oh wow. Very pretty, dense, buds with a little cedar smell. Having a downer day and got pain try this. Go easy with it it is potent.”"
mjuil,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lavender/reviews/1413943,"“Buds were fluffy and covered in tricomes. The smell is excellent, soothing even. Smoke and vapor are both hardly noticeable while inhaling and it's easy to ingest more than you might with a more diesely or skunky strain. The high is a beautiful blend of relaxed euphoria and mental stimulation. There wasn't much I was able to do other than be engulfed in my own thoughts. At one point on White Lavender my friend turned...”"
voice918,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lavender/reviews/1417169,"“Indica on the body,
Sativa on the brain.
A++ for this hybrid strain!

This particular batch wasn't visually beautiful (small buds, some stems- meh color), but the look on the bud-tender's face when I asked her if she'd tried it, said it all.

The high is right!

If I smoke too much, it wears me out from over-stimulation. 
That's how it went from being the perfect daytime weed, to the perfect nighttime weed. 

Also- b...”"

nbarefoot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lavender/reviews/1264821,"“Extremely cerebral. Could be a bit mentally exhausting if smoked throughout the whole day. Almost electric. Not good for anxiety, in fact it gave me a bit of a panic attack but  it's very good for a midday smoke if you aren't stressed.”"
shastameds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lavender/reviews/1200480,"“Got some from my collective in Mount Shasta and am loving it more and more everytime I smoke it (and I LOVED it to start with)!  Amazing spicy lavender smells and tastes and puts me in a really relaxed mood, body and mind:)”"
riotslug,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lavender/reviews/1518498,"“Am amazing calming social strain that removes that tightness that is the fear of socializing and, for me, catastrophizing thoughts that lead to anxiety. You'll have a great time, and while it's not the best for pain, it's strong enough to make it an effective pain killer for a solid 10-15 minutes depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke at once. It helped me socialize and I had considerably less inhibitions...”"
SilentPatient,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lavender/reviews/1417170,"“Tasty. Lime green with orange hairs. More of a sativa effect, however, after about 20 minutes or so, the indica effect lingered around and made itself known. The batch I'm reviewing was considered bottom shelf, and fairly priced considering that the buds were nicer looking than their top shelf selections.”"

Definitely sativa dominant but not to the point of paranoia which is something I’ve struggled with when smoking sativas. Nice light body high that had all my muscles relaxed and left me feeling like I was floating on a cloud. I’ve read other reviews saying this is good for daytime but I think I’ll stick to smoking it at night. Makes...”"
