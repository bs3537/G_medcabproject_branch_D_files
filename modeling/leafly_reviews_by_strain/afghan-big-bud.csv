Afghan Big Bud
=============
heartbraden,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-big-bud/reviews/1272927,"“Afghan Kush and Big Bud were crossbred to create this strain, and it was worth it.  It retains the shape of Big Bud (each bud is incredibly dense at about 2-3 grams apiece), but it keeps the taste of the Afghan.  For me, it comes on relatively quickly, but doesn't stay for more than an hour and a half, during which my mood was quite incredibly turned around, and I was, for lack of better words, just in a happy mood. ...”"

But the effects it would give you were great, Smoke a bong or two and chill infront of the PC playing Video games, it was very intence! you would really get into the moment. and feel it as if you were really there. found myself being rather suprised i was in reality after the effects came off. so hitting a few bongs mo...”"

cyprushits,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-big-bud/reviews/1060464,"“This bud looks and smells so fresh that the high practically kicks in right then and there. As far as smoking, it went down smooth as hell out of a glass bong. The high was mostly lazy and euphoric; I didn't feel like socializing, as focusing on the high was the most pleasurable thing to do. Although the initial high wears off after about an hour, from 1 hour to 5 hours later it leaves you feeling tired, lazy, and ou...”"

KushGypsy420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-big-bud/reviews/1305399,"“I love that the taste isn't over powering. Drinking coffee with to keep my energy up. An intermediate smokers strain. Euphoria but tingly and I got stuck in my head quite a bit”"

Cfabela1216,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-big-bud/reviews/1305328,"“Tastes amazing, really smooth. The high comes on quick and I've had a permanent grin from first inhalation:) most people would probably like this in the evening or for a lazy day as its kinda heavy feeling. Definitely 5 stars and this gem will be added to my list for faves.”"
CelticCracker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-big-bud/reviews/1329104,"“I smoked this as a pre-roll.  Very heavy head high, no traveling thoughts. Heavy body relaxation and drowsiness. Slept very soundly at night. I did get a slight case of munchies. As it was a pre-roll, I have no visual or aromatic description. I do plan on buying flower in the near future, I will update at that time.”"
spacetees,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-big-bud/reviews/1453973,"“Great experience with this strain. Has a very interesting, almost fruity scent and the bud is dense and sticky. Definitely a nighttime strain, smacks you in the face and all you want to do after this strain wears off is sleep. I would recommend if looking for a euphoric, couch lock high”"

astern324,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-big-bud/reviews/1390265,"“AK47 is not really my ideal strain.  Though a hybrid, it definitely tends towards the indica side.  I like the lucidity of the high--however, unlike some boutique indicas, AK47 totally tires me out.  After about 1 hour (10:00pm) I was ready to hit the hay.

Also:  not the prettiest weed.  Though very dense, AK47 not virtually no frosting and the smoke is like bleach in your throat.”"
