grassnation,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-diesel-kush/reviews/1379561,"“I have been looking for a quality hybrid strain that makes me feel both uplifted/euphoric and, at the same time, provides a nice, relaxing body high.

Recently I smoked an OG Diesel joint and quickly discovered that this was the strain I have been searching for. Even after just a few hits, I was feeling the effects throughout my body and mind.

This strain makes me want to explore and enjoy life, instead of being loc...”"
Woodvtech,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-diesel-kush/reviews/1379562,"“Instant pain relief with one hit. (I am a 40 year daily toker). Body incredibly relaxed.  Instant head high that settled into a super afternoon of brain activity both creative and business. Body just enjoyed being pain free and totally relaxed. Not one for physical activity other than a nice walk. 
This is a strain best suited for the medicine chest. Not only was my everyday pain raging but I also was getting over a ...”"

OGD helps tremendously w/pain & anxiety gives me an energy lift  & my mood improves instantly! Vaping is best but I'll go old school too & roll up - either way the flavors are intoxicating 💞One thing's for sure -  OG diesel has me grinning my way through the day & able to do the things I used to do without pain!  😁 if you get the chance give it a try & enjoy 😎✌🏻️”"
Mikee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-diesel-kush/reviews/1343285,"“Really excellent blend! my dispensary has this under the name Big Kush..really great taste; sweet and light but not really flowery or citrusy..smoke a lot quickly and you'll start to get light visual effects..relaxed euphoric body buzz but not super lazy/muddy..it's an all-around good solid bud”"

But in the midst of some huge life changes, I found myself paralyzed with fear. Anxiety from the time I wake up until the time I go to bed,  and even with vaping several different strains for the last couple of days, I got no real lasting relief. Until now. Desperate for something to calm my nerves, I opened up a cartridge of CO2 oil...”"

konan2113,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-diesel-kush/reviews/1373142,"“Great candy/fuely/ skunky smell. First couple hits were very tasty and had me almost spinning. Then it relaxed into a nice strong mellow high. My buddy that moved awhile back to oregon called me and i was able to hold a convo easily and enjoyably. Very good for my back pain as well. I really enjoy that taste from the bubbler. Bout to vape and see how that goes. Def getting this again!”"
Byros,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-diesel-kush/reviews/1360768,"“For me, a heavy user, this strain fits into my morning usage.  What I had was a very energetic and clear headed high.  The pain relief, however was off the chart.  After only a half bowl, it felt like I had just rubbed my neck and shoulders with Ben Gay or something. (xep smell mo betah).  Amazing.  Only felt this much pain relief before after some really good Chem Dawg.  This is even better.  Leafly rightly ranks th...”"
sgordon31,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-diesel-kush/reviews/1254425,"“The miggity-mellowist high I've ever had the easier if experiencing. Comes on fast but gentle. Very content, peaceful. The high feels a little like melting away or like floating gently in the healing hot springs of Iceland. Very heady but not to be surpassed by the awesome - jaw sagging and knuckle dragging body high.

I HIGHly recommend this. If you get your hands on it, cherish it.”"
MadLawliet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-diesel-kush/reviews/1067128,"“Really good effects! I was smoking in the park and when I finished I felt that I had to get up and start walking beacause I was full of energy! I felt really happy and creative so I called a friend and we talked for about an hour while I was looking some children playing football.
Same night I went to the birthday of a friend and we smoked it.
Everyone was happy and we enjoyed it a lot listening music and talking.

This hybrid left me holding onto the bench in a park think the world was falling like as if I was the guy on the back end of the Titanic going into the ocean. Major HD vision effect like wallpaper in the background, paranoia like no other, and left me laughing my ass off. Highly recommend this strain.”"

onlyneed1guitar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-diesel-kush/reviews/1067127,"“Very strong strain. Tastes like straight diesel fuel and smells like skunk. However, it takes very little to get you high. I would highly recommend this strain for when you are alone. It makes you fall asleep on the couch or get lost in thought too easily. Never have yet had a bad experience on it though. One of my all time favorites.”"
