libertygrower,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mandarin-sunset/reviews/1781620,"“This strain has the most mandarin orange taste and smoke I’ve ever experienced. My wife even noticed the orange citrus smell from the exhale. Very sedative effects but I generally just smoke for the flavours. I haven’t experienced tangie yet but so far this is my #1 for orange terps.”"
