Smell/Taste: The smell and taste a fairly light,but sweet fruity and pungent at the same time,very smooth. Nothing you will complain about
Effects: The looks draw you in, but the effec...”"

It's an excellent sativa for people with anxiety, especially social anxiety. It makes you relaxed, easygoing and chatty, but also energetic, very happy with a soothing buzz. 

I suffer from severe OCD and anxiety with IBS and find that sativa or dominant hybrids work best for me as they stop my anxiety, give me huge relief from the...”"
hababadagada,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/atomical-haze/reviews/1370532,"“Has a fruity/minty flavour at the beginning if vaped, changing to a nutty flavour at the end. Munchies the whole duration. It gets me started off feeling a bit lightheaded and quite sativa-esque with a lot of inspiration, creativity, and clear thinking. The comedown feels relaxed, tired, and hungry. Definitely a preferred sativa-dominant strain.”"

jangaroo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/atomical-haze/reviews/1346653,"“I liked this strain a lot. 
Made everything sort of dizzy but in a good way. 

Breaks apart and grinds nicely the smoke from this always sort of harsh but totally worth it. 

Would definitely order more.”"

Time to put on some tunes and get to work!”"

The craziest thing about the plants that my friend grew out, is that the main kola on one of the them was MASSIVE, the size of a peewee league football. As beautiful as it was, I pushed my buddy to remove the kola a little early because I was co...”"
