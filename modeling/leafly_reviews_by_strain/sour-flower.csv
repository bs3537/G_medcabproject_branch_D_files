Perfect to indulge in late morning/ early afternoon.  You'll feel super efficient, organized.....and very very high. This strain has made it to my top 5.”"
pinkbatprincess,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1411749,"“This strain makes everything positively *scrumptious*. Food, art, the feel of the breeze on one's skin all become beautiful, erotic, singularly glorious. This strain is for indulging your senses with. Bon appétit!”"

swerv512,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1353846,"“First timer with this strain and it has become one of my favorite 24hr smokes. It has one of the skunkiest aromas I've smelled lately, and it smoked with a piney aftertaste. The effects kick in rather quickly and crescendo smooth and continuously to a very crafty high that can be used for pain relief and sofa relaxation or a round of spring cleaning or afternoon hike. Very mellow, non-anxious high.”"

Kosherkid,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1353845,"“Midgrade that acts like a top shelf; honestly surprised its cheaper than other strains. Very smooth and rips hard. The effects are much more focused and energetic than your average sativa. Distracted me from hunger, not sure if that's just me though. I want more of this stuff.”"
Shmoogalooga,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1119442,"“Sour flour has these amazingly dense crystallized nugs that sparkle beautifully in the light and grind into a fine powder with ease. Nice light frosty green and wonderful aroma that has notes of citrus, tropical fruit, and spice. Best of all it has that classic sativa high that leaves you clear headed and energized. It is tops for me as a wake and bake strain and it helps my attention deficited self stay functional a...”"

surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1353847,"“pian relief yes! 
anxiety relief not so much!  
actually stimulated me to the maxx rendering me tweeked out and extremely anxious as a result of aimless hours of jumping from one project to another. felt caffeined out. but pain ? pain apparently missed the train!  great earthy sweet punch when exhaling, smooth, yummy mango hints mixed with a background of  chemical twist when inhaling ☆☆☆☆ ~ ♡♡♡♡”"

The smell of the bud was average. The look of the bud was lumpy and poorly trimmed. 

I didn't get any sour or tropical flavors from this one.

The high was ok. I didn't get sleepy. It did lift my mood a bit. one thing I liked, I always got a noticeable body buzz soon after smoking it. Almost like indica, but no couc...”"

surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1313348,"“considering its mild effects I would have to rate this as middle of the road medicine. it did however provide an energy to my body which is consistent with the sativa lineage.”"

ryno144z,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1165918,"“Really good sativa...nice for the morning or being outside...Earthy and piney on the inhale and sweet on the exhale... Nugs are nice a dense and I'm not sure if it's true but heard it's super silver haze double crossed”"
3005junkie,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1643906,"“Earthy sativa that is a rather spacey and relaxed high. For me, not necessarily focused or motivated , but rather more content and relaxed. High is a late hitter and rather strong. Never have been overwhelmed from it though.”"
jetco,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1697243,"“Haven't smoked any for a while but when the dispensary has it I never pass it up.  Makes me feel happy relaxed and creative.  Definitely one of my top ten strains”"
tblank_75,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1673367,"“one of the best day burn strains there is.  Smooth smoke, uplifted very nice high, but focused, and energetic.  I'm also a big fan of super silver haze(the sativa pheno with the sativa buds) but this one is less stony, more focused and energetic.  Now to be sure I'm comparing with the sativa pheno of super silver haze, not the indica super silver haze pheno with the northern light buds and indica effects.  And unlike...”"

waygood,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1119447,"“Super buds, green and bubbly. A bit of a spicy smoke, but I can feel the effects immediately in the center of the forehead. Makes me feel a bit anxious though... definitely an afternoon smoke.”"
jayyyyneeeee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-flower/reviews/1498295,"“wow thanks to this 1/8th I'm trying out I feel awesome. The smell is earthy chemical cantaloupe not even kidding, you can tell it's a strain quite distinct from its predecessor super silver haze which is much much more of a racy hold on to your socks kind of intense high. This strain has got a lot of upside and glad I got to give it a whurl in my perc bong 12''”"
