=============
CCSB,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1362453,"“Love this strain! I put about 2g of pure kief into some cream cheese and ate about 2-3tbsp on some crackers. To my surprise, once the high came on I became incredibly turned on! I've been on anti-depressants for a few months now and have had an extremely low sex drive, so for me finding out that I react this way to Sweet Tooth has been a God-send and probably just saved my relationship. I would recommend this strain ...”"
Connorjl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1225342,"“The aloha berry is full of all colors has a very pungent smell and very rich sweet full taste and has a hell of a high I assume it is a hybrid because of the color and the intensity of the high is all encompassing body and mind very relaxing and euphoric I would go as far to say that it's a trippy strain. But with a much better indica balance then LSD Kush.”"
SassySueAnne,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1352433,"“recently moved to the Seattle Area and found this in a dispensary.  I have Bipolar Disorder and it really helped me with Focus and Anger issues.  The taste is sweet but shows up after you exhale.  Did cause the munchies but helped with Nausea”"
GINskrilla,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1163215,"“MUNCHIES!  The high alone is extremely dream like and pleasant.  This is a sativa dominant with somewhat of a down.  It gives you a feeling of extreme creativity.  The high will hit in waves of drowsy/lazy and motivated.”"
kot_carson,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1061358,"“I wish that "Better" was a choice for the effects it has.  I have a chronic nausea syndrom and this strain has helped more than anything else I've ever tried.  If you suffer from nausea and just want to feel better, I recommend this one!”"

It wasn't really a particularly great strain. It made me really tired which was good for night time, but in the day it just makes me wanna sleep instead of enjoying the high which is alright if you smoke a lot of it. I give it a 7”"

Rijahsohigh420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1656219,"“I feel so relaxed and expressive with this strain. I’m loving how is taste and the high so freaking dope. I never believed in taking pills as a treatment for depression so I really love the fact that can smoke something from the earth I feel it’s a much healthier approach. I highly recommend this strain to anyone”"
parismichael,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1061349,"“Very sweet and smooth. Great if you have insomnia.”"

petethekoala,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1298581,"“If this strain don't make the top 10 of my most loved strains, it definitely make the top 25 or top 10 Indica easily. This weed is awesome, fruity and honey, sweetness coming probably from some enigmatic Kush origin. I could smoke this everyday for a while. Makes you relax after a day of hard labour. Perfect for a chill RPG video games night or to go to bed!”"

RogerGoodEl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1551975,"“had this about a month ago.. im reviewing it because looking on the app, crossing this with my all time favorite, mendo purps, makes up purple candy- but this honestly was a top three looking strain. the thc content must havr been pushing 30, dripping with trichomes and a sedative high. loved it”"
karmacollectiveca,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1170963,"“Grew from seeds. Awesome strain. I have a stomach disorder which causes nausea and this worked great so far. Definitely relaxing. Great for anxiety and insomnia as well.”"
KingRed7,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1308059,"“One word that comes to mind when I take a bowl of this strain is "sleep". It's an herb I want to role up or pack a bowl with before watching a movie on Netflix or some shit so I can just melt into the couch and be blaow afff.”"
Tirnanignog,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bc-sweet-tooth/reviews/1295790,"“Think of this as that guilty dessert you love.  The taste sets this top shelf strain apart from others.  The only strain I have tried that matches this honey sweet strain is LVPK.  Not the most potent (ala Kong, Tora Bora) around but that is not a bad thing.  The incredible flavor makes you keep,wanting more.”"
