Took a couple fat dabs of this in shatter. Super tasty and the high is energetic , yet calm at the same time. I definitely feel the uplift and a lil giggly. Which is dope. Laughing is great my dawg.

PowRider,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/raskal-og/reviews/1414980,"“Picked this up from CAM after a recommendation from my bud tender. Vaporized it has a grassy and musty taste. The smell is a piney lemon scent. This bud was absolutely caked in trichomes and was sticky to the touch. The buzz was relaxing with a nice body effect that would be exceptional for pain. It lasted around 2 hours and left me wanting more! Definitely check this strain out if pain management is what you seek.”"

I am prone to paranoia and anxiety, so in order to receive the medicinal benefits of THC I need a lot of CBD to keep me 100% functional and Raskal OG is perfect when I want to just roll a joint and greedily smoke the whole thing:)

The strain is always the most expensive at my local shop and I tried some during a smoke session recently. The first few hits gives you a buzz. Not a full blown head high or head change, but just a slight body and head buzz. Other than the fast head buzz, I didn't feel euphoric, I didn't feel anything out of the ordinary from my usual feelings.

One thing I was aware of was how Raska...”"

csquared,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/raskal-og/reviews/1414979,"“Did not really like this strain. I believe that this is more for everyday use, what I mean by that is that from this strain, you dont feel high, all pain is relieved, but that sense of feeling high is not there, so if you are looking to be a "normal" high, pick up this strain, but if you want to feel like your floating on a cloud or looking for a GOOD time, do not get this strain”"

Needed something to relax my body and this sure did! The vape was so smooth, sweet and piney. Only microdosed a few pulls, but did exactly what I needed.
