Martian Mean
=============
Slothrop,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1230158,"“Mean Green starts out quite potent, with a high powered sativa hit that lasts a bit over an hour, then gently fades over the next 40 minutes. There's something like a hint of grapefruit and sugary vanilla in the smell, and upon vaping the taste is an odd, musty, yet creamy cheese. Very unusual and worth trying for that reason alone. The high left something to be desired - mainly, I was wishing the indica characterist...”"

amasseur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1063851,"“After a month of smoking this I am revising my overall rating.  I added an extra point because there still seems to be no tolerance building up.  This is a very reliable strain if you need a high level of reliability and consistency with your medication.”"
batterytimes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1272669,"“This stuff is the most perfect savita/dominant strain i've ever encountered, just for everyday use to alleviate constant anxiety/stress/depression symptoms. makes you feel focused, spacey, and tingly for a very very long time. I get 3 or 4 hours out of a fairly small bowl in the pipe. try it at any cost”"
Joe_Grows10,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1199559,"“This strain if grown properly will leave you feeling like its the very first time you smoked. You will feel uplifted and laugh at almost everything however on the down the Strains Indica roots come out leaving you focused but slightly sedated.”"

chelseacutie6421,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1655537,"“I must say, this strain is pretty potent and dense. First, the high is very mellow and relaxing, and it helps me go to sleep. It also makes me hungry and increases my appetite, which is good for me because I have a bad appetite and am trying to gain weight. Sooo, I'd say this Mean Martian is the shit lol”"
amasseur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1063844,"“Even though I typically smoke every 3-4 hours I was pleasantly surprised by the strength of this strain.  I have gone through almost an oz. and I don't seem to be building up any tolerance.  I am color blind so most bud looks the same to me.  But there is something about this one that makes it seem different.  It seems to be completely white.”"
gurren_lynx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1063827,"“Great Sativa. Energizing and good for anxiety. Perfect for during the day. Very potent but doesn't last longer than 2 hours.”"

kyuuuu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1358864,"“It's good no doubt. The only problem is for me is that it can focus you but not for multitasking. So it's not exactly a daytime smoke when you have things to do but not enough indica for night.”"

snazzyjake,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1354792,"“I think this strain gives a good head high and has a sweet interesting smell and taste. Burns very nicely and smokes smoothly. Definitely a good strain for party's, movies, and music. Also a good strain after a long day and stressful events.”"

marijuanaformeditation,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1275328,"“Had about 5 epiphanies in 30 minutes, this strain brings my body to a relaxing state & my mind out of this world.

sungodv,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1228031,"“I am finding MMG to be sedating vaporized at higher temps and very mild at lower temps.  Not overly potent nor tested by dispensary, but strikes me as being higher in CBD and somewhat lower in THC.”"
Josh135,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1335768,"“Grew this outdoor this year. Beautiful dark colored plant with frosty colas. Very fragrant with hints of grapefruit and citrus. Euphoric and uplifting. Great for just hanging out and watching TV.”"

HigherthanCheshire,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-mean-green/reviews/1387656,"“I would say 4.5 for this strain. Very good strain, high potency on the sativa side and there are few but very strong indica effects with this strain that I experienced. Would say more or less a good sativa dominant strain with some subtle but strong indica effects. Also, it is a fantastic blunt strain, tastes great and is a fantastic smoke too. To the moon and back, HigherthanCheshire.”"
