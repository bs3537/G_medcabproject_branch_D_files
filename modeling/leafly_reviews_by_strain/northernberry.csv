And I'm so damn comfortable and cuddly. I was made for sleep. When I was a kid, I used to wonder what my stuffed animal was thinking about. And now I know. That dude was content. I mean, c'mon, he knew exactly how cuddlicious he was. Plus he was pretty cute. But he knew life wasn't so bad. Sure, some tragic stu...”"

OK sorry for caps but I'm serious, northern berry aka "Big Blue" is an amazing Indica with amazing Sativa cerebral effects to complement the heavy indica. This strain smells and reeks of Blueberry more than any other Blueberry strain I've tried I truly can't believe the taste off this stuff it's incredible. This stuff is amazing for pain relief, anxiety & depression, you will definitely get "glued...”"
HazeRage,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northernberry/reviews/1416546,"“First of all this strain is a Washington state bred native. It's a fine cross of Great white shark x northern lights x Dj shorts Blueberry, its a fairly new strain as of 2014. Upon first look this looks like some dank, big chunky frosty semi - dense nugs, minimal red hairs, maximum frostiness. The buds are top shelf quality, the grower has exceptional growing skills. So the bag appeal is great, now time to smoke... S...”"
LesTadO,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northernberry/reviews/1412075,"“I took a hit and held it...  As I blew it out my eyelids became heavy immediately.  Wonderful berry taste and awesome Indica high.  Very relaxing and tasty.  Definitely one of my favorites so far.”"

crazycolton55,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northernberry/reviews/1244392,"“This weed has a similar high to blue dream though the flavor is a bit more piney flavored but still very blueberry. Very nice looking buds that are similar to blue dream again but are darker. 4/5”"
Jellybean213,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northernberry/reviews/1586759,"“They told me this would be close to my favored Blackberry Kush and so I took it. Didn't even read the blurb or reviews... got in the back seat and took a drag on the 'smoky pen'. Once my friend started driving I started investigating and was reading the effects and saw Giggly which in turn made me bust out laughing and my friend and his wife start laughing. Getting stoned with the Godparents is neat! 

But seriously,...”"
Jaleely,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northernberry/reviews/1447673,"“I just tried this for the first time a day ago. I was looking for something that would help me relax, deal with pain, and fall asleep. This Indica has really delivered. I was able to find this beauty in Sumpter, Oregon. It's a very, very small town in the mountains, but has excellent service and this wonderful indica.”"
apexpyro,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northernberry/reviews/1210238,"“Gives a great body high, extremely euphoric happy buzz . Lots of laughs shared with this bud. Not many negatives, the bud doesn't smell too potent but don't let that fool you. Has purple "berry" spots in the herb, very electric strain overall”"

blueyedmule,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northernberry/reviews/1329533,"“Fifty year old weed virgin here to update my review. I have since widened my pallette and tried much stronger, more cerebral strains. NB cuts a gentle swath through the more mind-scrambling strains and offers a gentle path to rest and sleep. I find the effects evenly balanced between head and body with no overwhelming surprises for newbs like me. If you need a louder experience you will want a different strain. NB is...”"

Sabine_Schmit,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northernberry/reviews/1633396,"“Powerful indica - immediately mellows you out and relaxes body and mind (though body more for me). Didn't improve depression really for me but did ease my anxiety. Hunger creeps up on you, then bam - tired dry eyes ready to sleep, and a lil dizziness and slight headache too.

Her father passes on that signature blueberry aroma underscored by notes of earthy hash. Despite its heavy indica influence, Northern Berry delivers a complex balance of cerebral and body effects best suited for late afternoon or evening consumption. Novices, take caution: Northern Berry is intense experience for bo...”"

With an initial lifting effect like you're being escorted to a sexfestival by a gaggle of accumulous clouds, this baby takes you for a ride. A very soothing and relaxing body high with an outlook sure to put a smile on your face. But
Don't smoke too much, i rolled one blunt too many and ended up hunting down and killing a nearby animal, cooking it that night with a side of
Hotfries. Munchies s...”"

I had no problem knowing where to stop. Others I have overindulged on accident because they took a while to hit. I plan on growing this strain next season. This was an Applegate Valley Organics product--nicely done!”"

But since there's no separate article for that one yet I will leave a review here. This strong indica remotely reminded me of Mazar I had before. It's very euphoric and body relaxing. Very pleasant smell, however I expected more berries in it. It's sweet and pungent, still a little harsh when smoking, made me cough...”"
