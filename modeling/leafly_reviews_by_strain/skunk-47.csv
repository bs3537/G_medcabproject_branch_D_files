Smells pretty nice with a spicy and earthy smell. got mine from Orgrow and I got one 3.5g bud that had a decent trim job. It had a THC content of 23% and I think .3 cbd.”"

This is definitely one for the ladies as it is excellent for menstruaion nausea and cramps! 100% a menstrual smoke! And it increases your arousal tenfold!

The flowers smell awesome and I was excited to spark this bud. First off the taste wasn't as expected, nothing really notable or something I would call good but it was descent.
