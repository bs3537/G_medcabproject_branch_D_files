aandydaviss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1381686,"“This was my first hookup since moving out to California & I'm not too impressed. Smoked several bowls & acquired a decent high but only for a very short period of time. No long lasting affects for me at all. Not necessarily a bad strain, but definitely not the best. Also made me very uneasy / slightly paranoid after prolonged smoking.”"
burningthc,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1354404,"“I've been getting tired of getting hybrids that feel way too sativa dominant. This is a good balance of sativa and indica for me. Squishy buds, nice moisture, doesn't grind well though. Slighter darker color then normal, almost a forest green, and looks similar to a typically unappealing strain. I looked at it and I was like this looks like below average weed but it is the wonder weed for me. Good for everything. 5/5...”"

flyboy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1274173,"“Strong head sativa buzz with that gives you that hot-head around the eyes feeling that focuses the brain.  I'm not crazy about the taste though its decent - but I then again I don't seem to like sativa tastes compared to indica or hybrids. Sativa smoke feels somewhat prickly to my palate.  Definitely a repeat score for me, it does everything I want a sativa to do, and it does it well.”"

Dry aroma: very strong herbal (but pleasant), hints of candied citrus.  Definitely put me in a good mood & inspired me to put together a piece of ikea furniture.  Felt uplifted (had been feeling down the last few days) - though approaching the 1.5 hour mark (I was continually vaping the whole time) I started to feel a tad bit disoriented.  Probably now my favo...”"

I like to go all in for first time new strain session.  I used my vape with my bong attachment and 7-8 rips later I'm astro......flying....
Very tingly, really uplifting at first then comforts you with that warm, out of the dryer feeling, blanket of euphoria. Very clear headed. Green Hornet is a real be...”"
greymusic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1173736,"“Green Hornet was pitched to me as a high-creativity sativa that might help w/ my depression. While the few times I smoked it I did feel a bit happier/more elated, the 'creative' part never came, and the effects of the stuff I had weren't very strong. A nice strain either way, but not particularly wow-ing.”"

Poganman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1267913,"“A very nice and very potent Sativa Dominant Hybrid. Very convenient for day or night time use. Especially good for starting off the day with a bong rip!”"
AaronD,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1175746,"“Great strain for focusing on work, reading, or gaming. The only con is that it made me kind of tense and paranoid.”"
NewMoney781,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1232812,"“First time I got this strain, I enjoy it,and my patients also.  DEFFINATLY not a downer high for me, DEFFINATLY had a lot of laughs! If it came around again I would get it”"

brandon22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1141757,"“Picked up from a local dispensary for $15 1/8th.
The flowers are nice and dense with some big buds. I love the smell, reminds me of a strain called jilly bean. Nice calm high, that doesn't make you tired and gets your mind right.”"
thecolorofyourenergy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1643302,"“I’ve been smoking this specific strain for a good 2 weeks now because I bought a pretty big supply of it at once figuring it’d be nice to have something I haven’t smoked before, and I was honestly disappointed. I felt like my highs were very short & not at all creative. Times I were sober between smoking green hornet I felt very boring & sad, which took me a little bit to realize it was because of what I was smoking....”"
ajemaner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1381687,"“didn't have the sting I was looking for. definitely didn't score high on the paranoia scale as rated. very cool looking buds though.”"
weeedConnoisseur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1209392,"“Gets you really high; the high is a very happy and euphoric one with a very distant feeling. All in all a very nice strain.”"

Though it did make me want to ignore everyone and finish all the projects in the house.”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1505068,"“As some other reviews have noted, Green Hornet works like magic on headaches. I had a nasty sinus headache and it  just wiped it out . GH is powerful without a doubt and euphoric as possible. A happy head will be had.”"
mjaremyactualinitials,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1573398,"“Via edible. Strong head high.  It’s good for body relaxation but your mind stays active and becomes more creative and critical. Feeling a little extra emotionally sensitive and depression. Mild paranoia. I recommend watching ET on this. Makes me want to stay in bed alone and read articles about conspiracy theories on my phone, if that makes sense.”"

jacked2008,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-hornet/reviews/1282671,"“Tried green hornet edibles. I've never laughed so hard in my life. I'm about 125lbs and had eaten dinner and 15mg of thc was a lot for me. This stuff is potent, but uplifting and lots of fun. I thought Step Brothers was the funniest movie I've ever seen and woke up with my sides sore from laughter.”"

I've smoked a lot of crazy shit but holy fuck was it a god damn trip. i started of dying from laughter as energy zapped away from slowly leaving me on the floor not wanting to move. This shit is great if you want to do absoulutely nothing. 10/10 Though.”"
