gnathen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1363876,"“Pretty good strain. Very euphoric, some arrousal, a lot of laughing and giggling. It does have a forest taste to it, like pine, but it tastes and feels really smooth.”"
mellecorriveau,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1416116,"“Love love love this strain. I have the CBD Rene variety and oh my does it work wonders for pain and anxiety. I love the fact that it doesn't make me really high, since it is at a 1:1 CBD-THC ratio. Nice mellow body buzz making me feel relaxed, energized, giggly and focused. It crushes down all my worries and anxiety and rids my body of chronic pain. Overall feeling of happiness and wellbeing.

I can smoke it during t...”"

JohnnyDopesick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1237736,"“I strictly smoke indicas, but this is one of the few sativas that I absolutely LOVE. Great for morning use (energy, appetite stimulation, focus, etc). I also noticed that this particular strain is great for treating inflammation -- I've had tendonitis in my elbows and knees for years and after just a few tokes out of the bong, I was bending, stretching, and ready for my yoga class. GOOD WEED!”"
promethus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1339641,"“Nice Sativa, stress reliever/ taste earthy, piney, like the outdoors. Has a bit of red hairs. Personally find good for daytime use. I do like sativas for daytime use for anxiety and sometimes its hard to find good strains. I would pick this up again.”"
WizardGanjalf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1230135,"“Wonderful strain, rose fregrance, sweet candy like smelling with pine notes that peak through. It's super smooth, great for pain, anxiety, lack of apatite & motivation I love this and highly recommended it to all my friends”"
meltingfish,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1338920,"“Best strain I've tried for my anxiety - I feel really giggly and things tend to slow down so I can notice anxious thoughts before they start. Some arousal and heavy munchies.”"
catpunsfreakmeowt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1363877,"“Awesome strain! The high is very uplifting, and puts a smile on your face. Relieves all pressure in your eyes, and is great for treating just about any pain in your body.
She grows great outdoors here in Oregon. This is the fastest flowering plant I've ever grown at 43 days (6 weeks), and she always returns >20% THC. Those Canucks sure can breed some righteous cannabis, eh?”"
DukeRaoul,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1580575,"“Got some of yhe CBD Rene. Probably my favorite CBD strain I've tried so far. Has a 1:1 ratio and a nice rose and pine flavor. Definitely not a super potent high but has a nice uplifting effect with pain relief on sore joints. I usually add this to other strains to bump up there CBD content or mellow them out a bit.”"
G68,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1671265,"“Major ‘arousal strain’ ... uncanny”"
petethekoala,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1368510,"“Very tasty herb. Taste like freshly cut lemon pectin combine with pine needles. Not very strong but still allowed some mind exploration. Great for beginners to initiate them to cannabis.”"
DemigodRob,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1201971,"“My all time favourite. This was the first strain I knew by name. Have smoked it in years unfortunately, would love to get reacquainted.”"
Sleeves28x,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1493897,"“By far one of my favourite strains ever . Love the story behind it . 
The names that people have come up with for strains is unbelievable . For me , having strains ,named after important people in marijuana history , just like the Jack Herer . Love that these strains are a part of a legacy . To me , whenever I see these strains actually think about the person that faught the laws to make cannabis a more available to ...”"
TopazRev,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1597126,"“CBD René is amazing!! One nice bong rip had me feeling good. Took another one and another one another one. So relaxing, no more stress. I’m a light smoker. Like 1g a week. But with this CBD I was so comfortable with it 5g in one night. Best sleep I had in a while 17 hour sleep. Knocked me the fuck out.”"
T0K3R,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1274372,"“I am not a fan of this strain, I've tried it a few different times and did not like it from any of the sources I have available to me.”"

nick77,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1319972,"“Worked well for my join pain, a bit more powerful vs the barbara strain of CBD I recently tried. citrus pine taste, mellow high.”"
dumbledank420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1468605,"“Nice, smooth and relaxing strain, gives an uplifting high, expected since it is a mix of Himalayan indicate and skunk #1. It's my go to sativa for a rainy day, makes all your worries and burdens melt away, and helps me allot with my chronic back pain.”"
Labman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1365717,"“I'm always a little wary of Hybrid Strains but Rene hits it out of the park. This Sativa dominate cross between Skunk& Himalayan is potent and not recommended for rookies. This smooth earthy Sativa is great for morning and afternoon but if you hit this mother too late you will have a long busy night. Rene comes on a ton with clear creative high with easy steady peaks and valleys. My dispensary suggested it for stress...”"
dpaul25,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1323016,"“Nice sativa with mild body effects. Great flavor.”"
cbjornson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1503629,"“I've been in sooo much pain the last two days. just remembered I had the CBD strain of this. rolled a fatty and within 5 minutes the pain is gone! I feel so much better.”"
kaminwolf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1280801,"“This is a good all around cheap strain that I always seem to get when its available. Mostly because its 60$ for 1/2oz and because it still surprises me in how decent it is. This one relaxes and mellows me, not the best for needing to do tasks and focus. Good end of day strain to just chill and watch movies to”"
SoulOracle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1225433,"“Bud tender at Seymour Wellness recommended this strain...was named rene haze... which was a hybrid of the two :) beautiful mix.”"
Vasishta,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1735152,"“René is up there with my top 10 unique smell floral pungent sweet its yummy! Its strong smell follows through into the taste that first dry puff off a j is heaven. The high is high strong potent no  couch lock but not that typical sativa high its different racy. Its perfect. My only gripe is she can have a bite cough cough lol. Loves cal mag! All through grow she will look like a candy cane lol shes frosty under a 30...”"
RedVans,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1700162,"“This one had me feeling very happy and stress free. I was excited by the 1:1 ratio on this strain, I vaped it and the good vibes started flowing. After an hour or so I did notice that my mind became very paranoid and restless. I was enjoying the slight high from Rene but the paranoia became very over powering. I also had a thumping headache into the second hour. As I said I do like Rene for it uplifting and happy vib...”"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rene/reviews/1305685,"“I found this strain to do literally nothing for me. I purchased 1 gram of Rene CBD to try thinking it would be a good daytime strain to relieve pain. I vaped about as much as I do other strains to get the right dose and felt nothing other than a bit dizzy. I topped up the dose and sill found very little effect. I would definitely never purchase this strain again.”"
