Something i would wanna smoke during the winter. the high from this strain is a nice "chill" high meaning you can get baked of this strain and you can act serious at anytime. so that makes this my fav. strain if im about to go somewhere”"
ssipe,https://www.leafly.com/indica/himalayan-blackberry/reviews/1399007,"“Really liked this strain, relaxed high, constant chill, but you could be serious and you don't look noticeably baked. I love the taste. It has a Christmasy taste.”"
Solomon1225,https://www.leafly.com/indica/himalayan-blackberry/reviews/1416455,"“A beautiful flower that tastes of berry and earth, Himalayan Blackberry may be my favorite indica. Very similar in comparison to Hindu Kush, although slightly less sedative - you can sleep or keep going on HB. It is fantastic for meditation, sleep, or periods of peaceful contemplation, although also excellent for casual creative tasks and playing video games. Provides moderate pain relief, although not ideal for seve...”"

It was hard not to smoke an eighth in one night. I'm an indica person so this suited me just right. In my opinion, it's up with some of those top indica dominant strains (blueberry, deathstar, fucking incredible, raspberry kush, C&C). There was not a big smell which some strains are just not huge smelllers. That's no...”"

Sascoltch,https://www.leafly.com/indica/himalayan-blackberry/reviews/1610918,"“This has a nice sweet taste and I personally a slight slight earthy aftertaste. But that's I interpret it, so please don't sue if you didn't taste that same aftertaste. 

I taste and smell are good, but I adore the relaxed state I'm in. Makes me wanna go take a mini hibernation.”"
Cattleya,https://www.leafly.com/indica/himalayan-blackberry/reviews/1500387,"“Perfect for unwinding before bed. Blissfully relaxing, both mentally and physically, yet I can stay awake and read in bed for awhile before drifting off to sleep if I want. Makes me quite sleepy, but not in a druggy, unpleasant way, just a chill "It's time to close my eyes and drift off" way. Hasn't made me anxious or paranoid at all.”"
MaxwellTrees,https://www.leafly.com/indica/himalayan-blackberry/reviews/1711354,"“A great strain to unwind from a long day at work. Cook dinner or get into bed, the dynamic high from Himalayan Blackberry will have you relaxed, focused and ready to chill. The sweet flavors of blackberry will linger in your mouth for a couple extra seconds after your first smoke reminding you of this strain’s heritage. Definitely recommend picking some up if you’re looking for a solid indica and your shop has it.”"
MadamCinnamon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/himalayan-blackberry/reviews/1713187,"“I tried this strain for the first time today and I have to say GREAT FREAKIN JOB GUYS!!! It's been so long since I've been able to find a strain that would actually give me the body high I was looking for and this one Definitely did it! It gave me that amazing calming and numbing feeling it was so nice. And the fact that the only side effects are dry eyes and dry mouth is a huge plus! This strain is definitely recomm...”"

onceahippiealwaysahippie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/himalayan-blackberry/reviews/1417683,"“I would give this strain 10+ stars if they were there.  I love the high I get when I smoke this lovely little morsel of happiness.  This is the high I've been looking for for the past 6 months or so. I can now rest easy and know exactly what I need to buy. I love the kick back feeling I get when smoking it. The box says it all......"Cannabis for a Higher Purpose"......couldn't have said it better myself.”"
