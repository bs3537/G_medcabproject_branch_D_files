The answer?

Yes. Temporarily.

This strain is the very essence of kush. Wrapped in an enigma. That is itself.

What does that mean? Perfect for gaming or just spacing out and listening to music. Theorizing about the meaning of life....”"

bmohr,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1372505,"“Oh this I think is my fav! so smooth going down and the flavors are so nice! high was a nice light indica, was still relaxed and pain free but not glued to the couch. Def keeping a steady supply of this!”"
adamjames,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1416403,"“Amazing High and Taste! One of the Best. Not the greatest nose👃🏼 but other than that a really amazing strain.”"
NativeOGKush,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1310916,"“This strain is the life of the event at any gathering. The first hit lingers in your mouth and nasal cavities desiring more of that complex taste. This hits the cerebral cortex and breathes clarity into the mind to advance your productivity into another elevation. You not only feel high as a satellite, you are able to function above others, unlocking the door to new ideas.”"
popeglazier,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1372508,"“Gorgeous honeycomb concentrate from Emerald avenue courtesy of bhomb squad.  Overwhelming flavor of skunk, I mean really really strong, so much so that it took me several sessions to identify the strong pine and mint notes that reveal them and dominate the exhale.  This one seems to be very very good for my pain. It's been a long painful week at work and this one promises to put me in a coma tonight. Probably not goo...”"

missleblues,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1368484,"“I'm not usually the biggest fan of og's but this one is something else. Flavor is on a whole 'nother level. I can't say anything as far as appearance of the flower since this was a concentrate but it's beautiful and I'm high as a damn satellite”"
thatCasualSmoker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1729538,"“Very noticeable pine/og aroma, though not as fuel as her other cousins like the planet series or king louie, tiger blood,..etc. Skunky but not too hard to smoke, kind of smooth, recommend smoking by bongs.
Slow onset but hits hard, can see how this causing paranoia to some ppl due to its intense upperbody high. The high is neither head or whole body high, just enough to feel the warm rush in between your jaw and ches...”"

Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1302845,"“Satellite OG is a great strain for relaxing in the evenings. Unlike some other indicas, it does not make you feel sedated immediately. It does, however, help bring on the sleepy feeling about 2/3 hours after consumption. This strain is quite effective at relieving pain with an overall lovely relaxed body and tingly sensation. It doesn't have that heavy head stone so I find I can still function reasonably well when us...”"
LilStoneyNell,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1418772,"“This strain isn't exactly my favorite. It's a good Indica in that the body high is pleasant but it gives me a terrible headache. Indeed my mood is calm and thoughts pleasant but there is an irritating pain between the eyes that persists as I smoke it. I would just say beware of the more physical side effects with this strain than plan to use it for relaxation.”"

TLMcDeez,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1227980,"“With a solid amount of crystals giving this bud a frosty look, this strain offers a euphoric high without excessive couch lock associated with other Indicas and Indica hybrids. Has a very earthy, but also very faint sweet taste. Love the high this strain provides.”"

Quazymoe,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1642977,"“This strain is amazeballs. The smell is beautiful and let me tell you I’m a blunt smoker but with this strain I only smoked a joint and was lit. Love this strain ❤️❤️❤️”"
emilysbluedream,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1314851,"“Vaporized the live resin. Very potent & cerebral. Nice to hit right before bed. A little too euphoric sometimes, but also grounding. Takes the edge off and lifts you up.”"
hjointsmoke,https://www.leafly.com/indica/satellite-og/reviews/1317573,"“Almost perfect for anytime, just a little too indica heavy for me if Im running around, but if I dont have anything to do, this strain is perfect. Great for parties and kickbacks. Lifts you up enough to socialize and keeps you feeling warm and happy until you pass out. Top 5”"
