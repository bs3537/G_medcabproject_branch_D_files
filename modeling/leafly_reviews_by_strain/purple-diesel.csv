Sapphyy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-diesel/reviews/1387201,"“When I saw Purple Diesel in the collective I about jumped for joy. Sour D being one of my favorite strains I knew that whatever the Purple cross was I would enjoy it. The buds were very fluffy and dark purple (There was almost no green on these buds) with long dark orange hairs. The smell? Heaven? It actually smelled quite like diesely berries.. But It was heavenly nonetheless! The high was perfect. Very heady and ha...”"

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-diesel/reviews/1365949,"“Hey, I'm a medical grower out of Northern California. I've grown two different PurpleDiesel strains over the years and my second strain has been my favorite. Both strains genetically turn purple even with <70 degree temps. The fan leaves on both strains also turned orange-red-purple-black hued. normally a mix with a major black/purple tip to stem. (I'm on my third rotation of the second strain right now) The flowerin...”"
anodyne,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-diesel/reviews/1387202,"“Vaped with a Pax.

Good results with both light and medium temperatures.  On light temp:  light head buzz, slight pain relief and tingles.  On medium:  nice head buzz, spacey and glassy cerebral high, decent body buzz.  Will not couch lock you unless you let it.

This can be considered a good wake 'n bake and a good afternoon strain.  Responds well to repetitive tasks and makes them enjoyable.  A good weekday strain ...”"
StudentOfTheHerb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-diesel/reviews/1393530,"“One of my favorite strains, and one of the few I can enjoyably smoke throughout the day. Very clear, creative high that propagates conversation, and socializing in general. Looks very much like you think Purple Haze x Sour Diesel would, and the same can be said of the scent. 9/10, highly recommended for anyone suffering from Social Anxiety.”"
Munchiez2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-diesel/reviews/1371101,"“pretty damn tasty and really stoney on the diesel side but giggly with the pre-98, relaxing and good for any time of day for me, it's a toss up between this and lucid dream for me though they're both really great.”"

I didn't even have time to research the strain, I was immediately hooked!!! Great for my MS fatigue, picks me up, and lets me go on with my day.”"

I know some of you might think content is average, but those of you that know what i mean should try this strand if your just trying to stop thinking and relax.

I have ADHD and PTSD and both are being covered by this strain. I am highly impressed with how, just content, it makes me feel.  If you're lookin...”"

Appearance: Quite nice. Trichromes present, but not very large and they sparkle dull. Not a strong odor. a hint of sour perhaps the  Dense nug weighed out at 3.7g.

The batch I received from a local dispensary wasn't grown with too much care so... 

There's that. There's a bit of sour citrus in the flavor, yet the diesel comes through too.

skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-diesel/reviews/1289734,"“It's a decent hybrid, very similar to Blue Dream, The main difference is that the Blueberry in Blue Dream lends a happy, goofy feeling whereas the Purple in Purple Diesel is more relaxing. And, like Blue Dream, it's mellow... maybe it's just me, but neither strain gets me really stoned, and they both make me sleepy if I over-smoke.”"

I feel happy like a handsome man just walked in the room and he's hilarious. I keep laughing and shit. Ok I love this strain obviii and you will too, bye. 

It smells really fruity but a mild type of fruity smell. The taste of it is like...earthy or grainy in a way. Overall, I LOVE this weed! Makes you feel...

You can't stop smiling and everything seems hilarious...Fosters creativity.  What's not to like?...I'll be buying it again.”"
