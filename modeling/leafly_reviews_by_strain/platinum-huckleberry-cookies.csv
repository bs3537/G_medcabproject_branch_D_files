Remedy394,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/platinum-huckleberry-cookies/reviews/1634386,"“Platinum Huckleberry Cookies is a favorite of mine for managing anxiety, especially social anxiety, migraines, and depression. In smaller doses it can aid in the creative process, help with some chronic pain, and make socializing even more enjoyable.
