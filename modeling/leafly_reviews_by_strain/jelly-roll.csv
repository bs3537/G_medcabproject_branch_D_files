Has an awesome sweet taste to it that packs some serious flavor. A very nice relaxing stone. Something to kick back and watch a show to and slip slide away into mellow ZZzzzz's. Would def recommend”"

Otherwise a very heavy sleepy Indica. Would be perfect for bedtime if I didn't feel the need to scrub my tongue of the taste...”"

Delicious taste, high is mellow AF, and you won’t need much. if you come across it and you need something for sleep it’s a sure go. pairs excellent with tobacco if that’s your thing. in a piece wanna slow roast for sure, so as to savor the taste”"
