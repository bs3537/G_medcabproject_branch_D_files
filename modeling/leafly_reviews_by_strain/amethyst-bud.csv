parismichael,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/amethyst-bud/reviews/1373841,"“Deep purple with white hairs. Nice to look at. Dense with quite a bit of THC all over it. Relaxing high. (alone/solo). Overall, typical high.”"

It's definitely a day time strain, very focused and mellow, it made my back pain non-existent. Fantastic stuff.”"
tntfam,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/amethyst-bud/reviews/1268800,"“I tried the Amethyst by Zion Botanicals last night after working a long day.  Made me nice and relaxed without being overly sleepy and added a nice touch of humor to life.  A nice mellow hybrid for afternoon or evening.  Mostly physical sensation, was able to be focused and clear pretty easily... at least clear enough to make Belgian waffles at 10:30PM.

Tasted pretty sweet and smooth to me, like rich blackberry with...”"

Sorbe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/amethyst-bud/reviews/1224381,"“I love Zion botanicals Amethyst best of all so far.  It's a euphoric, arousing blend that gets me both happy and pretty horny.  It has just enough indica in it to give you a nice body high, plus it's just a fun hybrid.”"

chebachavez,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/amethyst-bud/reviews/1254518,"“Back when I first started smoking marijuana it was either hard to find or expensive to find FIRE weed in my part of AZ... But when me and my step father came across this amethyst, dear lord we were in heaven. My guess is that the cut we received was leaning more towards a grand daddy purp pheno, considering it was pretty much purple all over and flooded with crystals... Damn would I love to see this one pop up in CO ...”"
DamienDarke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/amethyst-bud/reviews/1257915,"“This stuff is a nice color, and pretty to look at, but I would suggest not just smoking the buds.  I usually put it in a grinder with a kief collector and just smoke the kief (it produces a lot).  Smoking the buds themselves aren't that bad either, but you get more out of it if you collect the kief.”"
TooltimeL,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/amethyst-bud/reviews/1280698,"“I've only vaped it so far. Flavors have been tangie the first few hits and then turned to a dill to finish out the bowl. Great effects, especially for the price I paid, with a nice soft behind the eyes feel, floating in my head and body when I'm still but I have had no problems getting things done around the house today. I can't wait to put this in my bong tonight.”"
TheMachine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/amethyst-bud/reviews/1060914,"“medium sized nugs, fairly dense. the buds are covered in numerous right orange hairs, the nugs are light green and quite frosty. the Afghan Hawaiian was far more noticeable than the lavender, but towards the end of the high i began to notice the traditional "purp" high. solid 7.5/10”"

demis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/amethyst-bud/reviews/1183115,"“There's no category for the strain I'm smokin on which is :Fruity Amethyst OG. Which is obvious Fruity Pebbles x Amethyst. I must say the flavor and after taste of this flowers are mind blowing, ultra fruity berry like with hints of some sage. Very interesting strain , thc lvls were 22. Something % . Overall 7.8/10”"
snoqualmiesmoke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/amethyst-bud/reviews/1273760,"“Excellent. Tasty. Long lasting. Creative. Such a balanced strain! You know you have found quality marijuana when you smoke a single bowl and you are good and medicated the rest of the day. That is legit. Great bud Zion”"
