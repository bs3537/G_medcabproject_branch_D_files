Upon Enjoying a baseball bat the taste has that true earthy, minty with a hint of haze on exhale. She would treat you right on a Friday after work,  paired with a nice ale and some friends.”"

It was my first time buying a portable oil vape cartridge (co2 distillate). After smoking this strain I noticed a few things, the slight cerebral high was uplifting and it was easy to get up and get things done around the house. The cartridge really brought out the earthy/berry taste of the herb. Major cottonmouth, luckily I also picked up a 50 mg medicated pink lemon...”"

Small, loose, dark green buds covered in dark orange, almost brown fuzzies. A pleasing sweet & spicy aroma and flavor. Left me feeling energetic, happy, chatty and a little giggly. Being chatty and giggly is always amusing when I'm alone. It also seemed to relieve some joint pain. Pairs perfectly with Barbarosa.”"
