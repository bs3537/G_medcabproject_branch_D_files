TheMueller,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gold/reviews/1416513,"“Oh. My. God. White Gold is probably one of the best upcoming strains out there! 
This indica-dominant hybrid gives you an uplifitng and clear headed high, while your body is in a soft chill. Because of that, activities are still very enjoyable. 
For medical use, the effects can encourage to overcome social anxiety and depression, since they make you pretty talkative when letting them through. In higher dosages, White...”"
hjointsmoke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gold/reviews/1338009,"“Love it for its body buzz/pain relief and uplifting, clear head buzz. Great buds, greens and orange hairs covered in chromes. Very dense and sticky, little goes a long way, buz lasts for a little bit too but is so mellow you can study or hit the gym no problem for me. An over all great strain, Will be getting more asap, didn't know it was gonna be this good.”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gold/reviews/1331461,"“You know how all these reviews say it's super happy and social and uplifting? It really, really is. This happened last night:

-- "Did you have a good at work today? You're doing a lot of dancing in your chair."
-- "Not really. I think it's the weed!“

That theory was confirmed this morning when coffee and TV inspired... yup, you got it... more chair dancing. 💃🔥

WashingtonGreenery23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gold/reviews/1331460,"“Another more rare strain I have come across. And my goodness does this girl hit hard. Just took 2 bong rips and I now an hour later am writing the review. So pleasant. Stoney in the head without giving me the munchies. Soaking this sun up! The taste isn't my favorite. But when I can rip a strain and I don't feel the need to load another bowl for at least an hour is a strain to hold onto!”"
ccicero,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gold/reviews/1398327,"“Beautiful bud. So many crystals. Smell comes with it as well. You cannot go wrong with this strain and I won't be surprised if this becomes one of the more popular strains soon.”"

samhaimowit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gold/reviews/1203374,"“I absolutely love this strain! it calms me down and makes me feel absolutely wonderful, it's a great mood lifter and it smells delicious too. my only critique is that when ground and packed into my bong, it's a little difficult to smoke/start smoking, this strain is so fluffy that you need to pull pretty hard to get the hit going. but the upside of that's that it saves bud! you don't need to take that big a hit to ge...”"

Aksu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gold/reviews/1495332,"“Kind of a middle ground strain. When smoking alot and sitting on sofa or something this can be make you relaxed like indica, but when you start to move it goes up to the head and starts acting more like sativa. Citrus taste is very present which is nice. I ahve smoked it and vaped it. When vaped it isn't that strong, but I think this is due to the vaporizing since it's not burning.”"
