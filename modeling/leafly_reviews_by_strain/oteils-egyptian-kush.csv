First recreational dispensary visit. I got a quarter of Oteil's and a preroll, regret not grabbing some concentrates though. Taste was full kush and excellent.

Strong enough to ease muscle pain, and relax, but not so strong that I am unmotivated to get things done.

Gives me a nice goofy feeling in the head but I don't feel taken over. My body gets weighed down but not to the point where I can't do anything. Takes all of my back pain away and keeps the fun there too!”"
