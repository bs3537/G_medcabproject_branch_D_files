I don't take these sorts of claims lightly, either. This is an extraordinary strain, possibly conceived in another universe. It's euphoric highs and slightly fading streaks of color in your vision make this work of art a strain for the ultimate pleasure junkie.”"
Squatchmo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-hood-magic/reviews/1390611,"“A few minutes after smoking a half gram joint and I can't help but notice how incredibly stupid high I am.  Around half hour ago I was ANGRY or UPSET or DEPRESSED or all of the above; a few puffs away and I am completely de-stressed.

I'm willing to bet I got a sativa-dominant phenotype due to the spicy Durban Poison-esque taste and complete dissolving of stress/depression. Mt. Hood Magic is indeed mystical in the wa...”"

Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-hood-magic/reviews/1390828,"“Love Mt. Hood Magic.  Prefer the phenotype that leans towards Northern Lights #5, but both are great. The NL5 reminds me of a slightly more indica version of Memory Loss.  Very high and spacey.  Relaxation welcomes you, but a sativa edge gives you an alertness that doesn't leave you couch-locked.  Good for day or night.”"

gapernet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-hood-magic/reviews/1390827,"“First and foremost, this is an excellent strain for daytime activities outdoors, as are most from the Durban Poison lineage.  I have recently enjoyed it during casual river trips, the middle of grueling hikes, and days at the lake.  It has just enough body high to notice it, but not so much to lock you up.  Beyond that, it's an excellent high that feels like the middle of your frontal lobe is tied to a balloon that c...”"

peachesandcreme420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-hood-magic/reviews/1390831,"“The Durban has a wonderful tangy taste with a mellow cerebral euphoria, which I love for wake and bakes. The Northern Lights pheno on the other hand is much heavier, on the couch locking side. Has a nice piney terpene scent to it, along with a nice gradual body sedation.”"

skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-hood-magic/reviews/1326932,"“MHM will fuck you up. It's one of my go-to strains when I have guests in town... it's an impressive example of the wonders of legalized weed.

I live near Five Zero Trees and I admit I'm partial to their proprietary strains... love Salmon River and I swear by Oregon Lemons for mornings and weekend road trips. MHM was the first of their strains that I tried... on opening day, no less. 

I prefer my weed a little less ...”"
darkdragon333,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-hood-magic/reviews/1384886,"“A strain from my home state, this weed perfectly reflects the excellence you can expect from Oregon weed! It will fly high in the sky without couch locking you! It gives a little bit of dry mouth and munchies, but not too much! It is both a mind and body high, very spiritual and euphoric. I highly recommend trying it if you haven't!”"

 Great terpenes on this strain with a fruity aroma and flavor, although it had a more diesel smell during flowering. Buds were longish like a sativa, but ripened well.
The most striking quality is a great body rush without excessive couch lock. A very 'analgesic' smoke but not an excessive head high, I found i...”"

As the budtender said to me, "This is all sativa." She didn't lie.
