surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1411972,"“Alien Rift delivers a wonderful, long lasting "superbuzz". Played my guitar for several hours without stopping. Deep flowing from way inside my creative center. Music seems more organic, food seems to be more vibrant and delicious.  Mind focused not drifting aimlessly like the effects of so many Indica strains.”"
Panda4189,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1387551,"“Great! I first tried this while super stressed/depressed. A great mellow high followed, accompanied by a sprinkle of the giggles. Flavor is excellent- crisp, lemony, and earthy.”"

I picked this up yesterday and the bud tender at the store said he was afraid to try this. Naturally I asked for it and expected something intense. Then I looked it up on Leafly and all those descriptions are full bars. I was ready for anything.

So I vaped my first bowl.
And wouldn't you know, I watched a couple hours of 'Shameless' and did an hour of ballet. I wouldn't sa...”"
RWright,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1390239,"“Was looking forward to smoking this strain and wasn't disappointed when I did.  Bud's are absolutely beautiful, smell great and taste a bit earthy and chem.  Nice head high that makes even and old smoker like me a little chatty, while also helping great with pain, anxiety, nausea and appetite.  Really helps keep me going strong around the farm but, don't sit down to long.  You  might not get back up.. 

Would buy aga...”"
WashingtonGreenery23,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1328403,"“Delicious. Realxing. Spacey. Perfect high! I'm so chill after a bowl. I recently converted back to flower from concentrates. And this is probably the best I've smoked. Came from willie nelsons reserve. Great smell top notch! A bit pricey but that doesn't have anything to do with this SUPER!”"

SativaKushFairy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1368822,"“My second favorite strain . The taste and look isn't the greatest , but the effect is so crazy euphoric especially for a heavy smoker like myself”"

KenMensch9,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1695592,"“Wonderful lemon overtones. Nice relaxing destresser. Leaves traces of nappies. It's excellent for hunger. Made me talkative and happy. I would def buy this strain again if potency is high.”"
ABQjoe,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1345642,"“I really love it when you get a strain that screams quality breeding, (or was one lucky accident that seems like quality breeding); well, this is one of those -for me anyhow. This particular batch of Alien Rift was grown by a medical dispensary in New Mexico and is a very pleasant strain. Although Rift is described as powerful (24% or higher), this particular batch had 'just' 21.1% THC and .12% CBD. To me, it really ...”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1592967,"“Very good for physical pain/ discomfort. I probably won't buy this again because I get horrible paranoia and anxiety for the first 20 minutes after I smoke... but the narcotic-like body high and peaceful mind that follows is almost worth those first 20 minutes. Almost. For those of you who get the good parts (feel like you're being swaddled in a soft, warm blanket) without the bad stuff, I understand why you love thi...”"
griz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1332408,"“Very interesting terps! This cut i have is super potent very hash like smoke & high. Love it. In rotation. What a stank it's also loud”"
inditiva0,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1323828,"“Super sticky indica with chem and citrus flavors. Intense body high with some tingliness.”"
highsethjohnson,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1334056,"“Bought this last night. After smoking I felt pretty spacey and before you know it I was eating half a bag of chips. After a few more hits, I was knocked out. Great strain - Highly Recommend.”"
reddawg777,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1317943,"“Well the first thing is i was surprised it didn't taste a bit Sweeter , other then that it put me in a kick back relaxed feeling and forgot about my neck so that's good ...”"
redraven051,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1418176,"“Best way to describe it is it makes me stupid, in a good way lol. My perception of time & distance is all out of wack, it's a strong high that is very relaxing & good for after work or before bed. I've had super weird dreams since smoking this strain though. Also the munchies are real with this one. I obtained this strain at a dispensary in Alaska.”"
Berrypopsix,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1494429,"“👽 🍇 😋 OMG This strain is out of this universe... so smooth, with a subtle grape aftertone. This is a relaxing indica dominate strain that’s great for pain relief and for sleep. This smooth hitting strain is one I would definitely recommend as it’s so damn delicious and hard hitting. 

This is one flower I won’t forget! 
My Rating: 4.7

gearysouzam,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1533390,"“Awesome strain! Picked this up at my local dispensary today on a whim, looking for a new indica to try. I smoked a pre-roll, and after 24 hours filled with panic attacks and near puking, I feel so relaxed FINALLY. This was exactly the strain I was looking for tonight, and I recommend it for anyone who is feeling very stressed, and needs to relax!”"
Sideshow47,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1620910,"“Wonderful lemon and somewhat diesel smell. Great taste quick onset with a slow come up and plateau. Worked wonders for my back pain in a dry herb vape. Long lasting high that comes in waves. Hesitation is key when re dosing. Plan on getting another one from dispensary A.S.A.P.”"

jamaicadreamin99,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1512648,"“I love Alien Rift! This is a great indica for sleeping, relaxing, and chillin. I feel very uplifted, relaxed, euphoric, emotional and tingly with this strain. It's a really heavy hitting indica. It's definitely going to make you feel 'stoned'. I even felt a lot of a head and body high. The taste is also incredible, like grape.”"
Migguers,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1722957,"“I like this strain very much because i feel its able to ease the body without blurring or overstimulating the mind. Helps me with muscle pain/spasms and anxiety while managing to leave me focused energized. Would definitely recommend for any level of smoker, specially if you want to unwind but stay productive”"

SomeNorseGuy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-rift/reviews/1345166,"“It starts out mellow with a wonderful flavor, but it gets harsh half way through a typical joint. It did provide a nice high for a minute, but then it just made my wife and I pretty anxious.”"
