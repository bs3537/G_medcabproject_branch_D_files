The taste is sweet with a strong acrid sort of quality left behind. It's not bad tasting at all. Definitely avoid daytime use if you need to think or be productive by day.

Even though one parent is a pretty strong sativa, the effects are all indica.
Upon the first dab I feel every muscle being to relax. After the 5th dab I feel so relaxed and loose, like jelly...
The taste is earthy and sweet, the effects last at leas...”"

PennsylvaniaPaul,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-black-angel/reviews/1377322,"“Great strain.  The indica effects come on first for a relaxing high with minimal anxiety. Then after about 30 min it shifts to a more sativa dominant high.  A very enjoyable flower that is both sweet and citrus limonine smell with a dank old mans jacket undertone of myrcene that meshes well. Due to a great terrapin profile it is very enjoyable to smoke.  it has a decent tolerance to nutrients but I recommend TLO for ...”"

BTR612,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-black-angel/reviews/1377332,"“It can definitely creep on you but only over about 15 mins I'd say.  Best qualities of this strain are insomnia relief (Number 1!), and relaxation that can be a bit mind-numbing at times. I find myself zoning out inadvertently.  Not necessarily a bad thing. I only smoke this after 8 p.m. or so myself, although the strain I got tested at 10% THC so overall it's a moderate high in intensity and strength.  Has a unique ...”"

"This is so nice".

This strain is such a beautiful and calming type. My body felt great, almost totally erased unlike other indica that fee almost heavy in their body effect.

Slept like a damn rock.

Today I'm smoking early and feel pretty motivated as well as it hasn't affected my brain too much.”"
