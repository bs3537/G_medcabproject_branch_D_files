It tastes like grapes and has a slight berry flavor. Testing at 24℅, it definitely took the pain away and left some room for excitement as well! Perfect strain all around!”"
Shindou,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-martian-kush/reviews/1252596,"“Love this strain, best tasting I have had yet. Works perfectly for my digestive and pain issues, allows me to sleep well and doesn't hit me with the munchies too bad.

The flavor is a bit of an oddity, inhale is typical weed taste with a slight grape-berry note. Exhale is that grape-berry note full on, as in, I felt I was eating this odd fruit.”"

It really takes the edge off after a long day at work or school or anything really but it isn't too overwhelming. I just felt relaxed and could finally breath a sigh of relief. If you smoke more than your fair share, you will fall asleep fairly quick if you lay down. I wouldn't recommend to use during the da...”"

If I smoke it throughout the day I’ll take restful naps, and before bed a long night of sleep. I don’t recommend it if you have a busy day and indicas tend to make you sleepy. The buds do flake apart and create a ton of keef which made its affects much stronger. I like to use this when I have breaks or on the weekend.”"
