For the averege none medicated user it's good for deep meditation and relaxation. You feel the haze roll in over your eyes and your and you get a thousand thoughts on your mind and become extremly relaxed. Smoking it makes you feel like all your problems go away.  It's a super effective strain if you want to get the ...”"

A nice sticky strain loaded with crystals. The smell is a fruity and hazey. Smoking it in a joint - the taste is very strong and pleasing. As a heavy smoker I almost, almost, had to put this one down half way through but I am glad I didn't. Sat here happily stoned on the couch. Not one for doing stuff on but I guess you could if you really had to.

15 mins later...
This shit ...”"

Excellent spicy but not overwhelming flavour even on the dry toke.
Definetly a personal favourite 10/10.
Would recommend!!”"

sarcaviol,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-haze/reviews/1351821,"“Oh you can smoke lots of strain, but if you really smoke "some strong sh*t" choose this. Critical haze is the most reliable strain when you wanna get high af. If you smoke very good genetics and quality grow; almost 4-5 hours you'll f*cked up. You'll relax more, you'll laugh more and you'll thank me later. Also, i think it's not good for daytime use, because you will feel your legs are very heavy.”"

Joshi_Hiroshi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-haze/reviews/1788871,"“After the fifth hit I already started to notice the "heavy-legs" after approximately 10 minutes I needed to sit down as this stuff was hitting me harder than a pink, fluffy atom bomb. 

Otherwise, after an hour I was already feeling clean again, so I guess it's perfect for a break from work, etc. 

Bit to strong for my kind of taste but otherwise a really nice experience.”"
danielito,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-haze/reviews/1201976,"“I smoke this strain..what a high!! 100% relaxed on the bed..but not sleepy. Not the best taste but the smoke is too sweet with citrus influence. This strain fucked me, shit..real mental trip. Moreover, i had very very dry eyes..RED EYES. One of my favourite strains..five stars!”"

HayDongChonhChong,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-haze/reviews/1312656,"“Kind of made me sad. Took a lot of effort to get me high, but once high the full body affect was nice for my blown out wrist. Soothing but not a great choice for long time "medicaters".”"

MalteBlume420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-haze/reviews/1737744,"“Typical feeling of smoking hybrids. First you are very talkaktiv using long and complex sentences. After that you feel very relaxed. Your body is painted with a clean stoned feeling.”"

JamesPR,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-haze/reviews/1701369,"“Got a fruity taste and a marmalade-like smell to it. Gives a nice relaxing head and body high but with some slight paranoia and anxiety if smoked too much. Makes you hungry and tired but overall a good strain and you can certainly feel the indica dominant effects.”"

I was in a great mood, mentally present albeit absentminded. It gave me a pretty decent case of the munchies, too, which is good if you have trouble eating enough. This is easily a new favorite of mine.”"
