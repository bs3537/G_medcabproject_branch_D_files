GinoMidnight,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunburn/reviews/1386359,"“This strain is actually really good. Usually when I take sativas, I usually don't feel it to the point where I LEGIT feel truly hyped up to where I can't sleep. I usually can sleep well even if I smoke sativas, but that is not the case for Sunburn. I feel hyped up, I feel awake, I feel ready to go, and I've never felt like that towards other strains, even other Sativas. Also you don't have an extremely higher appetit...”"
bgon4abit,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunburn/reviews/1385775,"“After trying a gammot of strains and never really connecting with one SUNBURN has been the best for me in helping my anxiety and depression without getting me paranoid or giving me the munchies. This is super important because those 2 take me down a horrible spiral. Another great attribute to the SUNBURN for me is I don't get a headache from it or to that total fuzzy brain feeling. Great for work and staying focused ...”"
DominiqueCarnuccio,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunburn/reviews/1382383,"“Mello relaxing feeling. A little heady, and definitely increases appetite. Good for the day, helps with exhaustion and spasms. I smoked it, but am looking forward to making butter with this one.”"
aurumjd,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunburn/reviews/1374371,"“A clear but motivating strain.  A rough landing if using all day and stop.  When you need that extra kick, get sunburnt.”"
StonedTemplePilot,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunburn/reviews/1443381,"“I bought this strain mostly out of curiosity, because I was intrigued by it's history. If this strain came to the USA because some Vietnam Veterans brought it home from the war, I wanted to try it. The buds from my dispensary, Compassionate Sciences ATC in Bellmawr NJ, are gorgeous: bright and tight, and covered in beautiful, frosty trichromes. The smell is kinda floral, with earthy undertones. It's a sweet, very gen...”"

SlickRickTheStick,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunburn/reviews/1387974,"“First off excellent name for a sativa strain around the spring/summer time. Plus I love the genetics of this strain. i got to know this strain over the course of a month with multiple quarters becoming an ounce fast. This sample of sunburn had dark lime green buds with light and forest green hues and a crystal like trichome layer. Sunburn has a super citrusy and earthy scent with the tiniest hint of sweetness/lemon. ...”"

leagleaglechickidee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunburn/reviews/1637592,"“amazing strain. I had to shy away from pot for a while, dealing with new anxiety issues and everything i experienced made it worse... and was honestly scared to smoke again. i also have chronic joint pain, and i have to say, sunburn opened a new door. zero anxiety, rather a quiet mind and i can still 100% go about my day. amazing.”"

jason102001,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunburn/reviews/1687442,"“Picked up an eighth from Curaleaf dispensary. This strain came in at 16.03% THC and vaped at 375 F. The high was lightly energetic but not too intense, heady buzz. Nice flavor of lemon and butter on the exhale. Great for a wake-n-bake session or anytime during the day. Not recommend for a nightcap.”"

NotTypical,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunburn/reviews/1720609,"“I purchased Sunburn as a pre-ground "ready to roll" mix from Curaleaf. It is a wonderful and potent strain.

At first smell, my nose picked up a sharp citrus smell. It is pungent and will tickle your nose when you smoke it. Thoughts are clouded and worries are placed at ease almost immediately. Physical energy and reflexes seem to remain unchanged.

When smoked, there is a dark floral aroma with a musky aftertaste th...”"
BenDeLaCreme,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunburn/reviews/1418198,"“Optimum strain for first timers or people not as experienced,  a high that isn't too overwhelming since it's about 16% THC, a rather bubbly high, I definitely would recommend this strain”"

MattVenture,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunburn/reviews/1791705,"“Citrus tones really come through. Euphoric high and very active. Definitely a sativa leaning hybrid, this one will tend to hit you pretty fast before you realize it. Great for starting the day or doing something enjoyable that involves critical thinking. Induces hunger a bit more powerfully than some other strains I've come across. If you have trouble with appetite I especially reccomend. Otherwise a fantastic smoke ...”"

The buds are super dense, almost no trim, lots of orange pistils.
 The effects are characterized by an uplifting, tingly feeling that relaxes pain and sharpens the mind. Aches dissolve into warmth to allow freedom of body and limb movement, thus allowing activities and productivity like proper medicat...”"
