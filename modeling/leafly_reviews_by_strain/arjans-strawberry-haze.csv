No chemical, un-flushed taste at all. In the grinder, a hint of strawberry-ish fruit. (one)Hit went straight to my head and I commenced with my plans for the day, which did not include sitting on the couch in front of the TV or being too high and paranoid. With headache gone and a nice creati...”"
Sativa-T,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/arjans-strawberry-haze/reviews/1342626,"“This is an amazing clear headed high. Tastes so smooth, like a strawberry milkshake with a freaking cherry on top.

This has to be one of the smoothest buds I've smoked in a while, the smell of the nugs were sweet and the nugs themselves were dense, it's what you would like to see in most buds, I would buy this strain again 100%!”"

The smell is amazing but for me the taste isn't anything notable. High only last 70-100 mins for me from a full spliff. Wouldn't be in a rush to get again.”"

Someone already mentioned it being like when you first started smoking and I couldn't agree more.
