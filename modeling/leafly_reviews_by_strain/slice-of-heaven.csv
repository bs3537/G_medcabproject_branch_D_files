Slice of Heaven

el sebo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/slice-of-heaven/reviews/1592081,"“I'm not sure if it's the same stuff I picked up in Vegas but if it is this is by far one of my favorite strains. It made my vacation the memorable event that it came out to be. The quality is amazing overall. It's got looks, smell and leaves a surprisingly good aftertaste in your mouth compared to over strains I have explored.”"
