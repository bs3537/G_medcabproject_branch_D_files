I smoke everyday, but I don't smoke all day, I usually smoke after work, so like mid afternoonish. lol & this flower relaxes me and I always feel so light. I do recommend this strain if you need a good dat bomb relaxation time and just want to feel groovy ✌🏽”"
israeltumax,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1371378,"“It had me dazed on my couch just watching tv or asleep 
Felt well rested the next day ! 
Great for pain! Stress and even insomnia !”"
limpidiota,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1392515,"“Being a big fan of blue strains I immediately jumped all over this when it became available. The smell is your typical blue strain. Fruity, sweet and a slight bit of earthiness, these buds are dense and very attractive. Burned evenly and hits you like a calm storm. I really enjoy the high without being glued to my couch or bed. Relaxes me on a whole new level but allows me to function and not feel sluggish. If you ha...”"
billyen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1336253,"“Very nice high, mentally relaxing but quite focused at the same time with a moderate amount of body relaxation. I personally suffer from general/social anxiety and this relaxes me with out making me feel self conscious about being a bit stoned.”"
TwistedRose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1414670,"“Nothing to write home about. Smooth smoke, mild flavor, subtle high. Relaxing and sedating but not strongly so. Not a bad bud just unremarkable.”"
ThisIsArziki,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1284748,"“Nice strong skunky smell when nugs are broken down by hand, I got a batch with small dense nugs that were great for packing bowls. Indica highs can be expected from this strain, putting you into a deep relaxation after a dose.”"
muffin26r,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1371934,"“This strain a good my buddy rolled me up. so I can't speak on how the buds look. The feel is great I was happy and relaxed. You don't get the couch potato feeling. Best used to make everyday activities more enjoyable”"
excaliburxxl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1336252,"“3.5 stars. It's not the densest bud. Doesn't break down well. It's a creeper. But the high is on point.”"

HazeRage,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1253448,"“A lot like blue dream without the dank haziness... Strong blueberry flavor with a danky fuely afghani undertone. Dense resin covered nugs, the buds are really beautiful. It's like blue dream in some sense, an indica blue dream with a fuely danky underside. While it is good smoke, I prefer blue dream over this.”"

J4rhe4d2323,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1197583,"“Strong berry taste! careful tho, dont plan too far ahead because this buds' is a creeper.”"
Whitefall,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1236237,"“This wasn't a favorite of mine.  It makes my husband and I feel "hung over" the next morning.  Nothing some coffee won't fix, but it's hard to get up in the morning when you feel super lethargic despite getting a full 8 hrs of sleep.  I haven't encountered another strain (yet) that's done that to us.”"

CDnDenver,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1265930,"“Very mild skunk but sweet aroma. Very sweet taste but a small spice note. Nice comfortable body high. Very relax but very alert. This strain is not very potent in thc or the CBD is real high and balances out the thc because I just can't seem to get very high on this. Smoked bowl after bowl last night and never got more that a mild buzz. This also left me unable to get to sleep as I was to alert and wired. This strain...”"
jpearllove,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1193239,"“I love this strain, and vape the CO2 concentrate. It's a very relaxing and mellow high. No negatives!”"
NVKgreenery,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1426179,"“Probably one of the best I have ever smoked- honestly so tasty and fragrant, leaving you with a deep, yet creative stone that encourages conversation and makes good delightful.”"
Audaz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1188647,"“I always called it Blueberry Afghani, a few other people I know do to also a few songs about it. I smoked this a few times and this is a super relaxing indica. You tend to find it harder to speak depending on your intake and tolerance, but that is really the only con to this strain. I like this strain because of its taste and it really treats you well in the long run, does really good for pain also. If you have an op...”"
Gardenmannn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1275861,"“One of my favorite strains, heavy high but doesn't knock you out. Tastes great if you like sweet bud and has a nice aroma. Try it out if you get the chance, or don't.”"
MoonBunny93,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1358890,"“Very strong Blueberry smell and undertones to the hashy, earthy, and skunk filled Afghani. Purple coloring that fades into a beautiful dark blue. Great choice for a mid day strain.”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-afghani/reviews/1521752,"“Bright green tight nugs with sprawling orange hairs. Smells like berries, hops, and wood. Tastes big on the berry and hash. Smooth and minimal lung expansion but has a creep that expands more after a few breaths. Feels very relaxed, slightly happy immediately. After awhile sedation and hunger kick in. Very good strain. I would get again. Recommend for late nights kicking back.”"
