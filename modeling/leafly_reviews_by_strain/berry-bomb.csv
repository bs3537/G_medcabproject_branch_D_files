=============
cmc31,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1266825,"“Cross of a hand selected Blueberry mother with the all powerful Bomb #1 father.  Buds are super frosty with a sweet berry perfume and taste. The plant yields as high as 20% THC content and is an indica dominant hybrid. This strain gives a clear head high along with a slight relaxed feeling. Giving off a strong pungent smell but has a sweet blueberry flavor that you would expect from a blueberry strain.”"
DChaCha,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1357657,"“It's dense, it's frosty and it will put you on your ass singing along to classic rock hits before you realize 15 mins have gone by and your mouth feels like the damn Sahara desert. After curing the severe Cotten mouth you can then enjoy a nice relaxing nap where ever your at or relax on the couch and daze out to a shitty cable tv show.”"
nhall98,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1489247,"“This strain is the perfect strain to smoke when you want all the benefits of being high (relaxed mood, muscle relaxation, clear mind, euphoria) without ganja goggle vision. Didn’t put me to sleep like most indicas, just relaxed me and made it easier to fall asleep.”"
strychninecandy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1378790,"“I obtained my most recent batch from Metropolitan Wellness as grown by Alternative Solutions in DC.  It was lab tested at 23% thc and 7% cbv.  the flowers are tight, pale moss green, absolutely covered with crystals.  the taste, vaped via a pax2, is lightly berry-flavored with a rich earthiness. it took about five minutes before the high came quickly a-creeping. as sometimes happens to me with many indicas, I had a s...”"

dankqueen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1375885,"“Nice taste of blueberry. Mellow relaxing But uplifting. This would be a great daytime medicine. I believe with a bit more it would help you get to sleep. I am an indica lady,But This is a very SWEEET bud.”"
DaRizza666,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1361302,"“Since I rarely smoke I only put a pinto bean sized amount in my glass. Tasted really fresh and almost mentholated as I exhaled through my nose. It's a very mellow body buzz and feels great after my long week of construction work. No anxiety or nervousness at all. I am just feeling quite pillowy. Only draw back for me is that it expanded in my lungs a bit, but what could I expect from an old school short pipe. Highly ...”"
p0kecyn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1207556,"“A sweet strain. The high creeps up and has a short but hard climax. Kinda disappointing how short the high is. Makes me KO everytime though lol”"
grekit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1073296,"“This strain was pretty bomb (pun intended). 

It hit me pretty hard, but in a good way. I felt like the head high was pretty intense for the first 30-45 minutes, then it mellowed into a nice whole body high for 3-4 hours. 

This strain is delicious, tasting of berries with a woodsy afterthought. 

I got this as a sample from a friend, but I'd definitely buy this strain if offered to me.”"
GrownInTheNW420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1208974,"“Berry Bomb is super impressive. She is a massive producer. It grows vigorously once rooted. At about three weeks it turns from a pretty frosty green to a light purple with loads of white hairs. Berry Bomb smells amazing!! Like berries!!! It's probably the prettiest strain I've grown so far. My previous favorite being Cinex. Cloning her is easy, however a little slower to root then I'm used to.”"
HerbeHeureuse,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1750084,"“The concentrates by Buddies have gotten stronger lately, yay!  The one I'm vaping today is Berry Bomb, which tested at 90.5% THC and .483% CBD.  It's an indica leaning hybrid whose parents are Blueberry and Bomb #1.  

There's a definite yummy warm berry pine taste to it and it really helped calm me down today before going to ecstatic dancing this morning, as I get a bit anxious in crowds.   I just moved and swayed t...”"

Puffalo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1275054,"“Berry Bomb 80i/20s - I had three combustible tokes before hitting the lawn with the mower. The blueberry taste wasn't there this time.  It gives a nice body, relaxing buzz with some sativa-energy effects. I cleaned the lawn like a whistle and enjoyed the sunsetting.  Afterward, I had some Blue Dream to keep myself away from the TV and couch.  Berry Bomb is nice but I'd go with Mother of Berries.”"

Zero,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1073297,"“Smoked this in a couple sessions. Smoked it with the lead singer and bassist of a band before seeing The Casualties play a dope set. Definitely some dope bud for some dope times. Buzzed off one bowl. Alleviated symptoms of anxiety and ADD through palliative treatment. Could Have been better. Still some outstanding Mary.”"

RDWright66,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1291762,"“Nice smelling bud, I thought was a little harsh when smoking though.  Found best for me when used occasionally.  Well rounded sedative effects with your normal indica compliments.  Does well with my pain,  but doesn't help with my appetite or stomach discomfort.”"

Audio_Geek,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1412539,"“Although the aroma and flavour are outstanding, I haven't had such an uncomfortably anxious high off a particular strain in ages -- Berry Bomb makes me feel like I am about to die.  Definitely not for the hypochondriac.  

Unless you're socializing or are an incredibly experienced smoker with brains of steel, do not smoke this weed -- you will freak the f*** out;  Tight bulging eyes, incredibly dry-mouthed, sensitivi...”"

By the time I finished it I was almost asleep on my couch. Good strong berry smell and taste, definitely a good PM strain, knocks out anxiety and relieves stress.”"
Richieandannette,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1317641,"“Love the way it burns and smells, good for depression and right before you want to eat. But be ready to smoke for about a half hour if your smoking alone because it burns so slow and stays lit. Works good for nerve pain.”"

RWright,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/berry-bomb/reviews/1341892,"“Berry Bomb is a pretty decent indica dominate hybrid.  I'm primarily a smoker, but will vape this strain from time to time to enjoy smell and taste. Works well for pain, anxiety and nausea Have used different thc strengths from 18 to 23pct. without noticing much difference.  Strong berry aftertaste.”"

It's super easy to grow for a novice, although it will stretch a ton if you're lights are too high, so be careful with that.  It may have been the pheno I got, but definitely not the biggest buds, however, they are about the densest buds I've ever personally grown.  

I don't really get a blueberry flavor though.  Definitely an earthiness to it, and maybe a little sweet.  W...”"
