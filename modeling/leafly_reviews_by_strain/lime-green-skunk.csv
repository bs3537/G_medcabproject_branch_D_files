I've said it before, I like to be active when I medicate and this strain is like a pre-workout drink. it's perfect for a nice 30 minute HIIT routine, then a decompressing stretch session.”"

This an excellent hybrid, would recommend.”"

A very great energetic high, that really seems to mute grey down feelings both mentally and physically, and bring out higher, more talkitive sides. Very great for every aspect of enjoyment”"

I have home hobbies that I need to be able to do even when smoking, and this allows me to focus. Anything that helps with ADD while getting me lifted is gold. This one is better than most for me.”"

(nugs are still dense, however) Very loud strain, loud as in stinky and strong. A bit smoother and 'less aggressive' than your general sour diesel, but just a bit... I love this strain, really a great choice when stopping to think about it. Smoking from a bowl and a paper/blunt are completely...”"

Lemon.n.fig,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lime-green-skunk/reviews/1499317,"“Love the citrus and tropical aromas! Very lime-y, like a green skittle before they went and ruined them with that sour apple crap. A nice balanced hybrid that gives good clarity. Potent, too! I like it a lot!!”"
boxfamily,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lime-green-skunk/reviews/1361352,"“Very strong smell, decent citrus taste, beautiful dense nugs, it explodes in a grinder. It's great for rolling, just save a nug for the end as this bud flakes. The high is kinda energetic at first but really mellows out and you become really focused. Great for relieving pain, or relaxing when you first get home.”"
KushGypsy420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lime-green-skunk/reviews/1376519,"“This was really easy to control my buzz level with making it easy to stay productive and sociable. I hit this before my shift and was not going through typical bipolar mood swings. Focus came easy and  not at the cost of getting stuck in my head”"
patsxbl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lime-green-skunk/reviews/1327622,"“very sativa like. had me feeling very chatty and buzzing. great flavor - like a fresh bag of limes. made my eyes feel kinda numb/tingly.”"
JJS1234,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lime-green-skunk/reviews/1061328,"“Strong Lime taste (if this is the correct strain I am reviewing. My supplier only refers to it as Lime.). The strongest side effect is that it will make you tired. Higher doses may make you very dizzy.”"
NerdyMo420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lime-green-skunk/reviews/1359507,"“Maybe more like a 3.5. Not sure if it's the same strain it's just called Lime Skunk. Decent 50/50 hybrid. Some body relaxation along with a little euphoria. Nothing too special or exciting. Taste is earthy and a hint of spice. I like the high CBD content of the batch I got of 1.26%-adds to the mellow body and mind feeling.”"
