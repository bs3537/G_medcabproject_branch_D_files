I always try to keep some on hand , this stuff is a great anxiety reducer !   Several dabs of this , and I'm ready for anything ! 
Usually before flying ✈️  , I take an anxiety pill .... the last time I flew I did  Afghan Haze dabs throughout the day , and it was an excellent flight ! 

The taste is ahhhhmazing!!! 😛💚 you feel your face going numb pretty ...”"
mackelprangb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-haze/reviews/1414851,"“Very different nose on this raw flower, also very unique in flavor. The high, though, is absolutely incredible! Very happy and euphoric.”"
harless428,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-haze/reviews/1351984,"“Out of all the Afgan strains, this one is the best. I love all Afgan strains but this one is a long high, smooth, not very tasteful, and a very dank smell. I stayed high for about 3 1/2 hours and when you peak you get the munchies, extreme munchies!”"
bme0002,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-haze/reviews/1414855,"“This strain is fire. Lasted super long. It made me wanna spit bars, even though I didn't. I wanted too though.”"

Trying this strain was a last minute decision because I impulsively wanted a preroll. The budtender told me they have a 5 pack of five different strains to choose from. Afghan Haze was the only hybrid, so I chose it. Pre-rolls are hit or miss with me in the way that they burn. This one burned slowly and ev...”"

AndreaN,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-haze/reviews/1285432,"“The Honeycomb by : CannaVative is Good Stuff 😄👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 
THC- total 75.39 % 
CBD - total 0.56 % 
Instantly numbs your lips and mouth ! 
Helps enormously with my FMS pain , great daytime medicine . Able to get quite a bit done as long as you don't medicate to heavily 😄  
I like the texture of this honeycomb- pretty easy to work with - even burns ok on top of a bowl .”"

Kushkulov,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-haze/reviews/1163171,"“It started as a very tasty uplifted high. Very energetic, euphoric, etc. good for getting work done. Lasted about 2 hours with the last 30 minutes a very relaxed body high that hits suddenly but peacefully. 4/5 because as a hybrid i wouldve expected a little bit more body but as an overall it was very pleasant and i definitely recommend to first time users as an entrance to the types and for old time users as a mood ...”"

I havent done that in YEARS and it was amazing! As a person with anxiety and a migraine sufferer, i was neither anxious nor did the migraine (that hit on day ONE of my vacay) i found myself with last. I cant stop telling people about it! A++, 100% and wow. Afghan Haze is definitely the bee's knees!”"

I’m currently vaping this through an Avitas cartridge and it chills me out and relieves my tension headaches while providing me a good boost in creativity and focus. I tried it while socializing with friends and had an amazing time, and now I’m currently sitting in my room working on art. It’s the first time I’ve met a strain that’s great for both social and solitary activities. While I was wi...”"
dylynbaldwin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-haze/reviews/1262358,"“it has a very nice blend of both Indica and stativa, calling for a relaxed but alert effect. it leaves a LOT of resin in your piece, so I recommend scraping and/or cleaning often.”"

jarko,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-haze/reviews/1147726,"“Yellow/Golden bud with Green and Dark Green scattered throughout. This bud is covered all over with brownish-orange hairs and tastes very earthy. I don't get a strong immediate taste reaction like the chemical or tropical tasting buds. It's a natural taste. It has a rich, light woody smell. The high is an enjoyable high. I am uplifted and euphoric. I feel zoned in to what I am doing,  so it is and inspiring smoke. Th...”"
elibaker97,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-haze/reviews/1212700,"“One of my new favorite strains! The high comes on just as smooth as the smoke goes into your lungs! I noticed that the high is very heavy cerebrally after the first few hits, and I was carried up to a heavy spacy, trance-like sate for quite some time. As the effects lessened, a mellow feeling of body relaxation comes on, perfect for patients suffering from pain, stress, or depression. I would recommend to any patient...”"

dogscanlookup,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-haze/reviews/1365067,"“I added this concentrate as a little boost to my bowl when I vaped while working all day. Initially the high is great. clear head, productive and focused. Unfortunately, I tend to be glued to my vape while I work so having to much during my day would make me crash hard later in the day. Great strain, but too much will send your ass to sleep!”"
TCK43,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-haze/reviews/1272918,"“The cannavative group killed it with this one. Smokes great. High is clean. Smoke is ckean. Burns all white ashes and smooth. Lacking some serious terpines though. Virtually no taste. Will continue getting their honeycomb as it is made from clean products like this!”"
pawel7441,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-haze/reviews/1392011,"“Top best strain I tried so far,  good focus while working and even nice boost of euphoria  before work out. For me works with almost all!”"
