TheStonedNerd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dragon-og/reviews/1380128,"“A very happy high. While not a debilitating effect it still comes across as a very relaxing euphoria. This is a great morning time strain to go along with a nice cup of joe.”"

A phenomenal strain for the true Cannabis Aficionado who enjoys the overall experience of the senses. It has a pleasant aroma and a very rich flavor profile, with a mellow and yet energetic buzz. This has become one of my favorites of the OG strain line, right up there with Deadhead OG and Burmese Kush, except D...”"

I got a few TOP NOTCH buds of this bad boy. Results may vary.

It smelled like oranges and was covered in that "sugar" with some orange hairs on it. Very dense looking green bud. 

I lit up. The throat hit was extraordinarily light ... I did not cough or feel a burning in my throat at all. The flavor was not great however. It tasted very chemical-ly  and sort of like pine sol. Some people might dig that b...”"

p.s - Will try in the day forest later could easily hike and sight see on this. shout out to Bud Nation. Also I want to play cards for some reason too. Like baccarat for instance. 🌝”"

Have to say the bowl definitely laid me out. The Pax 2 at medium heat gave a really good clean high. Super heady and I think both of us got going a bit.”"

Actually that's not all I can say lol

Stopped by my local on the way home from work tonight and The coolest budtender EVER led me straight to this strain they just got in.

Honestly, I don't remember having 1-2 hit ganja for a lonnnnng time, especially since I'm a daily toker but this strain REALLY is. 

And it hits fast & hard too. This strain pulls no punches, it's BAM...out of the gate in...”"
Anubiz333,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dragon-og/reviews/1510927,"“This is an exceptional strain that really compliments a friendly hang out sesh or really just chilling and playing some DND, because let's face it...it's Dragon OG! Sweet flavor with notes of that really stoner friendly OG on the back end. Highly recommend you give this one a try if all the dragons haven't already gone up in flames and smoke.”"

Jaedyn887,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dragon-og/reviews/1588105,"“Love hybrids!!! 

I'm absolutely IN LOVE with this strain!!! When I first saw this strain I loved the way the bud looked. The buds themselves are very dense. light green with VERY visible pollen on the outermost layer. 

The flavor of this strain is semi sweet on the inhale. faint hint of bubble gum. On the exhale a nice smooth, cool, slightly peppery flavor. 

The effects of this strain are extremely versatile. Drag...”"
jimmyinspazzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dragon-og/reviews/1449238,"“Phenomenally stony strain that is felt from first inhale like a smooth sizzling warm sensation growing outward from chest & nasal area.  The odor of this bud is very intense, beautiful & unable to be hidden so heads up.  If there was one word to describe this flower it would be "content".  Strong enough that one toke of the flower will leave user on a calm ride for a few hours.  When there is a need for focus this is...”"

Dense buds green leaves small brown hairs and nice trichromes

Diesel strong smell to the bud, slightly citrusy piney notes 

Sativa most definitely gives you a face numbing high but no headache 

A good am strain .”"
Cannasquisher,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dragon-og/reviews/1514029,"“I love pressing this strain into tasty rosin. The flowers I bought were tested at 27.9% and yielded 23% at 200F for 3 minutes under 2 tons of pressure. The rosin was a light tan color and buddered up nicely. Very light, fresh taste but not floral or fruity. It is the most potent of the 12 rosins in my stash right now and rides the line between sativa/indica so is good for both relaxing in an alert way or being produc...”"

It was an intense high for me. If you lookin for some dank that will have you stuck on stupid if you let it here you go. Hit too much and bye bye to what you had going on. Get comfy. HIGHly recommend 4.7 🔥🔥”"
