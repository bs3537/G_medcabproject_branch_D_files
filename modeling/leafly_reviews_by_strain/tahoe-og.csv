Tahoe OG Kush
=============
Krshna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-og/reviews/1416046,"‚ÄúThis is without a doubt the strongest OG Kush I have ever tried. This is a very heavy, very potent strain of OG. It has the classic OG high but it's markedly stronger than any OG I've had in recent memory.

The smell is the classic OG smell, piney and fresh. Just inhaling this weed lets you know it's dank. You almost cough smelling the buds, the aroma is so potent.

It also has an intense body/mind numbing effect. Except for headaches.

This is not a weed you want to smoke outside. It's definately a sit-down weed, to the point that if you try to be active after smoking it you'll get a headache.

Our plan was Netflix and chill plus tacos, so we picked up some Tahoe OG to facilitate the process. Our awesome budtender at New Vansterdam confirmed that Tahoe will make tacos, Netflix, and chilling highly appealing.
