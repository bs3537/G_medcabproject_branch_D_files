I always look for new Indica strains for my various ailments,& decided to give this one a shot. This has a particularly higher CBD content than any other strain I've tried , as well as a lower THC content,at least from what I've read. Somehow this creates a great relief for my constant muscle/joint pains as well as has stimulated appetite & helped me fall as...”"

Not like going down to the pond and chasing kushs and Girl Scout cookies. This Hammerhead shark... she'll swallow ya whole in her high. Little head, little body, down you go... into the couch.  And it's gonna hit you quick, that'll bring you back like tourists, that'll put all your businesses on a payin' bas...”"

I've tried medicines and nothing ever gave me relife. I got this strain as a gift and I didn't try it for a while since I am not a big smoker. One day I was having some major pain from it and couldn't really do anything besides lay down so I smoked it. A little while later I was up and ab...”"

Overall : 10/10 my first time ever seeing hammerhead and it was masterfully done the sour dub is a welcomed cross due to how heavy hammer would be alone . Unless your in the humboldt county area as I am good luck find...”"

esellwood,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hammerhead/reviews/1544990,"“This is an interesting strain. It's listed as indica but mine was measured at 26% thc and the dispensary agent said it would smoke like a sativa.

Very mild and little to no smell to it. Very piney and spicy through my vape but was surprisingly smooth on my lungs.

As for the effects, it hit me hard at first with strong euphoria and mild cerebral buzz. I struggle with appetite and this strain gave me a lot of munchie...”"

It wasn't the stinkiest, but more than made up for with it's powerful indica body buzz and euphoria. I also didn't feel any pain. I can't wait to hit it tonight!”"

Would love to shake the grower’s hand. Hammerhead is hard to find — only 13 Leafly reviews as I type this on 4/3/18. I pounce on it, and suggest you do too, whenever it’s available. 
Call me crazy but post-grind, HH almost smells like pickles. Wtf, you say ? It does - sometimes “piney” and “earthy” just don’t cut it for me lol. 

Noticeably SMOOTH, can rip big ol’ fashioned bong pul...”"

Merge216,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hammerhead/reviews/1574226,"“Stumbled upon this strain at my favorite dispensary. Love the body buzz. Hit fast and superb right from the jump. Head buzz is noticeable, but still alert. Couch lock activated. This is a great strain for pain and for chilling on the couch. Don't make any plans later if you smoke this!”"
caw90,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hammerhead/reviews/1609488,"“It had been about 2 years since I last smoke and got out of smoking due to panic attacks then I tried this strain. It had a good stank on it with a good taste to follow. After consuming the first 30-45 mins were filled with lightheaded paranoia. Then we were off to the races for a fun filled evening of shooting pool, jamming vinyls, and socializing amongst family. It was a solid euphoric buzz and as I suffer from Bip...”"
Rcharnock,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hammerhead/reviews/1786450,"“generally I've heard of hammerhead having a lower thc content, however our local dispensary had some testing at over 30%. by far my favorite strain yet. as a veteran smoker it's hard to find a strain that makes me as giggly as this.”"
