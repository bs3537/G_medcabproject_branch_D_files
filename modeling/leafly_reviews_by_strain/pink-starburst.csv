Pink Starburst
=============
okayoldbay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-starburst/reviews/1559668,"“This strain has a distinctly earthy and floral smell to it, almost like a coffee with some hints of berry or 'flowers' (just flowers in general). If you think of Starbursts while smelling it, it will in fact remind of the Pink variety, and none of the others. It's almost like the "artificial-ness" of the Starbursts coming through, but replicated using earthy, floral, and a hint of berry notes. 

The taste is sort of ...”"

Very uplifting and euphoric without any drowsiness or raciness. Herbal anti-depressant. Not sure whats going on with these reviews, usually they are pretty good guide but the one's for this strain are all over the place. If you like Diesel crosses this is definitely worth checking out, a new favorite for me.”"

I have anxiety, and at first smell I thought it might be a little too sativa-ish for me, but it wasn't. I will definitely be getting this one again. :)”"
RyByrdland,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-starburst/reviews/1417923,"“This is one of my favorite smelling and tasting strains. The taste is fruity, sweet, and floral—somewhere between Tangerine Power and Rose Bud. I would love to taste this in a vape-oil cartridge.

The high is mellow and functional—a great strain to burn after work. I didn't fixate much on the negatives, and it didn't power me down. You might find yourself unusually grateful for a turkey sandwich.

While the pink cand...”"

punkprincess42,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-starburst/reviews/1394791,"“One of the best strains I ever had. Somehow smells and tastes just like pink starburst, and even for veteran users, this stuff works effectively and efficiently.”"
acatalepsyy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-starburst/reviews/1417922,"“It's okay. More of a weed that you'd save for a "last resort". Distinctly earthy, may be overpowering to some. I wouldn't recommend it personally, since it made me slightly nauseous after my high began. If you have other options as far as strains that you use more frequently, just take that instead of this.”"

———
Flavor-
Inhale: 5- Tricks your senses at first with a flavorful, sweet & savory taste, then sucker-punches you with a hot & hardy finish. Could be overwhelming & is very reminiscent of “strawberry cough.”
—
Exhale: 9- Strong, flowery & a subtle smoky flavor with a lingering sugary, tropical aftertaste.
———
High: 8- Very nerve tranquilizing effect with a tingly head & shoulder sensation. Great for day & nig...”"
dam63,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-starburst/reviews/1707734,"“This one was a bit strange. The taste was like biting on a flower.  Not a fan but I'm sure someone else would like it. It kept me up all night so for someone with insomnia like myself this only worked during the day. The high was pretty good but at times would make me a bit dizzy,so small doses were best. The plus side it helped with my chronic pain.”"
PHANTOM_XRS,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-starburst/reviews/1632696,"“This strain smells very floral and earthy and it does have a pink starburst undertone to it. Upon visuals it looks like dj shorts blueberry kush. It has red-ish color hairs, a mint green look to it, and it's caked with trichomes. My first dose I felt a strong cerebral feeling in the center of my head. I sort of felt stuck. I started to feel a lil relaxed and ended up watching some netflix. I'm usually the connoisseur...”"
EpicDabby,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-starburst/reviews/1767344,"“It really does smell like a pink starburst fell into a small patch of moss. Also kinda like walking into a Lush store as far as aroma.

The high is very clear headed and it decreased my pain and depression.

Flavor is amazing. Very sweet smoke on the exhale. Vaping it longer brought out burnt sugar and spicy notes.”"

When high you feel like can overcome any kind of panic attack and just feel amazing! just so amazing and taste so yummy.  great high”"
Trooper11,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-starburst/reviews/1418521,"“Looks nice, smells odd. 

Tastes like pure poison and chemicals. 

The flavor is as if I am heating compounds from under the kitchen sink. I can't even describe how gross the first draw is. Reminds me of formaldehyde. Upon inhale the body wants to reject this smoke. Gag, a sickening, vometous flavor. 

On the other hand, whatever it's laced with begins to work quickly. I'm concerned it may be sprayed with synthetics....”"
