Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-power/reviews/1366395,"“Tangi power bud structure has a very full look through it the trim is perfect has a Christmas tree all leaves and branches pointing upwards to a crescendo of orange and green twirling leaves at the very top. 
The toke of the strain is very smooth and provides me with a lot of relaxing comfort but soon slowly starts to build into a very nice happy creeper I would suggest that this is more for a daytime and not recomme...”"
tallbosnian,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-power/reviews/1375467,"“Absolutely a must try for anyone. Smoking is not harsh and the taste is bar none. Personally, has to be top 3 on my list due to the fact that it takes away chronic back pain and those awful back spasms. I also noticed it helps with depression by giving you instant cerebral euphoria, followed by a full body tingly sensation that lasts me for a good few hours in the evening. Don't get it twisted though, this strain can...”"
vinceA1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-power/reviews/1361067,"“Tastes really good, like fresh oranges. More of a stable, focused, type of high. Definitely would recommend this for people looking for stress relief.”"

eminellenbach,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-power/reviews/1363723,"“Very relaxing strain. I had awful cramps and I smoked this and felt all my body pain melt away (which is exactly what I needed). It is not easy to focus on this strain, I felt it was difficult to carry a conversation. Had some trippy effects, which I enjoyed :)

openlyginger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-power/reviews/1341805,"“Update on this tangerine power rosin. It's the perfect high. The hit was smooth on both the inhale and exhale. So I guess that makes what, both the hales I guess. The flavor tasted like sugar cookies to me. It instantly relaxes me, melts away anxiety and muscle pain, super happy, chill, and totally high for at least 2 hours per fat rip.”"
KaosDaKlown,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-power/reviews/1375468,"“Looks & Aroma: Buds were decent size, dense with just the right amount of cure, not too dry, not too moist. The citrus smell hits you first, then a light floral and earthy undertone.

Breaking Up: Broke up really nice, with just about the perfect blend of mini nugs and powdery shake to roll a fat cone, joint or blunt, or to pack a fat bowl to go around more than twice in a room full of people.
Usage : We used a bowl ...”"

taniasue,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-power/reviews/1321303,"“I've tried this in pre-roll and flower. Both were good. Citrus hits you as soon as you open it. Flowers are dense, bright, a little sticky. 
Very calming head high. I hv MS & some other health issues like Anxiety & PTSD and I'm feeling great. Anytime high.”"

Just going by name alone, I really wasn't interested when a friend told me about this strain but when I saw it at the local shop and it looked really nice (bright and dark green patches, extremely dense, and frosty) so I gave it a try. It's a really really good strain or Liberty Reach's version sure is. It's super flavorful with berry and citrus notes even taste alittle lime...”"
persian503,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-power/reviews/1266174,"“Tangerine Power is an interesting mix of sweet blueberry flavors with a mild overtone of citrus/pine.  She mellows out really nice in the vape and becomes very sweet and candy like.  I feel like TP is more on the indica dominant side of the hybrid spectrum with plenty of body high but it is very nice!”"
