becjenn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1393741,"“I love this strain in RSO form (also called Akorn). It relieved a lot of pain, and helped with abdominal pain and inflammation caused by my crohn's disease. It seemed to take care of my inflammatory arthritis as well. It gives me a "fuzzy" feeling that makes the pain go away.”"

comparible to GG for me love this shipz dont let the name fool ya winner.Been awile since I've seen this strain.
Deep rich nutty chestnut vanilla flavor's almost immediate relief with anxiety and depression.
Budz were tightly compacted color flew of Miami hurricane color's.
KOBE STRAIN !”"

Warning! You need an air tight container, I threw away the package this came in into my home trash, ran some errands, when I returned my entire house smelled like a dispensary! This stuff is no joke and not to be messed with as a novice... Enjoy -”"
cascadianmass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1229565,"“Not so tasty, kinda dry.  Very Light Green, and the buds all look like little mountains. Good high-percenter....but the high just doesn't last. Kinda tiring really.”"

T.I.N.G.,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1310824,"“Works better than any other strain I have found for cramps and spasms. On the downside the aroma is off the charts. Vacuum tight container is required or the hut will smell like you have a pet skunk.”"
marsimp2017,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1485940,"“My newest favorite! Uplifting and almost energetic. Focused, but relaxed and mellow.  Perfect Hybrid in my opinion.  I do love the noticeable body buzz that certainly helps with the achy joints and bones.”"

dankduck420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1249811,"“Although this is a hybrid It has an intense body high indica dominant good for relaxing and sleeping”"
llmead,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1690585,"“This strain is dope, whether you call it snow bud or akorn. You can tell that it’s almost exactly 50/50 sativa indica. As a person with anxiety I find that it doesn’t make my anxiety worse when smoking it. Doesn’t taste the best but it’s worth it for the high”"
standard540,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1455053,"“eighth for 20$ and I'm thinking this dispensary value smoke is great to sit back n cheif a couple bowls and has a nice high”"
PepperSloan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1609878,"“I found this strain to have an almost coffee-like flavor at a low temp but when I raised the temp just a little bit, it began to taste almost like a “burnt homegrown." Bleh! It’s a strain, in my humble opinion, that should be vaporized at a very low setting for flavor. I think trying to smoke it in a joint or bowl could be a little harsh. 

The mood of this one was great and I felt very happy. But, I got very little ...”"
validflub3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1515933,"“This strain seemed to give me an almost dizzy nauseous feeling when I smoked a lot of it. Personally wasn't a huge fan of the high and got slightly paranoid, but some of it was pleasant.”"

armyvetAZ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1290772,"“This has quickly become one of my all time favorite strains. Sunflower meds here in az has this strain regularly and it is always exceptional. I use this strain like most would have a redbull when I have homework. Uplifting but doesn't make me feel anxious. The flavor is very earthy and woody. It does indeed taste like oak or acorns.”"

armyvetAZ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1339609,"“My favorite strain. I get this regularly at sunflower meds here in Phoenix and it I'd grown and cured to perfection. Very earthy flavor with a clear headed hybrid effect.”"

becjenn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1519567,"“Aka Akorn. My first review of this strain was for the RSO only(Bloom-PHX is great for strain specific RSO’s). I’ve since had crumble, shatter and flower. The fact I’ve tried all should tell you how much I love this strain. I do prefer the RSO, however, they ALL are miracle workers on my arthritic hips (inflammatory arthritis). I’ve yet to find anything that works as well as this and it seems to help my crohn’s diseas...”"

purdykj3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-bud/reviews/1336840,"“I have two reviews to make.
First to Leaf life the Dispensary, they are second to none. They think of you the patient firs how, they don't sell products that don't do the same. Their price range is lower with a much better product. You should travel to only shop from this Dispensary.
Second this Flower, it was frosty with orange crystals every where. Great for bedtime, or chillin on your game console. (PAIN FREE)”"
