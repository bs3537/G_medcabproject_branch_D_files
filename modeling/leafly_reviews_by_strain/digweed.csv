Definitely helps me relax and makes it easier to get to sleep, but is by no means a couch lock. In fact it makes me super talkative when smoked during the day.”"
WolverineCub,https://www.leafly.com/indica/digweed/reviews/1393670,"“High in CBD. I found this strain to be the Best for Pain. There is No Paranoia ever. It has a flavor of Tea. I noticed it takes care of IBS (Irritable bowel syndrome), Stress, Depression and Anxiety. The overall effect is Happiness.”"
MrMedi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/digweed/reviews/1393671,"“Digweed is a strain acquired by Tilray originally in seed form from the seed company House of the Great Gardener. They then grew it themselves and releases it to their patients. this is a very unique strain. Super Dense, small yellow rock hard nuggets are what my sample was composed of. It smells unlike anything I've ever smoked before. So intensely reminiscent of a lemon cleaner its ridiculous. Has almost a Vicks® l...”"

Very smooth, relaxing mental effects. You just feel so happy and find yourself smiling while pain is fading away and you just feel so relaxed.

Disclaimer for all ladies out there: It was that 'time of the month' again and this strain completely killed the belly pain, muslce soreness and nausea. I was just there sit...”"
Corijo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/digweed/reviews/1332175,"“I have been trying high CBD strains to see if this helps with muscle tension and spasms so I was happy to see this as an option to try.  I don't know if this was only for this crop, but the cannabis that I received was very wet and harsh to smoke.  I found it offered very little relief from my symptoms and actually made my lungs sore after a few days of use.  I would not recommend this strain at all.   I am hoping fo...”"

This package was dry like normal tilray it was a good buy other than the price $9 a gram would have liked to see it around $6.”"

FogMachine,https://www.leafly.com/indica/digweed/reviews/1376173,"“I've been smoking from a bag of this for the past week or so and am finding it to be one of my favourite types of highs. It's very relaxing and uplifting, surely thanks to the higher amount of CBD in it, but it also allows me to sleep very well after smoking it a couple of times in a day. Anxiety and stress, for me, have been the top things that this strain helps with. I wish it tasted a little better but it smells n...”"

oldfartincanada,https://www.leafly.com/indica/digweed/reviews/1328606,"“Powerful, ass-kicking, major league body high that lasts for hours and hours and hours. Lemony/earthy flavor that is excellent to vape but if you're doing a bowl, mother of Jeebus, this stuff burns all the way down. But it's worth it. The stoned sense of peace and contentment is ethereal. This high CBD strain is awesome for my severe chronic lower back pain. I felt no pain whatsoever. Prepare, however, for an endless...”"

billzipz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/digweed/reviews/1310148,"“Nice bud, real fruity on the exhale. Definitely relieves the anxiety and you can still function. It's a good day time smoke if you still have things to do.”"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/indica/digweed/reviews/1312721,"“Digweed is a high CBD strain with reasonably decent pain relieving properties. It provides a relaxed feeling and a very mellow buzz. Overall a good strain but nothing outstanding about it.”"
