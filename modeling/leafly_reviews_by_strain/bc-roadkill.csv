I am super high" .Works wonderfully well on migranes I had one this morning and a half hour after smoking realize its barely perceptable now.No sleepiness or 'couch lock' w/ this one- very funtional, good for daytime.”"
Processean93,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bc-roadkill/reviews/1410875,"“I like strains that have a strong psychedelic edge, with heavy audio and visual sensations, so this became a personal favourite for me. I didn't experience any creeping, it came on fast. Music and visual enhancement, best of any strain I've ever tried. A nice steady euphoria (if that makes sense), without any speediness or anxiety. The whole time, calming waves roll through the body. Long lasting, too. Hit at 3pm and...”"

Not as heavy body high but very strong mind high, has you chasing your train of thought... Can be pretty creative too, (if your short term memory can keep up) and can get you energetic (if you`re not lazy and unmotivated). Lots of laughter”"

I do not like strains that cause anxiety or paranoia of any kind so I am very particular with the strains I like, especially hybrids.  This is Fun!!  A light, euphoric kind of floaty high.  I could function comfortably and I felt so nice.  I have some social anxiety and I had no problem being in a social situation. It is a relaxed, and a really different than anything I have tried. I ...”"

Brenkin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bc-roadkill/reviews/1062834,"“Really good bud. 
 
Smoked a couple of bowls and a joint of it and I must say, this bud is great. I feel very euphoric, a nice tingly sensation as well. 
 
Makes me hungry too, and food tastes really good with this. 
 
Music is also highly recommended by me.”"
Spacer1337,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bc-roadkill/reviews/1060147,"“This strain is grown locally from someone I know, but the seeds come from British Columbia. The buds are beautiful with long red hairs and colored purplish-blue. It has a really strong scent hence the name BC Roadkill. 

When it is smoked the buzz is very euphoric and causes you to become very creative; artistic beyond belief. 

Overall it is one of my favorite strains of bud that I smoke, I recommend it to anyon...”"

But, that smell meant an equally dank high. The buds were frosty af and had some slight blue-ish hues. Very cool strain.”"

stone33,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bc-roadkill/reviews/1164022,"“Not only is this the first strain I've ever tried, but the hands down best I've ever had. This potent bud is good enough to rival any top strain in the world today. it is a creeper with a strong euphoric relaxed high. This is also the one of the most stinky buds I've been around.”"

I called the next day, to order more, but, alas, it was gone, like the wind. A very popular strain in Seattle, when you can find it. I don't think it's being grown here yet, but such a fine strain will be coming to a store near you. I loved the high from this. A solid performer. Whether I'd been smoking a lot, or had been on a break, ...”"

Not skunky like I thought it would be, instead a nice clean berry/pine smell, so delicious! A nice Netflix and chill strain. Thanks Smokey Mountain Express, this one's killer!”"
