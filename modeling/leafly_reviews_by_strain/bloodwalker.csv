Will lead to a strong desire to watch Jason Statham movies. 
Body high coming on. Head high fading. Might come back though. Close to a 50/50 hybrid? No. Feels more head dominant.

This was super uplifting and made me energetic without paranoia in a large crowd, huge dry mouth though.  I don't suggest vaping it, the diesel becomes over powering in taste.  It was epic in a blunt with a bit of fruity pebble crumble, they made for a great pain relief team.”"

Golden amber peach fuzz hairs & trichomes covered the lime green with a touch of purple buds.Had short bright orange fire pistils. The sweet, berry, & diesel smell & taste had me uplifted, happy, & very calm. Stay Elevated!”"
