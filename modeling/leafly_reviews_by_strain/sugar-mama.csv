TGT,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-mama/reviews/1398468,"“I know that genetically Sugar Mama is an Indica, but for me it's like the espresso of weeds.  Awesome daytime strain, when you want to power through your To Do List and earn your day.  Although I've noticed that since it is genetically an Indica, it's also great for dealing with any physical aches and pains, and I'm not physically jittery at all.  Just focused and in good spirits.”"

I use it to help me sleep at night, but I've found it to be an excellent daytime strain as well. It's hard to overstate my satisfaction. One of the greatest things about it is how uplifting it feels. It's not that I don't dwell on sad things, but I process those things as less intense or personal. I wonder if this is how people without chemical imbalances feel al...”"
redbull1133,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-mama/reviews/1386575,"“I will second the fact that although this is an Indica, I had a great energetic and creative rush upon smoking. doesn't take much to get the job done either. There was a mild head and body buzz that was nice yet not overwhelming. One of my favorite kinds to smoke.”"

sniperkitten,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-mama/reviews/1416906,"“Amazing if you had a shit day at work and want to decompress. No dry mouth but I find that the effects work faster if you sip on warm tea between smokes. Highly recommended.”"

Kwihnai,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-mama/reviews/1316404,"“This Indica Hybrid starts off with a very Sweet Citrus with Turpentine smell and smokes very sweet. When ground up it gives off a bit of Dank Cheese and the smoke is very smooth. Great for people who smoking flowers makes them cough. The high is very heady at first but turns into a relaxed euphoria that makes you want to stretch out on the couch and chill. Overall a great smoke for unwinding at the end of the day.”"
