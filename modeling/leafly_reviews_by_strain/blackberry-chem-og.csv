iBobs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-chem-og/reviews/1336617,"“Blackberry Chem OG by Fireline in Washington State. Tested at 29.3% THC.
Beautiful darker green buds totally covered with trichomes and strong shades of purple throughout give this strain an almost breathtaking appearance. Sprinklings of medium sized orange fibers give this bud a gorgeous “blackberry” finish.  
The aroma however…. was absolutely lackluster. As in it really didn’t exist. Faint notes of berry could be ...”"

If you have trouble staying focused or getting shit done, snag a bag of Blackberry Chem OG. You'll be micromanaging your life in no time. When you gotta get shit done, this is a go to strain. Don't smoke this shit come sun down, the head on this strain is a tad strong to promote relaxation.”"

Medium in the bod, medium in the head.  I have severe generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder naturally and this strain helps me feel a bit better.  Plus it helps alleviate some of my back pain.  The negative effects on here show it may cause full anxiety but I seriously doubt it.  If you're not looking for top she...”"

Gave me the most hilarious munchies, laughed away stuffing my face and still am 😂

After a while I mellowed out and felt really nice, think I’ll try smoke smaller amounts of this stuff at a time..

I’m baked”"

skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-chem-og/reviews/1660138,"“Smoking the Green Line/ Fire Line Blackberry Chem OG. Agreed with iBob... virtually no odor, which I'm fine with... The high is nice, very mind numbing. I took two hits about a half hour before leaving the house, and I forgot where I was going several times on the way. This is the kind of strain that will have you staring at a blank piece of paper for 20 minutes, you know? That's not a criticism. It's indica leaning,...”"
