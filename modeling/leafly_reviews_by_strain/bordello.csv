Bordello
=============
Bacon420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bordello/reviews/1389593,"“I'm usually a strong Indica user but today I decided to get silly and try Bordello!  It's spongy and sticky with red and orange hairs.  As we brought it home (sealed in a plastic bag within a closed paper bag) the smell of this stuff filled the car!  It was like the smell of a fine cup of coffee or a fresh skunk on the side of the road!  As soon as we got home, I stuck a half bud into my pipe and lit it up!

Nothing....”"

I am bipolar and I have massive mood swings that can make me spiral into depression and anxiety. this strain is what has helped me the most with stabilizing my mood, and helps me cope. very good for helping you through anxiety attacks and crying spells.”"

I've searched for years to find a strain that makes any notable difference in my "normal" everyday pain level. When I read about BORDELLO, it sounded like porn for chronic pain and I wondered if it could possibly be what it's described to be. 

Unfortunately, the one dispensary in my area that carries it never has it in stock. As soon as they get it, it sells out. Just mad...”"

It keeps me relaxed and calm when I eat my meals it helps me get the hunger I need to eat when on meds yet lets me relax my stomach after I eat for another 30-45 minutes which by then I'm calm and watching a good movie or enjoying the excellent body high.

PEHOWIC420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bordello/reviews/1375742,"“I'm personally a sativa fan, but I am a huge fan of Bordello as of recently as well. Spares the user of muscle/bone pain, relieves headaches, relaxes the mind, and isn't hard on the eyes. With beautiful dark pine green buds. Very euphoric but would suggest as a night time smoke. 💤💤💤”"
chinkeye,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bordello/reviews/1364566,"“Very nice strain...the smell and flavor is magnificent.  While smoking a spliff my lips felt like they had been touched with novacaine.  Nice relaxing high, blue dream like.  I kept social and had no paranoia.”"
Ickkii,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bordello/reviews/1374281,"“Whoever said after work strain nailed it. I just picked some of this up and it smells very sweet, like some seuno I smoked a while back. It isnt as sweet as it smells but leaves a good after taste and an even better high. Very laxed and my body hurts a little less too. I'm giving positive feedback to many things while under the influence of bordello. My cut was 20% THC, rather dark green buds.”"

This strain gave me the most horrible panic attack. I’ve never experienced anything like that, ever.

kyleGHAD,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bordello/reviews/1298257,"“I got some Bordello budder by 710 labs from Live Green Colorado. In honesty, it was just because it was at 81.8% thc and they had a $20g wax Wednesday. After getting home, heating up the nail, and inhaling a chunk of that budder, I felt like my mind was in a bordello (brothel). The sativa pops out with the feel good, happy, giggling high.

Lili3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bordello/reviews/1765191,"“Bordello is a strain that pushes my thoughts and dialogue inward. For some people this is a great thing but for me, it exasperated my depersonalization and I was floating uncomfortably outside of my body and extremely quiet to outsiders. I couldn’t really get a word out, and really didn’t want to. I can see how this might be helpful for those with add, adhd, or behavioral outbursts but not for anxiety or depression.”"

The buds were trimmed to perfection to reveal the intricate colors and subtle hues. The buds were Frosty but not extremely coated in trichomes like some other strains. The colors and aromas still had me intrigued. 

When the budtender opened the jar the first smell to hit my nose was a cherry cordial followed by a lingering dark chocolate aroma.

It's like sniffing a blueberry danish! I personally appreciate the dry mouth because I never remember to hydrate.  Had it in a bowl, will have to check out vaporizer next. Sis that has MS loved it, for physical, but the lack of focus on mental might put this one on the back burner for her.”"
