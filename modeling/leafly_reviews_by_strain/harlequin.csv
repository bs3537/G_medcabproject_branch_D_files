I am 30 years old and had not done cannabis before. I was researching ways to heal my gastrointestinal inflammation and bleeding, which contributes to most of my other problems (allergies, hormonal imbalance, fatigue, exercise intolerance, etc) and decided to give cannabis a try. 

I did some other strains before trying a high CBD, low THC...”"

I started smoking cannabis Junior year in High School.  We probably smoked every other day.  This was with close friends.  We smoked A LOT!  Usually blunt size cigars filled with cannabis.  We usually had a good time.  Laughed, got hungry, socialized etc.

Harlequin does the trick.  It's not very heady at all and takes care of the conditions listed above.  As others have said, if you feel anxious or paranoid before you medicate, you won't, I didn't feel that way after.  Enjoy!”"

My job basically consists of me working out for hours on end. A  bowl or two definitely helps with fatigue or the irritating feeling of lactic acid build up without feeling very much in the way of mental effects. I would recommend this strain to pretty much anyone who does manual labor for a living. :-)”"
