MellowSmoove,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glass-apple/reviews/1410370,"“Just picked this up about 40 minutes ago from Native roots. I got a joint and this is a great day time strain. I am a lot more energetic & happy. "uplifting" is the word I'm looking for. As we speak I am high af and can function very well. I actually don't mind small talk with my customers. 

I don't recommend smoking this at night if you're trying to get some sleep. It is definitely a more adventurous type of smoke....”"

VERY nice strain.  It creates an uplifting happy feeling, with lots of motivation to get things done. Definitely one of my favorite strains.”"
ScottysCallingMe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glass-apple/reviews/1412194,"“This is my first time trying Glass Apple. So far the prof is in the blunt. The aroma is light but smells like Granny Smith just cut apples up to make a pie. When I first lit it, I was experiencing the start of a headache. Now, about 20 minutes later I feel my headache dissipating and no longer feeling like I'm having a headache at all. I wish this was a lie, but I got more relief from Glass Apple than taking a pill. ...”"

The flower version of this really surprised me!  It does indeed smell just like a peeled green apple.  I tried the concentrate version of this strain way before trying the flower and I never really got that green apple flavor, it was always more of a pineapple, regardless both are delicious.  The buds are small but heavily trichomed and have a very comp...”"

Such a killer deal for great quality. Just as the description states it’s a subtle happy energetic functional high. Definitely recommend for adventures or daily activities. Wish this shit was legal in Texas already!!!!!”"

amburrell89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glass-apple/reviews/1554366,"“It's been consistently neutral to smoke in a joint, high has been a gradual climb over the first 20 minutes. 
The high itself isn't the worst, isn't the best. I get feelings of antsyness. I could easily see this being a great strain to smoke before any strenuous activity or workout. Hasn't been great for focus otherwise. 
Mild munchies after the high was gone and I've been left with a slightly put off feeling after e...”"
IslandManny,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glass-apple/reviews/1604964,"“I love this strain.  Whenever I’m in Colorado, I like to be active, hike, climb, ski, and spend time outside.  This strain is one that always leaves me feeling talkative, social, uplifted, and gives me one of the best highs of all sativa/sativa-dominant strains I’ve tried.  It’s always a must pick-up for me!  Especially from Native Roots out in the Highlands of Denver!”"
Thobail,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glass-apple/reviews/1743673,"“Great mind high, delivers a long lasting creative/playful mood while you get just a dash of munchies and energy boost. It's also quite the Afrodisiac. The only downside is the dry mouth.”"
