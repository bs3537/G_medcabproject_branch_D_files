Blue Rhino

justcarrie3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-rhino/reviews/1413270,"“I rate this strain so high because it does what I need it to do medically. Yes, the buzz is nice (often essential), but that's not why I take this strain. If I want to get baked I choose something specifically for that (ah, the variety of growing your own in addition to sampling what the collectives have...what a life!). BR allows me to be completely focused, lightly buzzed, incredibly creative and energetic. I usual...”"

With a "Haze" hangover, I find that this bud is best for early evening use. I would highly recommend this flower. Hope this helps fellow leafers.”"

Insurance hasn't kicked in yet so I'm having to wait to go to the doctors and someone had told me to try smoking some weed medicinally to help with the pain.

Kedehn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-rhino/reviews/1196253,"“I use this strain as my "gold standard" by which to rate all other strains. All around good high. You can get quiet and spacey, but the good far outweighs the bad. It's a classic. A "must buy" whenever I see it at my dispensary. 

A very uplifting, chatty, creative, long lasting high. Also good if you want to get stuff done around that house, though it's too potent for me to drive or do anything in public on. 

I'd g...”"
Heliosphan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-rhino/reviews/1360210,"“I enjoy this strain. The high is the best of both worlds. You feel focused enough for tasks that require cognitive resources, yet you feel uplifted. I was smoking other strains the night I tried this, but felt instantly higher when I added Blue Rhino to the equation.”"

Purple_Baphomet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-rhino/reviews/1373460,"“Blue Rhino is by far my favorite strain to grow as it performs strongly in all growth stages and produces perfect, swollen buds with minimal leaves (even a quick trim leaves the flowers in a beautifully photogenic state) and TONS of trichomes. Needs a lot of nutes but they finish flowering in about 8-9 weeks, and are best harvested when most of the trichomes have turned amber to really bring out the indica-dominant g...”"

This worked very well for that and helped with other things I deal with as well. The taste for me is very mild and pleasant. The smoke is nice and mellow and it is pretty heady at 21.77% THC.”"
Stevenspowersports,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-rhino/reviews/1309494,"“4/5
Blue Rhino's Skunk genetics show on this one, Dark leaves, light buds, hashy farty smell. Broken up reveals its blueberry tastes, background, and feeling: Body high with uplifting head boost. Taste can be a little better, and I found this strain isn't going to last the longest, but great for media lovers that want a good strain to enjoy their tunes or shows and not be put to sleep.”"

Yonex420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-rhino/reviews/1608676,"“This is one pretty impressive strain, especially for a Hybrid. The effects in its description were pretty much on point. Initially ur greeted with a gentle rush of euphoric energy, that helps u either focus on a task or just allow u to have a good time with friends. The Indica kicks in afterwards, where u feel so relaxed, cozy and ready to be in bed and let it lull you to sleep. 

Enjoy”"
