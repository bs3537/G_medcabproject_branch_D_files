The Big Dirty
=============
LuckyP,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-big-dirty/reviews/1439108,"“I'm about to flip my third round of the big dirty. Bred by Pruf Cultivar in Portland, Oregon. Lineage is Tangie x Girl Scout Cookies. The flowers have a slight purple hue, nice fat hard colas. The high is definitely a hybrid on the sativa side. Great for day time relaxation or for dropping anxiety levels. At higher doses it'll send you to bed too!!!”"
