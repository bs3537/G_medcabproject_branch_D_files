Pax 3 Vaped.

This strain had a wonderful earthy sweet taste that had a hint of lemon. 
First it was a nice mellow high and then it slowly went to another level. it was almost creeper in a sense that after about 15-30 min after vaping, it made things more vibrant and relaxing. Almost being in a Zen-like state, has an Enlightening feel. Great for gaming, socializing, and chilling.”"

Wish I could find flower. But am enjoying BHO *very* much. It's newer and not available widely. Hope it doesn't disappear too soon.”"

closetometal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shangri-la/reviews/1591158,"“This will definitely calm you down and mellow you out, but I wouldn't say its good for recreational use. The euphoric, happy effects are minimal and it tends to give me an unpleasant headache/heavy body feeling that lasts for even a day or two, which I don't usually experience with other strains.”"
