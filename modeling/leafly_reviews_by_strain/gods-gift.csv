DARTH_VAPOR,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gods-gift/reviews/1415126,"‚ÄúDon't mind that I'm sinking into my bed right now. Relaxing, and a fairly fuzzy brain right now...or I might just be getting tired. No energetic mind-racing effects. Pretty relaxing, vegging state right now. A movie sounds good. But the internet sounds good too. The internet is like a movie you can control. But it's also on average a more boring movie than watching an ACTUAL movie.‚Äù"
