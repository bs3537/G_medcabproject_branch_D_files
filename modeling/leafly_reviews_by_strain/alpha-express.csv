A bowl will hold you over for around 1-2 hours depending on the batch and the potency is usually in the high twenties. A great pick up!”"
DrFlower,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alpha-express/reviews/1342065,"“The Alpha Express from The Farm is one of the most unique Sativa strains that I have ever smoked. Its flavor is rich with vegetal notes of cocoa and coffee mixed with a spicy cedar flavor. The aroma has hints of cedar with a chemical-forward presence. The experience is cerebral, functional, and social.”"
PillowTalk,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alpha-express/reviews/1498266,"“Gave me a strong high that slowly kept increasing even when I thought it was done. Got super hungry too!”"
