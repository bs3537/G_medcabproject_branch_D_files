Dry eyes and a headband/goggle effect is a price worth paying, though over-indulgence may lead to some slight spin/vertigo sensation. Made me a little jumpy at first through a bong but settled into a smooth and relaxed high which also killed the leg spasms. Vaped through a volcano at 210 degrees C twice w...”"

DavM,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-kush/reviews/1380913,"“The smell and taste is to die for! Smells sweet, citrusy, and piney. The resin production is unreal. My fingers were very sticky after breaking up a little for a bowl. Awesome stuff!”"

ChefGreenThumbs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-kush/reviews/1386558,"“its a sativa dominant hybrid (70% sativa/30% indica) strain that is a potent cross between the insanely popular Jack Herer X OG Kush strains. This insanely dank bud boasts a moderately high THC level ranging from 13-22% on average and a myriad of extremely potent sativa and indica effects. Jack OG has an aroma of sweet candy with a hint of pungent skunk and a taste of sweet vanilla candy with a floral skunk aftertast...”"

wics2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-kush/reviews/1061584,"“A rather pleasant high. Now that I've smoked it a few times, I kinda like it's lazy effect - it's not enough to put me down, but it's enough to make me feel nice. Quite strong and very enjoyable, especially at night. If you can get your hands on this definitely try it.”"
Dabom702,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-kush/reviews/1399466,"“This has better pain control with less of the high that he has experienced with all other high CBD flowers he's tried. 

He had a headache at a 5, came down pretty quick to a 3 which is usual.  

Doesn't seem anxious.  
Not goofy like he's high.  
Seems to be concentrating on movie. 

He really likes it.”"

wics2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-kush/reviews/1061582,"“Very good bud to smoke at the end of a hard day of work. Not very good for work, though.  You definitely feel a little bit lazier than usual. Visual high is amazing, and good for some last minute sketching before sleeping.”"

Love OG Jack.. Great golden-green flowers that smell like heaven and taste even better. I found this strain to be great for low budget smokers like myself. If I smoked alittle in the morning with coffee/tea, I got a great daytime boost that kept the pain at bay, but did not couchlock. At night, if I smoked a little bit more.. I'd get relaxed and sleepy, sleeping the whole night. This strain, if ...”"

Hits like a sativa/kush but is quite forgiving - I didn't have to pause the session once. I have a high tolerance for Indicas as I have a fractured skull and c4 vertebrae, I think  that helped smooth out any uncomfortable effects that could.be experienced by this incredible strain. My first time with Jack and I'm in love with the euphori...”"
