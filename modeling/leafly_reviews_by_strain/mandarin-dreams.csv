Smokebrake,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mandarin-dreams/reviews/1799436,"“I’m no professional bud connoisseur but this indica strain is wonderful and extremely heavy. Heavy in a euphoric “where the hell am I?” kind of way! It made me paranoid and anxious but I am a lightweight/newbie and I think I smoked too much. I don’t feel any pain from my headaches or body aches. It put me to sleep.”"
