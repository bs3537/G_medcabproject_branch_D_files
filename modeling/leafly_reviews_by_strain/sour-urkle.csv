Sour Urkle
=============
BunnyBear420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1409862,"“One of the most flavorful hybrids i have tried so far and i have had my fair share of hybrids. Nice relaxing body high,  easy head high,  but effects last only about 30 minutes or so for the veteran user. I would recommend for beginners.”"
slackvana,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1382161,"“hybrid (felt more like a sativa dominate to me): Indica - nice body high. Sativa - anxiety and a mind that won't quit. Not always a bad thing, but no good for my dreams.”"
ThisOneTimeAtUmass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1479080,"“Surprisingly potent hybrid. Time loss is likely. Really solid head and body highs with trailers at higher doses. No fatigue and not racey, may be the best balanced strain I've tried. The aroma and flavor is an odd but decent mix of grape and diesel with earthy floral notes. Some reviewers report short highs, like a Trainwreck up and down. This was not the case for me. I've been a regular consumer for thirty years and...”"
azmiked,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1413885,"“As a veteran smoker and a fan of pure strains, this hybrid was very pleasing. Substituting this for a sativa did not disappoint as it has most the characteristics desired. From the pipe I got good and high, feelin' groovy and able to function normally. A few rips from the bong and it's another story. That got me very stoned, almost catatonic. Be warned, it's strong! This one I'd get again a fan favorite. Thanks TCC f...”"

sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1652038,"“Good late night strain that tastes like grapes and soil. From the soil in WA has a cut that’s what’s up. My eyes are bone dry. Mind and body couch locked. Good happy heavy vibe.”"
mcg592s,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1651155,"“Amazing smell and smoke. Great relaxed high. The mental creativity is great too. Just wish high lasted a little longer. I’d say 1-2 hours max depending on how much you’ve smoked. I am a daily smoker with a high tolerance and the first time I  smoked 2 bongs of this it rocked me within minutes. Great strain if you want a indica heavy high”"
tjasper28,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1528139,"“Love this strain! I like sour diesel it’s a great sativa, so this is no let down. You feel affects as soon as you inhale! The taste is great!”"
allinlinden,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1224494,"“Beautiful tasty strain! Tastes like candy! Great hybrid effects! The Sour Diesel provides a euphoric head high and the Purple Urkle gives a great body high! Great Bud All Around!”"
carterkush092,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1670377,"“Amazing looking strain! Light green with hints of purple sprouting up through each bud; long orange hairs looking like Ron Weasley, with crystals covering each night like you’re gazing at a night sky full of stars. Delicious berry taste, a top tier in my opinion if you like fruity tasting strains. Superb body n head high mixture, though it feels like it leans more on the Indica side. It’s a heavy hitter that’ll make ...”"
t8_xo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1667221,"“i had this strain when i started up smoking again and i was gone for a couple days. sure i smoked over five moderate sized bowls, but i really liked it. i would do this again. it gave my mind such a rush that i feel like i probably exploded. the long-lasting effects, however, did not agree with me. it was a massive hangover. still would do it again.”"
darthkevin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1255083,"“Nice smelling flowers. Great taste...very green tasting. The taste lingers in the mouth. Seems to be cutting down my pain. I would recommend this bud to anyone looking to be in couch lock at night.”"

AZJH16,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1362732,"“This strain smells amazing and has great therapeutic effects. I find the high to similar to other robust hybrids. Mood elevation & hunger on the top as far as effects. Overall this is a TASTY strain that I will definitely keep an eye out for in the future. A+++++”"

orgncwhtmlk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1213886,"“On point with the description! Dense buds all .4-.9 grams. Lighter green color with yellower orange hairs. Real frosty (23%thc), the smell is a small kick of pungent goodness. haha It's a wonderful aroma really! The smoke is very smooth imo. Not much for taste going in, but coming out you had that light airy fruity somewhat pungent taste. I don't want to say it was that of your S.D. kinda pungent but similar. It was ...”"

Shadowforcenick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1378047,"“I've always thought of sour urkel as sour diesels little brother. It carries that gas taste while having overall maintaining a light taste composition.  Not to overpowering, but plenty of flavor to notice other than ash. My batch looked pretty good, mostly green in color. Great smell! I ended up rolling most of the bud into joints and that is still my favorite way so smoke diesel strains.”"

RizzleDizzle420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1260691,"“Great strain for relaxing and getting a full head to toe body buzz. I'd say I feel more of the indica genes rather than the sativa in this one.”"

Squatchmo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1269049,"“Oh my, what a wonderful balance between a spicy berry and standard diesel flavor (smells like diesel too). Sour Urkle hits me HARD and it's one of the few strains that truly screams "hybrid" to me. It stimulates appetite, it promotes sleep, it gives energy, it initiates introspection, it makes you crave social interaction, it's got it all. One of my favorites after the first taste,”"
yoshiya,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1272566,"“High :) 
THIS STRAIN CAN LOOK VERYVERYVERY DIFF ALL IN THE SAME BATCH, WHICH I LOVE!! THE TASTE CAN VERY, I TYPICALLY MIX THIS W A NT X MIX.  IT'S WORTH A TRY :)”"
CicoBuff,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1420156,"“Yeah, this strain does it all. It's heavy while being light. It's energizing while being relaxing. It's a really nice strain, but can feel a bit powerful, so it may be better to take small tokes if smoking, or lower dosed edibles if ingesting, because this stuff is strong.”"

getoverit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-urkle/reviews/1237300,"“Excellent strain.  Leans toward the sativa side of a hybrid.  Nice smooth taste, nothing too harsh.  After just a few hits I was ready to take on the day.  I really enjoyed how uplifting it made me feel.   I would highly recommend this strain for social time with friends or for getting some serious "around the house" work done.  Very nice.”"
