Very uplifting and easy going, it's perfect for a pick me up. Smells insane, very tropical and spicy, with some ammonia and citrus undertones. Tastes spicy.”"
DankNunuFresh,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/full-moon/reviews/1331346,"“Tried this strain for the first time the other day. Let me tell you how warm and comfortable I felt in 3 mins top. I got by usual warm vibration feeling almost instantly after smoking it, and that makes me happy. I highly recommend it :)”"
DankMariJuana,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/full-moon/reviews/1435888,"“My favorite sativa so far. Felt focused, uplifted, energized, motivated; great daytime smoke. Strong head high. Maybe sliiiiiight visual effect in the way of everything being beautiful somehow. Wish it was available in Oregon PDX area consistently. Looks like Nirvana Seeds discontinued selling seeds of it too :(”"

Those who are old enough to remember that Thai Stick that was around during the late 70's early 80's. well here it is. Full moon reminded me of just that. nice spicy, earthy,  slightly lemon.

Other times, it's spacey and surreal. Sometimes objects and structures star bending in weird ways. But the high itself has always been good. If your a fan of Sativas and psychedelics, this is a must try. <3 Has a crazy smell as well. Sweet and tropical as you would expect.”"
amart115,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/full-moon/reviews/1352864,"“This strain was positively wavy. I smoked this strain, and I was sure that the bud was not getting me high, rather the blunt was. After 30 minutes, I began to hallucinate, impairing my driving vision significantly. The sunrays were bending, and I couldn't stop smiling. What an elite day time smoke! Stay lifted (:>)”"

 done around the house.”"

JoshCarlton,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/full-moon/reviews/1671760,"“Everything, from the bud structure to the fragrant sweet floral smell with a strong herbal spiciness, yell pure sativa. But the effects are where it really reveals itself in its full glory - an intense, soaring head high born aloft by a sense of euphoria which wells up from deep within and contaminates your entire being with an infectious joyfulness. And the trippiness is there too - at times, the vast mental space o...”"
