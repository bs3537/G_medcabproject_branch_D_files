Peppery citrus and spicy Taste and smell 

Uplifting head buzz, that moves to the body slightly. Positive upbeat feeling, zero paranoia.

Solid strain. Enjoyed every minute, growing and vaping this plant.”"

Auto flower only took 6 weeks from seed to harvest and harvested 31 grams of high grade bud was amazed over such a small amount of time. The smoke is nice not overpowering I rate the high 4/5 due to the odd taste. Overall very good grow for any first timers like myself :)”"
