More on the energizing rather than couch lock side of the strain for me but my elderly parents use it in cookies for better sleep.  A big dose is quite psychoactive and will mess with your head but I'm not Mr. PotNerd to tell you how it compares with other strains, it's certainly plenty functional enough for shamanic explorations.
