KeithKatcha,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/magnum/reviews/1344104,"“Very potent sativa effects, very energetic high, not ideal for chilling with a film as I find it hard to stay sat down I just want to be more active. Definitely a fun weed for the daytime with friends but on my own I would pick another strain that makes me a little less hyper. 
I would describe this as a 'party' strain!”"
DrArsenic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/magnum/reviews/1392082,"“Magnum is one of my favorite autoflowering strains.  I agree with the time to harvest, 77+ days.  Such a nice spice and citrus taste and an elevating buzz.  Using 50/50 compost and vermiculite and garden store nutes I have been getting about 100g/plant - pretty new at this.  
Believe the potency reports!  Just got results back from Steep Hill on a representative sample of my last Magnum grow.  24.33% as THC-A, that c...”"

camponelli4ganja,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/magnum/reviews/1324508,"“The high was fun, starting with a period of losing time for about an hour and forgetting how to talk or walk. Then it was an energizing, uplifting effect for a few hours. The taste was great, kind of peppery. Only down side is the auto strain doesn't grow much and I get 4 to 10 grams per harvested plant. So it is an exotic that I break out from time to time but stick with growing the big boys for more yield and daily...”"

SpinozaBR,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/magnum/reviews/1286847,"“Very good strain. It's woody, spicy, a very good smell and flavor. I called friends to smoke it together, everyone loved it, we stood for minutes only laughing. I would recommend its smoke for going out, having fun, you definitely will not want to stay at the same place while smoking this.

However after a couple of grams during the the day, you'll notice the cdb, very relaxing and anti anxiety strain. 
Nice to plant...”"
Evenray,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/magnum/reviews/1281187,"“Tuo asunto numero 5. olisi todella juuri sellainen kun etsin.  Erityisen tärkeitä ovat oma terassi ja puutarha, meren läheisyys , wifi, hyvät julkiset kulkuyhteydet ja ennen kaikkea se, ettei asunnossa ole ollut kosteusvauriota ja/tai hometta.

Ilmoituksen mukaan asunto ei kuitenkaan ole vapaana talveksi, jolloin sitä tarvitsen. Tarvitsen asunnon syyskuun - lokakuun alusta lähtien aina touko - kesäkuuhun saakka. (Rii...”"
ComaByKittens,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/magnum/reviews/1310193,"“Pretty "dope." Basically, the effects were: chill, but not couch lock chilled, but you're definitely still a potato. Herb had an inner commentary running in my mind with a detached, laid back sense of amusement. Little time warpy. I would say this is a good evening smoke- you can still function but your eyes are going to get droopy and your mind might start to get loopy- more in the mad hatter variety. Yet, strangely...”"
sarcaviol,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/magnum/reviews/1313629,"“Absolutely underrated five star sativa dominant hybrid! You can feel sative effects from beginning to end, at the end you can feel a little bit indica effects. Totaly clear, talkative, energetic high. I really love it.”"

CannabisExpert,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/magnum/reviews/1683727,"“I found Magnum to be more like a chronic type herb. Very relaxing, and it will get you through the day. If you're going to buy regular, you might as well put in a little bit more and by this strain. I usually combine high quality medicinal buds and alternate between those and a more regular type strain like this one. Magnum is good for a mid-gade bud.”"
