I usually smoke bongs, but I felt it only proper to smoke in true beast mode style. blunts. few puffs in it felt as if syrup was being poured over my brain. a wave of relaxation washed over me moving from my head, downward. it is a fitting name indeed.”"

The effects resembled it's OG Kush parentage mostly with a very floaty and dreamy body experience.

I really all over the place mentally and unable to pay attention. I will give this strain another try but will just go to bed immediately after toking.”"
DaBinx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/beast-mode-20/reviews/1265171,"“Solid strain. Great presentation. Holds true to its Master Kush roots with a slight funk of the Wifi. I seem to taste a bit of a chocolate as well. Overall its strong, funtional, and medicating.”"
dayrock253,https://www.leafly.com/indica/beast-mode-20/reviews/1167625,"“Over rated strain. Taste is eh, smell is good, high just isn't there like I would expect. Seahawks fans gotta try it but don't hold your breath buy some bubba instead”"
ColoradoParanoidPain,https://www.leafly.com/indica/beast-mode-20/reviews/1427694,"“Brain relaxed, slight warm feeling in the chest. Easy to lay down and relax, back pain gone.  Little foggy headed at peak of high. Slight happy euphoria. Great stuff. Oh and where I'm at it's called Blue fire OG It is like a nice blue fire is running through my nervous system.”"
