Has that terrific Jack Herer smell that's oh so wonderful along with a subtle hint of lemon. Smoke was smooth and relaxing followed by a nice energetic high.”"
Bearsa,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kaboom/reviews/1417326,"“One of my preferred strains for hiking and outdoors, although somewhat too potent in effects for dangerous or hazardous climbs, but if it's limited to a camp site or flat mesa, this is my preferred strain for the outdoors feeling.
The effects provide much energy and motivation, although the later effects around the 2 hour mark were followed by slight paranoia.”"

Got it from Urban Greenhouse in PhX AZ & I woke up agitated and in pain and after a raw cone joint of this strain and I'm very happy and 70% relieved of my usual morning aches. Not too stony very much a sativa. It's all very pungent so no sneak a tokes with this one. For a veteran smoker I'll give it bomb ass 5 because I hate sativas but she made me a believer.”"

First time I smoked it got 2 puffs in and it hit me like a ton of bricks, had to put that joint out halfway through. Everytime I've smoked it since it never ceases to amaze how quickly and powerfully it hits you. Wicked good sativa rush that was just awesome in every way.

I've tried lots of different combinations of things but nothing seemed to work. Even when I did want it, the ability to finish was noooot possible.

After recovering from. gut surgeries I was left with a lot of pain. With the help of this strain, I was able to walk away from oxycodone without a hitch. By just smoking ( or vaping ) a little in the morning, I can start my day relatively pain free. Not to mention the fact that I turn into a downri...”"

Fast creative sativa high. Mildly trippy but in a good way. Great for stress relief and working either physically or writing and accounting. Great college student and professional medication.”"
cgwinn1985,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kaboom/reviews/1363914,"“Very relaxing Day strain. It tastes like pine needles though, which I am not too keen on. Makes me feel creative and relaxed, but not too relaxed. Makes me kind of chatty too.”"

Its very energetic, clear headed and didn't give me a racy heart or anxious feeling at all.  I'm the type that overthinks when I smoke but not from this.

Possibly different phenotype than most reviewers as I got a more earthy taste out of it, but as for the high, the name certainly describes it. A few puffs of a pipe and Kaboom, I'm high AF and focused . And I normally take dabs all day. Potent stuff.”"
