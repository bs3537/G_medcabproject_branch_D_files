A taste similar to the smell that vaporizes to a thick vapor that isn't too rough, but coats your mouth. The taste alone has me coming back, but this strain is a complete package. A slightly energetic and euphoric high slowly kicks in and leads to a sense of comfort and relaxation, but this strain definitely show...”"

Don't get me wrong, I like Jack. However, the strain causes my chronic pain to worsen so it's a no bueno for me. Strawberry sequoia, on the other hand, is marvelous!!! Incredibly uplifting. Helps me to get motivated and moving so I can be productive and focused without the exacerbated pain.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sequoia-strawberry/reviews/1517421,"“PHENOMENAL SATIVA
It doesn't give me such an energetic buzz as it helps me get motivated.... hard to explain. That taste is amazing in concentrate form. I'm glad I got the highest tier available for this strain, it tastes like Strawberry's n cream. Lasted about 3 hours. Doesn't flare up any anxiety, gives me nothing but optimism and smiles.”"

Let me start off by saying I normally couldn't care less about the taste of a strain as long as it's effects are taking care of my medical issues. But the way this tastes is amazing, definite strawberry taste came thru in the shatter I got.
It helped me get all my chores done and gave me great motivation”"

I’m not getting any of the negative side effects. So I’m not sure who label the dizzy and the paranoia. I’m feeling good.”"

LadyElsa,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sequoia-strawberry/reviews/1473542,"“As a chronic fatigue sufferer, I was really excited to try this supposedly high-energy strain. I was disappointed in that regard. It is a great strain for daytime smoking if you’re just going to chill, but it didn’t motivate me to do anything.

The reason I still gave this strain 4 stars is because it is the best smelling weed I have ever smoked. It has an amazing strawberry aroma that I just can’t get enough of!”"

stanleygold1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sequoia-strawberry/reviews/1412884,"“Best daytime strain that I have ever smoked. Doesn't make you feel "high" in the mind but relaxes the body's stress. I also find it to be motivating. It also reduces my PTSD. Not a prudent bedtime choice as it might be hard to still the body. Take this strain seriously. If we all buy it, the dispensaries will follow. I have the best dispensary around and this is now a normal choice. If your serious about your pot, an...”"
