I can tell you this Indica especially will bring you intense relaxation, a sweet body high with very calming mental effects. The strain I bought was 27.6% THC, For reference. Most Indica do not hit me as hard as the blues. Hardly felt the 1st four hits but it was the 5th that it all intensely kicked in. Definitely recommended for anyone with insomnia, stress, depression ...”"

Had to stop on my 5th rip only cause I felt to high.. I don't know how else to explain it, it's almost like I didn't feel the first 4 rips until the fifth one.”"

BvanPDX,https://www.leafly.com/indica/whitaker-blues/reviews/1213556,"“I want to like this strain more and will try again because it is such a great bed time, or anxiety controller indica. The strain I currently have lacks the taste and smell I was hoping for.  should I find the farm that gets this one tasting more citrusy I could see it being a 4 star strain for me.”"
