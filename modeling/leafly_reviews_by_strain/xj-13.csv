XJ-13
=============
killionstrains,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/xj-13/reviews/1417835,"“When I open the jar to smell this XJ-13 it's almost as if little angels carrying baskets of citrus fruits are swirling past me, while a single pine tree stands center of the jar filled with peppermints, all the while a clan of gnomes lay below harvesting honey from the bee hives atop the pine tree... You get the picture.”"
bleh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/xj-13/reviews/1415930,"“My absolute favorite strain on the planet in terms of coping with my anxiety and depression. Makes me uplifted, energetic, happy, creative, etc. Perfect for smoking with friends and for going out. I got this from my dealer before I had turned 18 and got my recommendation and now try to go to collectives that carry it so I can use it over and over again. I love this strain, it never gets old. Everyone needs to try it.”"
