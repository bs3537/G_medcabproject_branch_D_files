I would not recommend this strain for doing anything that requires memory or focus however its the perfect strain for unleashing your creativity.
This strain is great for artists or musicians who are interested in getting lost in their artform. 

While it is an uplifting sativa, it might not be the best for social interactions. You might find yourself losing your tr...”"

raginboston,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega-dawg/reviews/1344741,"“Great indica for nausea and suppressed appetite, mellow without ever really hitting the gas pedal.  This has much more medicinal value than euphoric or happy, though it does certainly help with both.  Very happy trying it out, and at least keeping some on hand.”"
SeatownHaze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega-dawg/reviews/1394159,"“Had a bad migraine ten minutes before smoking this and this shit killed the headache off quick. Deep, relaxed feeling, almost hazy, like your body is paralyzed while your mind floats in the clouds. Very nice stuff.”"
MTK421,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega-dawg/reviews/1338494,"“I would say that this is a pretty good strain. Good taste, smell. Smells fruity but doesnt seem like grape but is more berry smell and flavor. Has other smells I cant quite make out. Bought an ounce of this stuff and made some good cannabutter and cookies with this stuff. Great balanced high. Would say that it isnt top shelf”"

cascadianpatriot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega-dawg/reviews/1210733,"“I had a 24% THC batch that was pretty lackluster. Hybrids are becoming favorites, but this one, despite the high THC didn't really deliver. Wonderful aroma, but kind of a harsh smoke that didn't leave much of a balanced high.  I kept thinking it was a creeper, but nothing ever kicked in.”"
