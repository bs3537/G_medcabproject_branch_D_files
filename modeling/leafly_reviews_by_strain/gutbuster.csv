WolfKnuckle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gutbuster/reviews/1303262,"“I find it very sweet, very different taste, kinda berry but not too sweet? More of a charcoal bitter chocolate? Gave me some anxiety for the first 30 minutes, not strong more paranoid? Overall I think it's a great strain, giggly for sure!”"

Jetlife631,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gutbuster/reviews/1780542,"“One of the nicest looking and best tasting strains I've ever had. I am a Pax3 guy and this strain at 380 is heaven. Very Terpy and as others have said has a unique and distinct vanilla, chocolate taste with berry undertones. I use it before going to the gym in the morning. It's a very balanced high. Very creative cerebral high when you peak on Gutbuster. I wonder if whoever named this strain realized the value it had...”"

Sensei-Sala,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gutbuster/reviews/1692632,"“Gutbuster #1 is a heavy hitting indica that brings both calmness to the entire body and head.  Very sweet and flavorful undertones of a berry variety.  This strain, in my opinion, is best consumed after a long-stressful day of strenuous activity.  Medical symptoms that can be helped are anxiety, severe pain and in some cases depression.”"
