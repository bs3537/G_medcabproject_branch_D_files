Cactus
=============
rkowna,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cactus/reviews/1417003,"“This is truly an all star pain strain.  One of the few strains that provides full body pain relief with adjustable effects. 

For me indicas are night time only.  In fact, I am usually one step further; nighttime after I have absolutely no chance of having to do anything else.  

This is where Cactus rises above other indicas and hybrids.  In fact Cactus shines.  If I vape just a couple of long hits I can smoke this ...”"

This bad boy tests at 36.61%, and is a standard at Dockside.  The grower they get it from has even won an award for it!

HippoCommander,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cactus/reviews/1387529,"“Nice inhale with a little bit of grapefruit and earthy notes, high is pleasant and upbeat yet sedative. Felt great on the way back down too. Smoke it too heavily and you'll get sleepy, but if you need some sleep this ought to do the job.”"
YUNGN8,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cactus/reviews/1390240,"“I have never written a review before but I felt it was necessary for this strain because I'm in love. I have pretty bad anxiety and this completely wiped that out. My body feels amazing and I was even able to read a book and think about deeply. This is a great before bed strain too as I find it easy to turn off the wandering thoughts.”"

piddlegoose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cactus/reviews/1384034,"“Opening the jar of this strain instantly reminded me of one of my favorite genetics, Dutch Treat. The smoke from this strain was very mellow and citrusy tasting. within 20 minutes I was blanketed with a warm body high that curbed some back pain that I was dealing with. I would recommend this strain as a great evening smoke as it made me very relaxed and a bit sleepy.”"
Groovn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cactus/reviews/1391930,"“Wow... As for me, this strain gets a standing ovation 👏 👏 👏 After 30 years of chronic use, I have an EXTREMELY high tolerance, and have a hard time getting truly high.

Trikomi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cactus/reviews/1387532,"“Gave 9 because it relieves migraines so well. Smell is haze like. Mellow smoke. Don't hit much to body. More like calms your brain activity. One hour after you begin to loose focus and start to forget what you are speaking. It wear of nicely. Makes you feel lazy but not tired, if you smoke more it gives focus and energy. Middle day smoke.

Yea, you feel like you have haze in head.”"

1GoodMoo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cactus/reviews/1387163,"“Sneaky strain, comes on very slow and subtle.  Stacks tremendously with multiple doses so be wary.  Modest pain relief (from a chronic illness standpoint so it might do very well for some).   Managed to keep my wits about me and remain functional despite being way stupid high - a very rare thing. 
Def. getting more again.”"
BiggieJ,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cactus/reviews/1419528,"“any strain with Northern Lights in the lineage has my attention. and with the second parent being the landrace Aghani strain, you are in for one hell of a treat. the smells are deep and long lasting and the relief from stress and pain is almost immediate. A large variety of patients will benefit greatly from Cactus strain.”"
