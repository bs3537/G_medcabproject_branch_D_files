QGQUE,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-cookies/reviews/1413168,"“Pink Cookies is a extreme rarity! it isn't pink, it's not the best fragrance and it isn't the worst. Pink Cookies texture is a comfortable chunky with semi-rich earth tone colors and a floral, earth, exotic fruit aroma before being lit. After lighting the Pink Cookies, the aroma shifts to a deep sensual earth fragrance with the effects being in the 90% range of euphoria (mental) with calm, focused, sociable, self-enl...”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-cookies/reviews/1379499,"“Really enjoy Pink Cookies... it's a "fuck you up" strain, but it isn't too heavy. Probably you won't want to do a crossword or wire a circuit board, but chatting and gaming will definitely be enhanced. My suggestion... Pink Cookies, PS4, and snacks.”"

Did that really happen? That's what you're in store for. Well at least I was.

Seriously can't stress and I'll go full Obi Wan here and say do not under estimate the power of this strain. Especially vaping. You'll feel it take hold after the first 2 pulls an...”"

Wedding cake is a good other name for this strain because she is best waifu of weed. Northwest Cannabis Solutions knocked it out of the galaxy with this. Every time i run out of weed I buy this. Even when I want to try other strains, I get a gram at least of Pink. 

Long lasting body effects gives this strain a huge longevity of high. You peak early, but then you settle i...”"

Great hybrid. The oil taste more slightly sweet earth, spice and citrus. Smokey peet moss, grapefruit, chai tea and black pepper. This strain needs a better name, it’s off putting to amateurs that it doesn’t taste like cake or cookies at all. I’ve seen pink cookies more often than wedding cake b...”"

Like a creamy over growth of eucalyptus with exotic wood and a hint of grapes. I can’t stop enjoying the aroma. Taste is the aroma extremely amplified. Relaxed, euphoric, creative, uplifting.

One of the few indicas I've tried that makes you feel both high and stoned at the same time. Meditative and mentally relaxing with a touch of creativity and introspection mixed with some body melt.. yes please. I think in the future any indica dominant with GSC genetics will be a baseline for fabulous phenotypes and crosses to come”"

Classic cookie buds, pretty small but dense as a rock and louder than your grandma trying to wake you up for church! Very potent indica, had me walking around around like a blissed out zombie.

This strain smokes smooth with a sweet and peppery aftertaste that gives you that good lung expansion feeling in your lungs.
