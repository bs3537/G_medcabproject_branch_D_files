Pineapple Kush
=============
Nileuphoria,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-kush/reviews/1410915,"“Prep @ 16:20, smokes amazing. Really nice aroma, flavor is quite intense, very dense buds, I'd say Pinapple Kush is definitely more of a head high than it is body, being a Sativa dominant I expected such. Was surprised and quite happy to find that about 15 min later I realized that I was both up, completely worry/care free, giddy and happy. The body high also allowed me to feel quite relaxed at the same time. Intense...”"

I've found this to be the most effective strain for managing my chronic pain and epilepsy. I didn't have any seizures when I was smoking this, which was quite impressive. Most strains don't take away my pain completely, but significantly help and this was the one that took it away. My anxiety wasn't ...”"

May make you want to close your eyes, but not to sleep--just to thoroughly relax into the even, fabulous high. What's more, I don't experience that back-side-of-the-high fatigue I sometimes get with other strains. Terrific for stress, anxiety, and mood elevation. Excellent grass! Really love the high!”"

Beautifully dense, colorful buds with long orange hairs and a pungent citrus blast. The flavors of pineapple come through quite strong with the subtlety of the Master Kush; giving it an interesting aroma, almost minty. It feels like a sativa with a blissful and clear headed buzz and a slow creeping body high that follows. Highly recommend this...”"

Instantly blasts you off into outer space and then gently brings you back down like a parachute slowly floating back to the beautiful blue earth. Lasts 4-6 hours and has calming after effects that can last well into the next day.”"

dakotakush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-kush/reviews/1311643,"“this strain isn't a potent one.  nugs are compact and looks coated in cobwebs. hard to break down too. smells like the outerside of a batch of pineapples and something else. high is decent. leaves you happy, sorta talkative, but it really helps put you to sleep. helps with pain a little as well.”"

xDOWNSOUTHx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-kush/reviews/1133376,"“Pineapple Kush from HSO has been a great smoke to help with my PTSD. This strain grows very nicely with an average flower time. Late flower will produce an amazing sweet smell on the plant and nice production of trichomes. Effect is mellow with creativity and relaxation. Great for daytime and night for sleep.”"
DrSpacemonk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-kush/reviews/1133375,"“Great, fruity taste. It's a real shame to smoke this with papers. Ruins the pineapple flavor. 
The high is really heavy. Definitely feels like an indica. Bought an 1/8th and was not disappointed.”"

I couldn't stop thinking about food, even though I had JUST eaten lunch. I knew I wasn't hungry, but kept asking everyone what they wanted for dinner. Then I made a big bowl of ice cream, wrestled with myself and managed to put it back! I will never use this strain again.”"
mackingHangin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-kush/reviews/1235055,"“Pineapple Kush is a decent strain. Good fruity yet earthy smell to it. Don't particularly care for the appearance though. Personally prefer more orange and purple hairs. Definitely a  head high though. Right behind the nose. Really energetic and up high but a terrible come down. Feel real sluggish and sleepy when I'm coming down. Great aroma and high though. Only downside is the come down.”"
