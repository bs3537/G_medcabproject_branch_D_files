Romptoast,https://www.leafly.com/indica/everlast/reviews/1181742,"“Better than the average strain. The high was pretty good, very indica type high that just put me to bed. The skunky taste wasn't the best, as I usually go for more sweet strains, but it was very strong smelling and THC content was VERY HIGH. Not for beginners.”"

staylyfted,https://www.leafly.com/indica/everlast/reviews/1183087,"“tried a pre-roll of this strain and it is very nice! definitely a night time smoke (couch lock will definitely happen). Pretty heavy body high and you feel it within minutes and lasted a few hours. Perfect for a lazy movie/gaming night, or cooling out and listening to some good tunes. this is a strain that myself personally could only smoke alone though as it made me a bit paranoid. would and probably will purchase a...”"
