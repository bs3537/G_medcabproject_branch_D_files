This is a very powerful indica, its dankness can be smelt across the room once the jar opens, its unique nose is easily picked out in a room full of kushes, the buzz is very narcotic and is excellent for pain and insomnia, I wouldn't recommend smoking this if you plan on getting things done, it will lock you into the couch in 3.2 seconds.

The perfect combination of body stone, euphoric sensation and stimulated imagination. Delicious classic kush flavour with earthy undertones, maybe even a little Diesel when vaped. VERY dank weed, keep in a smell proof container. If you love your Kush, this one is a must try.”"

Pretty average strain in my opinion.”"
