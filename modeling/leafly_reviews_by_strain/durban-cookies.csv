My medical issues come from multiple surgeries including back & neck and symptoms of Lupus that can leave me spacey & depressed. 

Now! About Durban Cookies:
I knew I liked Durban Poison so I figured this would be about the same. Boy, was I wrong! The pain reduction in my neck and back is wonderful. Not gone, but muted enough to concentrate on something else. That’s g...”"

Definitely now one of my favorite strains to smoke after a bad mental health day. Took my horrible mood and made me significantly happier in the matter of a couple hits. As for my Tourette’s, it also helped a lot but I did tic a couple times; didn’t phase me though. Personally I’d recommend this strain to anyone with an anxiety disorder or mood disorder beca...”"

rusquiddinme,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/durban-cookies/reviews/1681577,"“I enjoyed via dab. I think the most balanced high as of late. My head, face, eyelids, and forehead feel amazing. My neck feels great where it’s resting on the couch. I could float there, but there’s something keeping me engaged with what i want to do. Despite contentment, I had the energy to spring up and go pick up a tasty drink and cold water from the 7 Eleven. Some sativas can be equally debilitating as indicas; t...”"

Its a high energy, but not one that is jumpy. Great for social interactions too. Minimal body effects (slight sensation in the legs), but mostly a clear head high. And little to no dry mouth.

I'm new to MMJ & opted for some sativa gummy bears which did me awful. I actually ran back in when I realized that I didn't get a gram of this to try.

This will be my mid afternoon replacement for high caffeine ...”"
