LizZaBea21,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/deadlights/reviews/1739841,"“I was very sick and on 3 prescriptions for nausea and abdominal pain. I was still living in hell with them. My local dispensary recommended Dead Lights and as soon as I smoked it I immediately started to feel relief. That day was the first day I ate and didn’t get sick in over a week. This strain is a life changer”"

I absolutely love this strain, lives up to the claims. Fantastic for pain and muscle discomfort, extremely relaxing.
It has a bit of "sleepy" for me, so it's good for when I don't have to be fully functioning.”"

My first time trying a CBD strain and I am very pleased with the results. I would recommend this for others with muscle spasms and overall pain, anxiety, or sleeplessness.”"

It relieved a LOT of my pain so I could get some sleep... Now I buy it by the ounce 🤗... Highly recommend for us elderly with arthritis”"
