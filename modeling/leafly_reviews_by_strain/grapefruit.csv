Grapefruit
=============
PieRomania,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1417901,"“I had obtained Grapefruit from my provider due to them not having my usual strains in stock a few months back. Their lineup is all outstanding, so I was more than content trying something new.
Upon getting home and opening the bag, I was overwhelmed with a strong, bitter citrus aroma that was obviously the cause for it's name. Mouthwatering and almost beckons you to bring your nose closer again for multiple whiffs.

ProphetofJah,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1417910,"“This aromatic sativa has a citrusy taste and scent with a nice full yet energetic high.  Light colas with more orange hairs than a Irish orphanage.  Great for daytime hiking, biking, surfing, gardening, housecleaning, and goes good with morning coffee even as part of a daily nutritional breakfast.”"
PennsylvaniaPaul,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1417430,"“Grapefruit is a phenomenal strain for my PTSD. As a Marine veteran I hardly used cannabis pre enlistment, but after treating my ptsd related anxiety for years with alcohol I was desperate to find a change. The multiple meds the VA gave me took me on one of the worst emotional roller coaster rides of my life then I found the grapefruit strain. This strain proved stereotypes wrong. I could function without  couch lock ...”"
cpt.kush,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1413637,"“In one word, Grapefruit could be described as HEADY. 
This wonderfully citrus-sweet Sativa has an palate that is very unique to the strain; I could easily pick it out in a blind taste-test. It leaves behind the taste of a sharp citrus fruit with hints of a sweet almost candy-like flavor. The yield was better than I had expected, with nice light green colas that were large in size, and nice and dense too. I recommend ...”"
heavens_2_betsey,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1349603,"“I absolutely love this strain. I suffer from debilatating anxiety. I have been staying away from sativas, scared for any extra energy. We had a vendor bring in a sample and I tried it before I did any research on the strain. I FELT AMAZING!! I wanted to dance!! I give this bud a 9 across the board, Taste, smell, effects....AWESOME!! I was shocked when I found out it was a pure Sativa...One of my new favorite strains....”"
EmeraldCityGreen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1376016,"“A sweet hitting, citrusy and uplifting strain that gets you talking and induces a sociable, happy and giggly high. Won't put you to sleep, but helps a lot with pain or soreness. Can begin to make lighter smokers paranoid if you overdo it. A good wake and Bake smoke.”"
SallyRabies,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1378192,"“Pleasant strain that didn't totally strip me of my mental faculties. Sedating, but didn't make me lethargic. Felt a general sense of well-being. Suppressed my nausea and made me a little hungry (so the tug to eat is there, but not overwhelming). Overall, pretty decent.”"
GettinHighSince95,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1378197,"“Heady! Very uplifting and energetic. Might be a little strong for people who do not smoke daily. Great work strain for the grind if you can handle it. Smells just like a yellow grapefruit,  amazingly similar.  Taste kinda sour but also sweet at the same time. Very tasty. I'm literally going back for more as soon as I'm done with this review!!!”"
sativalover,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1378196,"“This is a great strain.  it has a high sativa % and is loaded with crystals and smells just like a grapefruit. its one of my fav daytimes and you still can smoke small amounts in the evening and still have a somewhat chilled buzzz.”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1279728,"“Oooh, exceptional come on. It’s all smooth and rich with a genuinely happy mood elevation that so floods you with positivity, you can’t help but smile. Things have an “off” cinematic quality...like you’re placed on set of good movie. The dominant mental vibe is a bursting euphoria that’s now seamlessly meshing with physical bursts of tingles all over the body. Almost equally strong feelings of having “fun”! Which mak...”"
errzy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1378201,"“This is a sativa strain that will make both the connoisseur, and new-comers a good experience.

You can definitely smell why they called it grapefruit; thankfully I love it. 

Only a few hits (based on tolerance) I could start feeling the effects. It was a very active and pleasant experience .  

In my opinion one of the best qualities for those whom feel uncomfortable talking to other people, or heck, even strangers...”"
Tubtub,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1378199,"“Just smoked a huge rip of this for the first time a few minutes ago, and that was after smoking alot of other bud so take this review for what it is i guess.  First off the sample I received was of fairly high quality, taste and smell i s very pleasant like a typical sexy foreign sativa.  Effects were surprisingly calm and very spacey in the head, which i personally love.  Great for doing almost anything if you have ...”"
rpence,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1378211,"“This is a solid sativa that hits hard quick. It is a cerebral experience to say the least. If you are a fan of listening to music, sit down with some Grapefruit and a good playlist and your next hour or so should be a great one. Too much of a good thing can be bad though, I've found that one too many tokes of this can leave you feeling lazy and tired with classic red-eye and a daze sort of feeling on the way down.”"
joespit,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1336332,"“beautiful buds that almost look the color of grapefruit peel. this is probably one of my favorite tasting strains(smelling too) and it hits you good and hard, after half a fatty I was soaring! and this strain give me the munchies in the best way possible and then gives me an energy boost so I'm not bound to the couch...even though that's where I stayed”"
kushbubbles,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1378214,"“The batch I received was the perfect texture for rolling jays, dense with no seeds. The buds where long and somewhat thick with a non-uniformed hybridy sort of structure. Smells just like grapefruit and when smoked from a Jay   the consumer tastes the fruity citrus profile. 
 I experienced little to no paranoia on this strain. I have anxiety induced ADHD so usually a sativa makes me to thinky and paranoid. I had a ve...”"

BigSmokeyOG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1378204,"“Fruity smelling nice buds. Enjoyable, clear, relaxed. Nice for chilling with friends on a summer evening kinda smoke.
I'd consider it a good everyday medication, mellow and subtle high. I'd rate it 8/10.”"
Forte,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1378200,"“This is my favorite sativa strain.  The smell of this strain is amazing. It's the fruitiest smelling flower i have ever come across. This strain will give you a clear headed high and it will also makes you feel really relaxed. The effects start in forehead and work their way down to your feet. The high will last over 2 hours.”"

One of my all time favorites.”"
indica66,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1378215,"“Truely the best sativa available. This  strains flavor and smoothness is incredible. Like taking a bite of grapefruit covered with sugar. It's effects cause an immediate  blasting rush of euphoria with a tingling body sensation.

Audio_Geek,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1327791,"“Here is my overall review on this strain:

(I tried this strain both at home and outside in the forest)


Inside:  Felt a little anxious; tried watching a movie or tried doing misc errands in the house and got a little anxious with my thoughts.  My mind started to race a bit, but not too much where it was overwhelming -- It was just a bit uncomfortable.  I did notice that the "uplifting" effects from the strain start...”"

While the buzz lasts you have lots of energy, but to keep it going, just burn some more. If you stop smokin, you may fall asleep.”"

photalysis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit/reviews/1378218,"“This is a very clean sativa, but there's some clear remnants of an indica stone from its mixed lineage, with a contrasting energy that is initially energetic, and then relaxing. Smells and tastes incredible - I love the aroma of grapefruit. It's almost like the cultivators had me in mind.

This is my current favorite strain at the time of writing for introspection, meditation, creativity, and basically anything that ...”"

For me this is a happy, zippy, energetic, loosen muscles, wake & bake without teeth clenching, edgy jitters or HIGH anxiety.
