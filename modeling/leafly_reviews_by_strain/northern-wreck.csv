The buds were gigantic. My eighth was one bud that ended up weighing close to 4 grams. The buds are nice and dense mostly green with hues of purple. Nice amount of crystals that cover the entire bud. I think one of the reasons I liked this strain is that it can be used during the day. The Trainwr...”"
cretin71,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-wreck/reviews/1416053,"“Strong stuff. Every time I've bought it, THC is in the 29-31% range, so it's crazy strong. Very relaxing full body high, with cerebral effects and euphoria. First time I smoked it, I settled into the couch after a single small bowl and settled in for a night of Fargo Season 2.
