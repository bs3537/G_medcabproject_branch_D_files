Flo Walker
=============
Irish91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/flo-walker/reviews/1360205,"“Pretty nice sugar wax really shows the effect of the strain. Kind of a dazey head high along with a solid body high. I can still get stuff done but takes a little motivation. Smells lightly of berries and pot. Makes me cough a lot which can be a good sign.”"
forserious13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/flo-walker/reviews/1794924,"“Love this strain, definitely as advertised. Helps relax without couch lock, and definitely helps with pain (currently have a pinched nerve it’s helping) I’ve gotten this a few times from dispensaries and it’s never disappointed”"
