The Blueberry influences are heavy as you can tell by how the nugs smell. Strong smell of Blueberries, even through a glass nug jar. The smoke was smooth and expansive and a strong blueberry aroma on the exhale. The Diesel lineage is noticeable by the strong sativa effects. The body high becomes noticeable abou...”"

Been trying as many different strains as I can get my hands on basically nonstop for the past 7 months. That being said; blueberry diesel is one of my favorites.

I blasted some jazzy-euphoric type music while I enjoyed this blunt. It just makes you feel at ease. I consider myself a light smoker and I'm usually done with 2-3 good pulls but with this, I smoked about half of the cone. I did take it slow though, because I was warned of how strong it can be if...”"

That being said, and adding to it that everybody is different, this strain is very good but not one of my favorites.  In terms of the buzz, it's good and it's not overpowering which makes it a good daytime weed for heavy smokers.  If it were le...”"

Upon examining, by far this was my first choice. I was a little disappointed when smoking. Don't get me wrong the meds were good, pretty potent however, I did find one seed in the gram I bought, and the taste was not as strong as I was hoping.”"
