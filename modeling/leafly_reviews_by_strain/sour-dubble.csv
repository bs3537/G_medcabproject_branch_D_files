Umpquadank,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble/reviews/1413376,"“Awesome, upfront Sativa high! Great sweet-diesel flavor that lasts through the bowl. I visited my favorite rec dispensary(Buddahs wellness center) at my favorite  vacation spot(Port Orford, OR). I asked for something from the bottom shelf($30 1/8ths) suitable for joints and blunts that wouldn't put me to sleep, in addition to the top shelf 707 Headband and Durban Poison which I would use in a glass pipe. I quickly fo...”"

I smoked a couple of spliffs and would not stop talking after. I suggest not smoking this if your trying to go to sleep because it wakes you up. 10/10 would recommend this strain to anyone.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble/reviews/1486733,"“The taste of this strain is phenomenal. Until today I have only had it mixed with other strains. Gets rid of my nausea within 5 minutes of medicating. 
 The preroll I got of Sour Dubble must've had high THC%, I only dab but when I get a free preroll every now & then I don't expect it to do anything but it did. 
I always get sick taking the bus a long way, first time I don't get sick on the bus was after I smoked half...”"

Christoph3r,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble/reviews/1546922,"“Sour Dubble has made its place into a strain I need to always have on hand, usually the first I go to everyday. 
First off, the terpene profile is out of this world! Perfect sour diesel, hint of pine and so pungent, even the smoke from it is heavenly.
Second, the high is what I consider to be THE perfect sativa dominant, perfect for morning and through out the day, in small doses which is what I prefer, but in larger...”"
zennaann,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble/reviews/1330785,"“Soothing weed. When I smoked it without mixing another strain in, it was TOO relaxing for me, but if I smoked about 80-90% sour dubble mixed with 10-20% something like Hawaiian Dutch, it was perrrrfect for me. (I'm not sure how to describe the effect, but it was like slipping into a bath of "comfortable"”"
jimmyinspazzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble/reviews/1544034,"“Thoroughly enjoyed this strain from the unique flavor to the very strong buzz.  Starting out with an extremely strong head high that is similar to some of my first times getting high.  Very animated like the world is going by like the reels of a movie with flashes of red and blue similar to wearing old 3D glasses.  During this period which comes on right after taking first puff while still taking in the fullness of t...”"

Grrge,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble/reviews/1324620,"“Hard to find, but worth it. I've found this strain both times at homegrown apothecary and it's one of my favorites. I don't know how to explain it but it kicks in strong and smooth, makes your mouth water like a meringue pie. fun, giggly, talkative high. good day strain or around the campfire, good-time strain. in my top 8.”"

vikingblood1978,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble/reviews/1510800,"“Sticky fuel strain that looks smells and tasted amazing. Thanks to Mindrite Portland. I been blowing bomb since the 90s and it reminds me of the first time I got high like its a euphoric adventure which I Found myself talking a lot more to my pit while on a walk and enjoying every detail about the Oregon wilderness. Very social focused clear headed at times with a clean energy not overly done like some haze strains. ...”"

Cobek,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble/reviews/1784865,"“This strain is actually Soma's New York City Diesel crossed with B.O.G.'s Sour Bubble by B.O.G. He mentioned it in the Pot Cast at minute 28 if you want to double check Leafly editors!

Currently trying some out and it's very heady, racy stuff. Not mind numbing but definitely euphoric. The pheno I have is a kind of sticky marshmallow nug with a old dirty diesel smell with undertones of wood and spice.”"
darzulaofchaos,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble/reviews/1314968,"“Simply the best strain Ive ever had! Gets you on an amazing high. Very pungent and earthy”"
PoetUninspired,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble/reviews/1343489,"“That this strain makes you want to talk is no lie. Mentally speaking, the high is amazing and stimulating. 

I immediately wrote three pages of rants that actually made sense in a mentally cohesive way. There was a lot of rhythm in my focus. 

Physically I felt free. No heavy high here.”"
Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-dubble/reviews/1343497,"“Great sativa leaning hybrid.  Seems very hard to find. Locally, Homegrown Apothecary had it for a while, but when it's gone , it seems to be gone. Hopefully more comes up somewhere. Functional and upbeat, feels like a good ECSD for most of the high, then tapers into something very relaxing.  A top 10 strain for me.”"
