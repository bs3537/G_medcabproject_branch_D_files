CBD Kush
=============
Sonofabrokenman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1390923,"‚Äúi have been waiting to try this strain for some time. wow worth the wait. The CBD strains really help an old stoner who loves Reefer, but not the high thc strains, back in 79 i loved them, today not so much. This is a creeper with a minor head buzz, felt good from it, and would recommend to us older heads, you younglings love that crazy ass 25% thc, i cut mine on about 10% thc.Overall a strain anyone would enjoy.‚Äù"
1headcase,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1523240,"‚ÄúI have a pretty low tolerance (doesn't matter how much I smoke). I am super sensitive when it comes to how the high affects my body and mind. I get paranoid and anxious rather quickly.  However, this strain didn't produce the paranoia or anxiety for me. This was a really nice high that didn't leave me cloudy. I could still get things done, was happy and focused on whatever tasks I needed to complete. I use cannabis f...‚Äù"
Astarte,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1415592,"‚ÄúOne of the best strains available for pain relief and anti-inflammatory effects. Practically eliminates chronic pain without any brain fog or paranoia.‚Äù"

I have had 1 week with this strain so far. I do feel a head high awhile and feel some what active/ansy so I take advantage of that and do some light cleaning..then it moves more into my body and I can sit comfortably on the couch  Very relaxing, helps with pain and cramps. Haven't tried it before bed yet, however after an hour in I feel like I could nap.. but not that I need to ...‚Äù"
nalani808lukela,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1350901,"‚ÄúI love the 50/50 feel; I'm more of a sativa girl but I really enjoy the relaxing body high that comes with the 3D- CBD. I don't get a hard crash plus it's perfect for after the work day or classes or when your ready for a movie night. Keeps me alert and focused while relaxing my back pain and surgerical site. I've had both concentrate and flower; I prefer the concentrate because I tend to feel the effects more but bo...‚Äù"
FeelingElevated,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1395705,"‚Äúvery relaxing and calming. had a half of a joint and the pain is easing away slightly while leaving me clear minded. The joint was a 2:1 ratio that tested at 10.2% CBD and 4.8% THC. The only reason I stopped smoking the joint was purely due to wanting to smoke some more of this great strain before sleep! highly recommended for individuals with anxiety, general, social or even high levels of stress‚Äù"
itsthewhite1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1379838,"‚ÄúThis is a great strain for those who want both the pain relief of CBD and a little bit of a cerebral high from equal parts THC. First it starts off in the head, then moves down for relief. 

You can use this either day or night time because it will leave you feeling relaxed. A little bit of a head high but nothing that won't leave you unable to function.‚Äù"
Soulfly3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1396109,"‚ÄúMy absolute favorite strain, period. 
Tweed grows an excellent CBD Kush, that I had to go a little too long without (sold out for months).

When it comes to the shop, I stock up everytime. Great diesely sweet scent... Almost lemony/grassy vape.. The perfect high/pain relief. 

Would be the one strain Id pick for the rest of days.‚Äù"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1350900,"‚ÄúThis is a good strain for pain relief and to bring on a mellow, relaxed feeling üòéüòé without  a heavy head stone. I would not recommend this for daytime use as it does cause some foginess so it's better to use in the evening. The high CBD is wonderful to treat inflammation and pain caused by arthritis. Not an easy strain to find but if you get a chance, I would recommend to give it a try.‚Äù"
squattiepippen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1340049,"‚ÄúGreat strain after work/gym to relax the body and mind. Great before bed.‚Äù"
Coloradocalifornia2015,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1350897,"‚Äúthis strain is wasted by smoking it. it makes a killer concentrate and even better canna-oil. its great for topical application as well making edibles.
this is my top recommendation for use in making rsho. if grown properly is will proved a very resinous, above average yield. its a very hardy plant to grow, pretty low maintenance and seems to be a little pest resistant.‚Äù"
Warlikefury,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1494456,"‚ÄúI got this strain from Tweed with 7% THC and 9% CBD. I found it to be an excellent option for a mild daytime high that smoothed out my anxiety. No Rapid heartbeat no matter how much I smoked. I'm adding this strain to my favorites list for sure!‚Äù"
GaleHend,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1382767,"‚ÄúThis is indeed a strain that helps immensely with feeling calm, cool and collected.  No mental fogginess at all, no munchies either.  My biggest complaint:  it tastes like ASS!  If you can get past it's nasty taste, and sticker shock ($75/gm!) as well as major cotton mouth, you'll love it for an evening of relaxing, & binge watching iyour latest fav Netflix show.‚Äù"
nebeane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1443415,"‚ÄúThe strain I'm reviewing is called OG Kush CBD from Healthy Pharms in Massachusetts, and this is the closest I could find... 
9.9%thc / 13% cbd.
It smells a little skunky, earthy and church-incensey. There's some of that pungent kushy taste.
For me, this stuff is perfect medicine for the daytime. It knocks out my nausea and pain without being overly psychedelic or sedating. I'm not sure on the genetics (OG Kush, pres...‚Äù"
charger6060,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1302305,"‚ÄúGreat strain for overall muscle and joint pain, highly recommended if you just need to relax and unwind. Very bad dry mouth after however. Overall great and long lasting strain.‚Äù"
vikings69,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1350899,"‚ÄúI am not finding my inflammation is going down with this strain.  I have done lots of research and trying to find a medicinal that does.  
I will find out if I need to be vaping more then I am for it to work.  Will keep you posted‚Äù"

reedktl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1238800,"‚ÄúLove. This. Strain. Knocks me on my butt, in good way. No paranoia, just very mellow and happy. Great for sleep and PTSD.‚Äù"
Caver175,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1473858,"‚ÄúA great CBD strain among others. The light head buzz and high potency CBD makes this a great daytime strain having no anxiety or pain while being able to function normally, perhaps function even better.‚Äù"
thegreenlady,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1350898,"‚ÄúBrings a positive attitude without the brain fog induced by strains with higher thc.  It doesn't burn very clean if you smoke it-- makes me cough and leaves dark, sooty residue in the pipe.‚Äù"
arkphen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1359358,"‚ÄúGreat help with my anxiety problem, help me to stay focus and fonctional.‚Äù"
swedcanada,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1449316,"‚Äúthis strain was great for aneixty. allows you to be active or couch bound. Happy and talkative in social settings...over all great high would strongly recommended this strain for any one suffering with anexity‚Äù"
2palk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1382771,"‚ÄúGreat for relaxation and nighttime when mixed with indica. And great daytime when mixed with a sativa. I find the cbd mellows out the thc high which helps me alleviate the paranoia associated with some high thc strains. A great medical strain.‚Äù"
23seba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1238621,"‚Äúvery good strain
perfect for take a moment of relax, make you happy without any problem or bad things.
low thc make this strain perfect also for the day time but you have to thinks that you can't go to make do much...
taste of wood and soil make this strain a particular choice but sure a good choice!‚Äù"
hababadagada,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1380523,"‚ÄúI had this strain in a 1:1 ratio (6% THC & CBD) and it just put me right to sleep which was exactly what I was looking for. A really weak hitter (obviously due to the 6%), but good to use for anxiety or sleep issues, especially cause it provides little "high" feeling.‚Äù"
dankerclouds11,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1227806,"‚ÄúI just picked this up from my collective. Vaped .5 in my evo. Feeling really good right now, no paranoia or anxiety. just a chill ride. feel focused as well.  I've tried many high "cbd" strains, this one is the best.‚Äù"
MeadowSong,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1238046,"‚ÄúGreat relaxing happy medicine for daytime..I find that I am able to study and track information...accurately while enjoying the medicinal benefits ..I take this in a decarboxylated tincture so I am not sure sure how my dose relates to a hit or a smoking dose. I wouldn't recommend driving of course..but I just notice that I am able to track  academically and even do math in my head...with this medicine.‚Äù"
Seal36,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1272361,"‚ÄúGreat, smooth, relaxing strain.  Really liked it, with no edge at all.‚Äù"
InDaHead,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1286756,"‚ÄúThe one I use is around 10% CBD. Relaxing, helps with anxiety, no ill effects. Definitely my go to for the future.‚Äù"
le_goat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1622033,"‚ÄúAt $22 for a 1/16, this stuff is great. The taste is... not good, but the effects are perfect: nice body buzz, a bit alert, no paranoia, and the CBD did wonders for my arthritis in my feet.‚Äù"
Grooviest_Gizmo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1672900,"‚ÄúWhen we picked up the seeds for this strain from close friends, who were also growing this, we were all super excited. My mom and I were especially hyped, since both of us suffer from lifelong anxiety and depression. 
Our harvest that year was very successful, so despite it being our smallest plant, we still got a ton out of it. Having such a large supply, all of us got to try this strain many times, in flower and co...‚Äù"

alex1983gr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1627469,"‚ÄúI have MS. This is by far my BEST strain to fight the symptoms. Muscle spasms, pain and hypertension. Its suitable for day use.
I definitely recommend it.‚Äù"
adacombe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1602019,"‚ÄúNice relaxing feel, body and mind. Doesn‚Äôt make you sleepy, but doesn‚Äôt keep you awake. I found it to be similar to Cannatonic, but a stronger flavour and stronger high. Definitely good for anxiety and pain relief.‚Äù"
DrCartwrong,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1222321,"‚ÄúDoesn't get you very "high" just a relaxation minus any anxiogenic effect. I am a firm believer in CBDs neuroinhibitory effect and I think you can really feel that in areas of noiciception and arusal. perfect sedative hypnotic in my opinion.‚Äù"

greffon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-kush/reviews/1328034,"‚ÄúMassive amounts of CBD at over 14%. If you suffer from any pain, insomnia, or mental disorders, pick this one up if you have the opportunity. The high concentration of CBD will take the edge off most concerns and is the miracle behind the bud in terms of the revolutionary medical findings associated with it. ABUSE IT. Love it.‚Äù"
