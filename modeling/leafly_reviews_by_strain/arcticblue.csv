I have had a very high energy unable to sit down day and as a night cap I smoked a little of this Arctic Blue!! It was an instant body relaxation coupled with that much needed disconnect from the high stress of my day. I was sure I was going to be able to shut it down today but this strain saved me!!”"

Truly it is a master piece and work of love and art!

It leaves you with a deep relaxing mellow high and yet still keeps you motivated it is hands down the best strain on the market!”"
