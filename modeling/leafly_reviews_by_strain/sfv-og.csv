Everything below my neck started to go numb and time slowed to a snails pace. The potency on this is quite high in my opinion, and I'm sure this is a great strain for pain relief and relaxation.

LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-og/reviews/1414153,"‚ÄúDefinitely a 5 star OG strain, probably one of my favorites next to "True OG".

JDriver,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-og/reviews/1381794,"‚ÄúSFV OG is one of my favorites. It's strong, long lasting, and great for anytime use. Stress just melts away when I medicate with SFV. It does not make me sleepy at all. If your looking for this strain I've seen dispensaries mix SFV OG with SFV OG KUSH. These are two different strains.‚Äù"
Deitab,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-og/reviews/1415416,"‚ÄúYes!!! SFV OG is a pretty hard hitting bud.  Husband has a hard time admitting he's buzzed, and this one got him to say yep, I feel it.  Probably not the best strain for going to sleep, but if you smoke enough you can end up vertical.‚Äù"

LaGoong,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-og/reviews/1363400,"‚ÄúWith its smallish nugs, SFV  OG doesn't offer much in the way of "bag appeal." But it definitely makes up for that insignificant flaw in the areas of aroma, taste and buzz. Smell is a powerful citrusy, piney sort of blend which is quite pleasing to the seasoned smoker's beak. Powerful expander on the inhale, so don't go packing a huge rip unless your goal is a coughing fit.That said, a coughing fit will definitely in...‚Äù"
