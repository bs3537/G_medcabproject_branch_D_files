surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/legendary-lemon/reviews/1316506,"“True to it's crazy, historic lineage link to "Oaxaca", this strain tends to sway heavy on male when discussing the ratios of seed production. I remember Oaxaca from the 70's. Loaded with seeds. Great strain regardless of its tenancy to produce lots of boys and many times boys/girls. 

Legendary Lemon gives it's deliciously yummy medicine right, Potent and tasty!”"
