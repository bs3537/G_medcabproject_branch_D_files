Flo OG
=============
HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1393809,"“FLO OG ~ Look for dark green nugs with purple highlights. NUGS LOOK LIKE 🍐 (PEARS!) Sweet and Floral tones with a little Hash expression on the exhale. Indica-dom at 70/30...So, good bye pain! Insomniacs, embellish! This gave me a little boost then shut shit down for the evening. Happy 420, Y'all!”"
Stargasm420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1389830,"“By far one of my favorite strains. The couch lock is absolutely ridiculous and the body buzz is absolutely incredible.”"
samjdrinkwater,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1389831,"“This is one of my absolute favorite strains. I was already a fan of Flo, but adding the Rare Dankness #1 for that extra indica makes this a must have for me for relaxing before bed. For me this strain leaves my thoughts fairly clear, but calm, and has an amazing body effect that just melts away any tension or pain.”"
Vera007,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1540798,"“Get's me super horny right away lol. Very deep soothing buzz, and Flo lets me sleep all the way through the night.”"
EB963,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1544551,"“This is the best migraine relief! I’ve been experimenting with different strains for migraines and most work good but this one erases the pain and nausea. The taste is very earthy.”"
Krisgooch78,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1418493,"“better as butter than flower”"
Smokinsince95,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1526033,"“I have never been a fan of flo... I think it sucks and is way over rated. So I was hesitant to try this for the longest time. So to my surprise when I did and loved the flavor and effects, I had to say I started to get this more often, although this isn't my favorite RD strain it is still AMAZING and if your a Flo fan, this Buds for you!!”"
TyphoidMary,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1536324,"“I will say Flo OG gets a 5/5 regarding easing my tense muscles and cramps. It helped me sleep. 

Unfortunately, it totally gave me the weed chills.  That usually makes me feel somewhat  anxious until I sleep it off.

It isn't my favorite weed, but my girlfriend loves it.”"
sidewalkstonergirl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1376851,"“Reviews are spot-on about this one. This couch is a legit sinkhole now. 

Tastes like peach with a crisp kick and will leave you relaxed but alert. Muscle tension will release, and you may crave mint iced tea.”"

Samleo1914,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1389832,"“I had Flo OG in concentrate and It is a wonderful, clean, functional high. This "indica" changes the game for most indicas because of how focused you get, and you don't feel like sinking in to the couch.”"
misdameana,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1383082,"“This is some sweet dankness!  We vaped and immediately felt effects ... euphoria, body buzz, and relaxation.  What a nice high!  I was energized and totally chill at the same time.  Tasted notes of berry and citrus as we smoked.  Flo OG just became one of my faves.”"
LotusKai,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1680661,"“This one is an interesting combo of a over-hyped mediocre strain (Flo) with a great Indica (Rare Darkness). It's most definitely an Indica dominant strain but the Flo adds in an airy almost dreamlike quality to the high while simultaneously eliminating the bogginess one can get with Indica's. As someone who doesn't really care for Flo (I've only ever had ONE batch that actually blew my socks off) I really enjoyed thi...”"
Bwanadik,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1663019,"“Beautiful big sticky buds that will rock your world. This strain has legs that will keep you going for hours. Nice stony euphoric buzz, with some serious couch lock. If you have anyone to do, do it before you smoke. Some of the best I’ve ever smoked. Too sticky for joints, so you’ll need a pipe.”"

Dopebuddy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1691006,"“Part two(I was cut off by a badly timed FaceTime call of my wife from the water closet). 
I wake up essentially rested AF and also I developed a light migraine( I get them rarely a few times a year. ) the night before but as I was sleepy and somehow it allowed my to sleep throughout the night. 

The migraine persisted through my cold brew in bed and was leading to queasy waves radiating back and forth between my bowl...”"
PickledPup,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1763279,"“A bit dizzy at first, but after that it was good. Slept really well.”"
loudoeksmo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1425380,"“found it with a lot of nice purple but good crystals flaking .. and leaves one of the greatest tasting buds I've ever exhaled.. def gives the pros and med def 👍🙌👏.. such a great feeling 😁”"
HippieTrippie562,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1481094,"“Such an uplifting and happy strain, not smooth but not harsh, it’s just about right 🤙🏼”"
JorgeG62,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1392714,"“Deep forest and dark pine green dense nugs with flecks of purple and rich orange threads, completely dusted in powdery white frost.  Sweet berry taste, a little earthy, great flowery aroma.  Very solid pain relief, quite powerful but workable, primarily body with a nice euphoric onset.  

Another excellent NETA strain, stats from batch 718, TAC 28.9, THCA 27.3, D9THC 0.4, CBDA 0.1, CBC 0.2, CBGA 0.9”"
DoctorFunkenstein,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1470276,"“From a growing standpoint,  this strain produces colas as thick as an arm. Finished in just about 9 weeks. Fantastic choice for meds!”"
Islandgirl86,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1494368,"“I really don't like how this one tastes but it does make me feel relaxed after a long stressful day!”"

N8tiveCOKush303,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1486625,"“Definitely an Indica, Flo OG gets the body feeling good! It's stank is probably the first thing you'll notice with this bud, like Mary Jane ripped a weed fart for real! LoL The strain description says functional but if you don't HAVE to do anything, then you're probably not going to WANT to do anything LoL...aaand now I'm all stoned and I don't want to type anymore sooo”"

MrsMoose420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1544194,"“Flo OG will hit in such a way where the first 10 minutes after a puff are a bit anxious, but this is worth the slight discomfort as it quickly passes and becomes the complete opposite, the most calming and medicating feeling takes over and it's really the best strain I've ever experienced. It's my favorite.”"

brizeey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1529293,"“Calming, chill high. Muscle relaxation and pain relief definitely provided by a bowl of Flo OG. Wouldn't say it's the best for when you have to concentrate on work. My head feels a bit light, off in the clouds.”"

stfujesska,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1763848,"“I didn't think I felt much couch lock until I look back I realized I picked up a book and sat reading it for a while, so I guess I did! This strain really uplifted me, pulling a lot of creativity out and mentally relaxed me. Smooth floral taste and such a cute petite look (whomever left a review stating it looks like a pear is spot on).”"
The_Entheogenist,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1777561,"“"Mellow" is a perfect descriptor.  The body gets really loose and relaxed.  The mind isn't slowed, but there's a pervading sense that everything is cool.”"

MermAndy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1792451,"“I smoke nightly and picked up this strain to try.  I’m also a tall - I say this because I had two decent sized hits at 10:30 and it’s 10:41, but I’m pretty sure I’ve been writing this review for 15 minutes.  Body is loose, head is lofty and I’m having a good time.  Also, I think I’ve developed spidery sense because I’m listening to my wife’s phone conversation, while writing this and watching Don Lemon with a CNN ale...”"
HybridNoisebloom,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1769296,"“Really nice for my head and body pain, as well as being good when I need to fall asleep as well despite being a regular hybrid.  Helps with when I need to do tasks that I feel depressed to do, like shower or write (for two examples). It hits real hard real fast in all of my experiences, which may or may not be a plus depending on your tastes. Stays a while too :3c”"
HunterJ313,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1706817,"“This Strain is amazing, the trichromes on the buds were crazy! Buds were a beautiful light green that darkened on the outside. It’s smells of pungentness and somewhat citrusy smell mixed amazingly. If you love a nice indica buzz but still want to do stuff after you smoke, I would definitely recommend this strain.”"

carolinexliz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1524138,"“Had this as a concentrate and love it. Functional high but has the calming effect of an indica. After one hit we felt the body and cerebral high. Only thing is I find it makes me a little dizzy, but the high compensates.”"
TommyCruz33,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flo-og/reviews/1519712,"“So tasty! Colorado Flo X Rare Dankness' Male Og. Grape terpene profile, with a sweet-savory smell and a subtle cookies resemblance. 🔥🔥🔥”"
