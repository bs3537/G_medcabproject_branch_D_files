Being down south, both these strains are hard to come by. Master skunk is by far the most body dominating strain I've ever consumed other than the deep deep indicas. 5 star smoke for sure!”"

Altie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/master-skunk/reviews/1210136,"“Master Kush is by far one of the best all time strains, its buds are covered by big eye popping trichomes that covers ever the flower stem. Just by looking at that the bud will contain a high amount of THC between 19%-21%, the mind high will stay for 3-5 hours while the body high will last for 2-4 hours usually activating after 30min of smoke the CBD will take effect and the body high will begin.”"

A good strain for before bed or before a funny movie. Wouldn't suggest beginners to smoke this strain, it will get you super stoned. But if you are a veteran smoker by all means dive in on a rip. This shit is fire”"

McDice,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/master-skunk/reviews/1234928,"“Such a relaxing high. I first indulged in some Master Skunk recently. I noticed it had great consistency as well as this pungent skunky smell with a berry hint to it. I've smoked this out of every piece one can imagine and it is an enjoyable experience no matter what the glass or paper. But I truly enjoy grasping this buds taste through a nice bowl. Although I like to smoke grass any given day, this bud seems to keep...”"

ChrisMacDowell,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/master-skunk/reviews/1301983,"“I don't know what it is about Master Kush, but I've always found it to be ineffective for my anxiety. This hybrid, however, was  the contrary: uplifting and relaxing, also a bit on psychedelic/creative side. I experienced a tiny but of paranoia, but no where NEAR as serious as my  "regular Master K". sessions. Love love LOVE that stinky, skunky flavor.”"
VAGINAHAZE,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/master-skunk/reviews/1162223,"“Just sittin here with a few buddies indulging into some MASTER SKUNK.  Joints are medium size and we did 3 HUGE buckets each.  I will tell you right now, I am a seasoned vet.  This by far is the best weed I smoke.. Dont smoke it on the regular, as you WILL get amune.  However in my opinion this is the HEAVIEST strain available.”"
richban1007,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/master-skunk/reviews/1326593,"“Shockingly high at first. Hit me hard after 4 hits of a vape. Very heady and tingly over entire body. Totally useless on this bud so don't make plans. Little paranoid at first. Had to remind myself to calm down and enjoy. Then it was fun. Couldn't stop laughing at times and other times just zoned out watching TV. Slept like a baby and woke up energized and happy productive. Not sure if feeling awesome the next mornin...”"
