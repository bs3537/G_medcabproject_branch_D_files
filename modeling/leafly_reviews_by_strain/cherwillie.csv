Awesome flavor as well!”"

It isn't a racy sativa... its strength is its mood elevation and motivation. You'll want to get stuff done because you feel good, you know what I mean? There's no major comedown, it isn't sleepy, tastes good, prepares you for task-conquering... what's not to like?”"

The grower/brand was Sticky Budz and it was in a pre-roll!”"
