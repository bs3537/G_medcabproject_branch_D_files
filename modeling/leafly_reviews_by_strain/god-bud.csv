I'm finding that if I play a video game after using it I'm going to spend a few hours there, watch TV and the same results.  When I do go to bed my pain relief lasts through the night and I am very pleasantly surprised that it completely stands in for the morphine. Overall good medicine”"

I would absolutely recommend it for someone with anxiety, or mild pain management issues.  It had a very gradual calming effect that made stress feel like it was melting away.  Once calm and relaxed, I could focus on the other things I needed to accomplish through out my day.  Definitely kicks anxiety and ADD right in the bum.”"
