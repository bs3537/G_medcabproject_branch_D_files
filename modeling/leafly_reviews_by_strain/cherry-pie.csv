I haven't ever smoked in my 35 yrs of life; however, my panic/anxiety got the better of me when I unfortunately had no medication and I couldn't get a refill.  I was blessed with 1 drag of this particular strain and I have to say it changed my life.  I now have my card and only smoke when I need it, maybe a couple times a month.  This strain does not make me feel high, paranoid, o...”"

I got this one as a shake bag (a very killer bag from my dispensary, by the way) and it knocked me on my butt! I'm a veteran smoker and it takes a quality flower to impress me, this Cherry Pie wins first prize. No lie, Very pleasant smelling and tasting as well. Heavy cerebral stone, but good energy.

gigglypuff,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-pie/reviews/1393011,"“Cherry pie has a humble yet beautiful look. The lightish green bud is speckled with orange hairs. This strain rides down easy, being a softer inhale. The high definitely takes a few minutes to fully hit the smoker. While it does have a pretty strong head affect, it still relaxes the body just slightly enough to allow the smoker to remain productive if so desired. The flavor of this strain was that of a very faint bla...”"

I love them all for pain relief and euphoria. Phantom Cookies (CP and GDP) is a bit more energizing than Girl Scout and is better for a relaxing movie night.

I get stoned quicker on Cherry Pie than on any other strain. I smell and taste some sweet and some spice. CP smokes pretty harsh so be sure to have water nearby. I either cough or get phlegm in my throat. I consider CP to be a "typical stoner" strain. Everything arounds you slows down, your mind is racing, but you just look off into the distance. Ov...”"
ZachReviews,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-pie/reviews/1357619,"“This particular hybrid made me feel the cerebral effects AND body effects, but wasn't overly powerful in either of those categories. It best suited me after a long day of classes and work, and helped me to, ultimately, relax. The smell is super dank and I ground it up which made for an even better smell. The "cherry" in the Cherry Pie was completely absent also.”"

Realife,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-pie/reviews/1360759,"“I love this strand. I had an ounce recently, and it was wonderful. I would say the best part is the taste. It's magnificent! One downfall, however, is if in an area where it's illegal, you can't, and SHOULDN'T take it out of the house. Even if you have an air sealed container, the scent is stronger than any I've experienced. It will take over any room.”"
