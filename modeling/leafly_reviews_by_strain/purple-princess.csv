DevyantByson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-princess/reviews/1380725,"“really nice head high, noticed a little cough so I broke it up and noticed that was a better idea. this girl has allot of branches tucked in her, not a terrible pain though because it's easier to decipher flower because of her dark purple color.  the feeling i instantly have after smoking it is it makes me feel happy in my head, really nice to listen to music on or some sexual adventure, I can see too. I donated a 25...”"
ErosKing,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-princess/reviews/1366895,"“Yep..It's a Creeper. For me it started in my head,and slowly crept down into my body. I felt really good for about an hour n half,then I started to feel it moving downward. After a another hour or so.. (I don't remember) I got really tired, and went to bed.”"
Sapphyy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-princess/reviews/1380726,"“Definitely a creeper. The first 10 minutes or so your mildly high and enjoying it than BAM! Your straight retarded! Great smelling, looking, and tasting bud. For $10 a gram I was super pleased! I would say it's medicinally good for Stress and Depression!”"

Purple Princess is a nice bud very purple with alot of orange hairs and tricomes, it smelled just like purps with a kick!

acm49giant,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-princess/reviews/1570487,"“Funky smell with hints of dirt and wood. Dark green with purple tinges and orange hairs. Fine strain for putzing around the house doing nothing. Didn’t make me exceptionally happy or anything. Just kind of went about my day with it in the background. It’s fine if that’s all they got but wouldn’t go out my way to find it again.”"

iamkeysersose,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-princess/reviews/1425762,"“It's definitely really, really pretty. It has a lot of purple and some orange hairs, and is dense and bushy. I'm guessing it should have a fruitier taste, because I mainly could taste skunk with a little hint of fruitiness. As far as the high itself, it's definitely sativa dominant, because I got a lot of the head buzz at first and it made me a little anxious. But then after a while it melts down into a nice relaxati...”"

allgovernmentsLIE,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-princess/reviews/1380732,"“Though the name of this flavor is somewhat girly and, well, childish, this flower is anything but. 

She truly is beautiful. Majestic shades of violent throughout the buds, with a very light scent that's sweet and citrusy. The taste is incredibly light, but the effect is very strong. Super mellow, soothing, relaxing feeling... the kind of indica that really helps unclench uptight muscles from a long day of work as ...”"

I smoked my usual amount of shatter and sat down to play Borderlands2 with my husband. About 15 min later it hit me like a ton of bricks! For the next 30 min I was so medicated I could barely function LOL not that it was bad. Then it faded to an overall body tingle, definite arousal (much sex was had), and then a serious crash. It was very enjoyable.

Awesome for sleep and not bad for body p...”"

The taste reminded me of some Candyland weed I had recently. The high was a little intense but only for a short time. I think it's really just another gimmick hybrid with a trendy name.”"

When smoked, this shit gets you a really nice head and body high but leaning more towards the head. All in all, it delivers a nice head buzz with a relaxed body. However I noticed when I smoked this, I coughed more than normal (Yeah this shit makes you cough). The flavor of this strain is great as well. Not so much earthy, more fruity tasting in my opinion. All around great strain! I'm...”"
