Sage N Sour
=============
OCWeedReview,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sage-n-sour/reviews/1377336,"“Sour Sage, often listed as Sage n’ Sour, is a combination of two potent sativa expressive hybrids, Sour Diesel and S.A.G.E.  As we saw in a previous review, Sour Diesel is much like sex.  Even when it’s bad, it’s still pretty good.  Mixing with this euphoric sativa is S.A.G.E. (Sativa Afghani Genetic Equillibrium).  S.A.G.E was bred to be the perfect 50/50 hybrid.  I feel a bit dirty messing with perfection, but the ...”"

Also great to wake and bake if you need a boost of energy to get moving in the morning. This is a great one if you are battling fatigue or depression. It will get you up and moving around without a strong head high. Start slow with a one hitter, and watch yourself emerge from the darkness and again become a...”"

I pinched this fat flower late in day after chillin with Pj & few other Hazy kats. I could not resist the temptation of this sinfully delicious master blend. A love boat of flavors, citrus, spice and everything nice. Smooth and oh so powerful, trumping my previous medicated state.

The buds were dense as fuck and all the joints I rolled required to be relit multiple times, but it was worth it. What it did for me was get me stupid stoned for 10-15 minutes, like really intensely baked. Then it kinda levels off into a lower more manageable level, but this stuff made me stay feeling high for ho...”"

Once exhaled, a sweeping state of euphoria takes gentle hold of you body and mind. Immediately I began to feel my anxiety and stress wash away, not in a "this feels good" kind of way but in a one hundred percent, life is great kind of way. I get very inspired by this particular herb to pick up my guitar and write new music. I recommend this strain for anyone dealing with...”"

I wouldn't rate this strain a five out of five however I prefer fruity smells and tastes. This strain is great if you're having one of those depressed or rainy day moods.

I took about 3 tokes and immediately started feeling "good".  What I mean by that is, my senses were elevated higher than normal where different stimuli like sounds and smells brought a 'good mood' effect to me.  I had many happy thoughts and there were smells and sounds that brought back happy memories.  I also fel...”"

Vaporidezer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sage-n-sour/reviews/1475747,"“Based on my 2 - 3 experiences with this strain, it's pretty nice in small amounts, but especially in daily use somehow it just gets too faint in it's effect, in order to really shine as a sativa, so I give it only 3 stars.

Maybe i've had only weak batches, who knows, but this is over couple of years time span when I tested these 3 sage n sours. It's a nice breed, but would need some more balance I think.”"
