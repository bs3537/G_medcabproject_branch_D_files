Guava Chem

JeNDiNor0620,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-chem/reviews/1413860,"“Guava Chem is a little gem of a day time flower. I've smoked it a dozen times or so. It's a very clear head high. It last for about two hours. It's one of those flowers that builds on its high if you smoke a lot of it in one sitting. You can't just smoke one bowl and expect to get all of its potency. It's nice for people with high tolerance and lower tolerance as well. Like most sativas, it helps deal with fatigue an...”"

cascadianmass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-chem/reviews/1388079,"“Yum Yum!!!  This one's genetics are intense. So it's a Star Dawg (Chem Dawg4 xTres Dawg) X Tres Dawg (Chem DawgD x Double Dawg [{Chem DawgD} x{Afghani #1}].  So Chemdawg4, and ChemDawgD finally cross genetics, and the Tres Dawg that's crossed within Stardog essentially backcrosses onto another Tres Dawg. Tres Dawg is already Chem DawgD back crossed with Afghani #1 added for flavor.  It's ridiculous. It tastes like th...”"
SweetHerbTreats,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-chem/reviews/1357540,"“Great after work strain. It's incredibly relaxing but without the strong couch lock I get from other strains. I found this great for anxiety and depression relief, as well as a nice creativity stimulus.”"
GrapesonGrapesonGrapes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-chem/reviews/1329271,"“Sweet! This stuff looks awesome. The smell is pungent and tropical. The buds are very round and fat, and very sticky. Light green and covered in orange. They broke up beautifully just using my fingers. The taste was extremely sweet and fruity. It is a nice balance of both parents. The high was a bit of a creeper. Settling into a nice body buzz. Great for pain, stress relief, and insomnia.”"
bmajiq,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-chem/reviews/1413863,"“Picked up some from euflora, in aurora. Definitely very Chemdawg-y. But significantly fruitier. The smell is absolutely amazing and the buds are classic Chem in looks and how they break down. Definitely give it a gooood toke if u can find some.”"
xpressdphenotype,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-chem/reviews/1235711,"“Purchased from Magnolia Road (in Boulder). Smells like gummy bear (bubblegum x jilly bean) or moonshine haze. Its a hybrid that will surprise you”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-chem/reviews/1350813,"“Great anytime hybrid, puts you in a long lasting great mood and the smell and taste are top of the charts. Ultra citrusy Chem Dawg. Crazy genetics that crossbred many different chem dawg strains together to end up with this masterpiece. Might be a little sativa leaning overall but pretty balanced. A little will leave me upbeat and focused and lot will leave me couch locked, thinking deep thoughts but never really sed...”"

superocean9,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-chem/reviews/1615011,"“Lucky to find this outstanding strain in soft pressed Hash form. Really easy on the throat with great uplifting relaxed mindset. The absence of any couch lock makes for a truly fun experience. Explore outdoors or get creative on this one. Will be back . .but may have to search more then one source.”"
mickfromkent,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-chem/reviews/1268678,"“I much prefer  indica over sativa. However  fir daytime  indicas can be very quieting  and sleeping. So  I  have  tried  different  sativas for  pain relief but still  able  to  be active. Guave chem is very different  to other sativas imo. Lots  of insightful  thinking  and amazing  sex.  You  need  to stay  hydrated  with Guava and your heart  can race a bit. A little  mild paranoia  from the excitation  level. I  ...”"

When I smoke this shit, I feel like I've crossed into a magical new demention.. Not that I see anything, but it just feels soo damn good and magical. It's the vibe of being in a different demention that makes me feel so simply good ;)”"

After looking at pictures and comparing reviews and profiles for both Guava Chem and Guava Kush, I believe Guava Chem is what I have/Guava Haze is a variant of Guava Chem.

I'm not one for sativas, sativa-dominant hybrids, or so I thought. GTR recommended this strain to me, and has it listed as a sativa, so I was skeptical. This is by far m...”"
