andrewj06,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ray-charles/reviews/1433751,"“I'm not a huge indica fan, actually the budtender told me it was a hybrid. Well after smoking it I quickly realized it is a heavy indica.  I did however enjoy it.  I waited until closer to bedtime to try it just in case it would make me tired and I'm glad I did. The taste and smell is fantastic. Quickly, but gently put me into a sedative state.  When I finally called it a night, I slept like a rock. 
If you have prob...”"

crickersays,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ray-charles/reviews/1687042,"“Purchased from Grassroots in Maryland. 22.10% THC; 2.56% Myrcene; very low in all other Terps, but can taste the .15% a-Pinene and .07% b-Pinene for sure. 

Nugs are sticky and dense. Dark, afghani look, with dark orange pistils suffocating the leaves. 

Very mellow high. Absolutely crushed my anxiety. With each puff, intense euphoria ensued. Two hours in, I'm definitely starting to get couch locked and my eyes are g...”"

RayVoodooArmstrong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ray-charles/reviews/1651408,"“First time smoking this, I sit down to practice guitar -which usually isn’t very productive when I’m stoned- but this time I was shredding like I never have before. Maybe the name is just a coincidence, think what you will but id like to believe the spirit of Ray Charles himself was around me flowing through my sweet rifts.”"

For two years I’ve searched for the sweet flower that will just knock me out for a few hours. ME AND RAY GOTTA A DATE EVERY NIGHT! This is the perfect strain for before bed. 
I smoked a .5 pre roll from WCC in IL. A smooth smoke with nice earthy tones. It settles in all at once. Your shoulders just relax and your body gets tingly. Everything becomes OK, nothing cam...”"

Welcome to Ray Charles. It’s the type of strain you can watch a Netflix series with. I had minimum cough. It a full body high. I needed a second blunt to reduce my back pain. 

Ray Charles to this Bullshit.”"

Not for activity. There's extreme couch lock potential here, like a soft, fluffy cloud brick to the back of the head - I mean that in the nicest way possible.”"

I have ptsd and I always have issue with stress anxiety and insomnia.

I got the Grassroots Take Five 3.5g Prerolls of this strain and melted my stress very quickly. I very quickly began to get stuck tired and extremely sleepy. All you NEED is a joint of .5-.7 and you'll be meditating and relaxing in your dreams quick and for a while.
