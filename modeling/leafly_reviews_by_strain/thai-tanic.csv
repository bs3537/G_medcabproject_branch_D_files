rudierules,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thai-tanic/reviews/1283769,"“Very nice head high, a bit jittery with morning coffee, but gets you into a focused  work mode and keeps you there for a long while. A classic sativa with lots of punch, great pain control and clarity.”"
Lostgirl26,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thai-tanic/reviews/1685872,"“This is the best strain I've had in a minute. I love this I'm so relaxed and happy and I'm focused so it's great for work.  It's is also great for night time for relaxing and taking a bath or watching Netflix then falling asleep. It tastes like chocolate and is kind of spicy. I get a good head high but I'm focused. I love this strain.😍😍”"
