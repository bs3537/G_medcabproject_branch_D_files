quik13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1412550,"“This was the second strain I have ever tried, since I'm a new medical patient due to a back injury and nerve pain. 

There was no high feeling at all from this strain, just a sense of calm and relaxation. It is a lot like Cannatonic yet it leaves me with less of the very sleepy feelings that Cannatonic gave me. It reduces inflammation very quickly, so it helps remove a source of my pain but it doesn't get rid of the ...”"

I usually get anxious or paranoid, and not even a little bit with this, and for once I smoked more that my little chicken puffs trying to avoid the paranoia. My bf was SUPER extra cute and cuddly, it was adorable. He said it took his headache away last night. It's improved my pain and inflammation from ...”"

RElapse788,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1366459,"“Afghani CBD is a great strain for pain control and Insomnia. It is a  perfect example of an Indica stain. Minutes after consuming; your pain becomes a distant memory, and a nice relaxing and focused couch lock sets in. If you are using this strain for Insomnia I would recommend heading to bed as soon as you begin to feel the effects.  I experienced a weird side effect that caused me to become fidgety and itchy if I w...”"
bigpopachuck,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1344471,"“Really relaxing bud. Great great grrreat.  The CBD content is nice making Afghani weed high both strong and relaxing at the same time. Also side note- from my research, I believe this is a indica/ruderalis hybrid.”"
Riddlechip,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1365560,"“I was very excited about this strain and finally took the jump and got myself a nice little stash from my friends at Tilray. 

Sweet freshness as soon as I opened the bag, smooth and earthy with grape undertone that made my mouth water. Very mild head high combined with a euphoric relaxing body. Even though the mental high was fairly low I did find myself very distracted and unfocused but it actually made it enjoyabl...”"

I have DP/DR as well as anxiety and PTSD , i can not handle high THC strains any more . I immediately felt healing properties with my first pull off this batch . The smell is very clean , fresh , strong and has great cannabis pheromones coming off it . I feel my mind relax as well i am getting caught in thoughts fro...”"

thyroidrx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1365563,"“Slow onset, but lasting relief for pain, inflammation, and depression. This strain makes me more "giggly" and hits me a little harder than other CBD varieties I have tried. After a few days I'm starting to build up a tolerance to its mild (but pronounced) mental effects but it's definitely worth keeping in my strain rotation. 

My local dispensary relabeled their variety as "CBD God" with a 2:1 CBD to THC ratio.”"

lemondeeststone,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1384539,"“It smells a bit like fruity cough syrup, I thinks it's because of the CBD content. It was the first time I tried CBD and I'm not disappointed. It feels like a lighter high in the head and stronger in the body, super relaxing. I like to vape it and usually I don't like to vape.”"
lucid44,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1719511,"“I've been afraid to touch cannabis for 9 months now, due to it triggering severe anxiety and dp/dr. But a while back i heard about cbd strains, and i decided to give it a shot. I was not dissapointed. I've smoked small amounts of this strain, and each time it gives me all the good parts of being high (euphoria, relaxation), without any of the negative side effects. I reccomend this strain to anyone who's had bad expe...”"
mellecorriveau,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1442437,"“One of my favourite strains. Makes you feel so relaxed and frees you of all physical pain and mental worries. Makes you body feel kind of like jello but without mental cloudiness. Love this strain, love CBD :)”"
skipadee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1305216,"“Migraine? What migraine?! Didn't even have to take my heavy migraine meds and only had to smoke this once before it completely stopped my pain without it returning. If you suffer from any form of headache I'd highly recommend this beautiful miracle. I smoked the last of it to cure another migraine last night and I'm grieving the loss of this strain!! Hope it comes back around to my local dispensary soon...”"

Tibet,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1365561,"“Got my shipment from Tilray, the first hit from this was fantastic. You are suddenly overwhelmed with floral & sweet notes on exhale following with the calming indica body high. 

Great for anxiety!”"

Gusbeygi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1299695,"“If you have body pain AND if you have time to sit down and relax then this one is for you. Moving around reduces the effect it's suppose to have for pain. Very minimal high, but it does absolute wonders for the body. 

Within about 10-15 minutes of smoking, the body relaxes and mellows out and pain becomes a memory. 

I recommend smoking relatively close to bed time and not during the day as this strain (at least for...”"

JackieBee421,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1365565,"“I loved Afghani CBD, mainly because I smoke cannabis for my chronic pain and inflammation. And I HIGHLY! Recommend anyone with pain and inflammation to try this strain.”"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1356495,"“Afghani CBD is a great strain to treat pain and restlessness. This strain is ideally suited to use in the evenings as it does tend to cause a bit of couch lock. Consuming it will result in a very relaxed feeling with a lovely body buzz and a good amount of pain relief. The effects last about 2 hours before a top up is needed and it does facilitate sleep. Overall a great strain with all the benefits of high CBD.”"
mellowchuck202,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1365564,"“Great Kush. Lineage has to be close to the Original Kush. Tastes so delicious and "kushy."


Nice big fluffy buds with hues of purple amongst the light and dark green.

Good for anxiety, sleep disorders, nervousness.”"

RedVans,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1700353,"“I vaped this strain and at first i didn't think much of it. I felt the body high come one slowly but it didn't have a massive indica feel to it at first. Within a half hour I was completely couch locked and had super heavy eyes. the euphoric effects were amazing. Cotton mouth was killing me, I was drinking so much water. No anxious or paranoid thoughts whatsoever, I could maintain a conversation even though I was cou...”"

loafmoomy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani-cbd/reviews/1321563,"“I love the smell (floral/earthy with citrus/fruity undertones) and it is very smooth. A favourite for taste alone! This one has very minimal head high, and relaxing/calming body high. I can sleep or get up and do stuff equally with this one. Most definitely helps with my chronic pain from EDS.”"
