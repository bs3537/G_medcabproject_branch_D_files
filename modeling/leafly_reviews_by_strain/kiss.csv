rizlo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kiss/reviews/1336189,"“i got it as 'mega queso'..guess it is that strain because it has typical uk cheese smell..I get that strain at sativa side but turns out it's a heavy indica..very good smell..nice bud..first 10 mins body high comes but then another wave of body buzz and body high came and sits like an hour..it's last long and good strain..it's not a sativa tho”"

mirafitz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kiss/reviews/1257215,"“I picked up a gram of queso fuertes and smoked my first bowl of this strain. So far I'm feeling clear headed and productive-- seems like a great before - work option. It's my day off so I bust out the art supplies and, BAM! Magic.”"
