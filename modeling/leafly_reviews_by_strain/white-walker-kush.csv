=============
russell887,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1368931,"“Loved this strain for several reasons, provides a very nice high and I also really liked the flavor. Breaks up nice and fluffy for rolling and the strain provides great relief. I prefer smoking this when at home relaxing rather than being out trying to accomplish something as the high can get a little intense. Great strain though, I love taking my time smoking this as I really do enjoy the taste of this bud.”"

But be warned, if you take too many hits, you'll end up a couch potato. But overall it's a really nice strain. I love mixing it with Elephant OD. ♡”"
DJCF83,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1392706,"“Great hybrid strain. Immediately after smoking some of this I had a rush of energy and my mind was clear. When the high really kicked in, it slowly sucked me into the couch. Great for day and night time use in my opinion.”"

Indicateme,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1350950,"“I really liked this strain. Only 4 or 5 puffs and you feel very relaxed and uplifted. Very good for my depression and anxiety. The high is steady and lasts quite a few hours. Also helped my lack of appetite and insomnia. This one moves to the "top 3" on my list.”"

The Grounds: very dark green, almost no light green in any of this full gram preroll.
The Smell: Very funky, then a lot of pungent diesel like aromas of tar.
The Vape: Very thick bag suspecting to be a choker.
The Toke: Surprisingly very smooth, I am ...”"

I naturally when vapourizing use a blend of the strains  and tend to try strains alone by themselves when I first receive them on the three week schedule we use to provide me.  This however is a standout strai...”"

lovingsommers,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1541190,"“Amazingly lucid high, with a calm/happy  feeling that last hours. No paranoia or munchies either. Happily received from Brokencoast.”"
Steele50,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1684329,"“Great smell and taste, floral, earthy and slightly citrusy. Very relaxing and stress free. Body feels gooood. Sedated, but not too sleepy to have earlier in the night.”"
Thedank26,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1523308,"“This is a great hybrid you get both a little sativa and indica good 50/50 high. Has a great taste to it kinda floral and spicy all in one. this is a difinate nightime herb. Classic parents bud structure is more like white widow but the plumpness of skywalker makes for some heavy dank buds. Great for pain and insomnia. All around good weed.”"

Aresem,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1344535,"“Very pretty buds on this one, fluffy but not airy. It has a curious smell I can best compare to ammonia, citrus, and pine. It took a minute or two to really hit me but it has a nice feel, relaxed but not out of it. A good choice for when you plan on watching some TV or reading, I think.”"
Hemigirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1458671,"“My tush ain't walking anywhere. I'm all Kushed out. All over body high! Like it! Did two small hits.”"

Kommano,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1327746,"“All around good strain very frosty but smaller yields compared to most. The high is long lasting and doesn't give couch lock. Makes you hungry so watch out if you don't like that.”"

lunodoom,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1500836,"“Got this in extract from in a cart. One of my favorite highs, gives you the relaxation and euphoria of an indica, yet not only did it not put me to sleep, this keeps me up. Great for when you have shit to do but want to take the edge off.”"

Big beautiful 4G nug. Frosty, dark purple and green. Super dense. Floral and pine smell. Amazing sweet earthy inhale and juniper sweet pine on exhale. Very unique and nothing I’ve ever tasted. Will try more by these growers for sure. Melty chill high that would be good for daytime then naps.”"
Corojo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1663038,"“So I have been smoking this strain for a little over a week now. I can safely say that this is one of the easiest . Mellow buds I have had since going to the dispensary. It doesn’t over power you with. Head high. But it also doesn’t leave you wondering this is all it has to offer. It leaves you light an airy.”"
Jdinkalagefahey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1643556,"“A hybrid of 2 greats. This strain will elevate you to a headdy high that perfectly balances ecstatic and relaxed. A good social feeling of chatter and giggles. Group smoke seshes were forever changed after the creation of this strain.”"

Lyconius,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1703769,"“excellent strain for those days when you wanna chill and veg out on Netflix comedy specials all day!

ericgrain,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1236259,"“Have a bowl in my Pax 2 right now, the effects settled in quick and worked quiet well for stress and depression. Has a not unpleasant, nor pleasant taste to it. 

I agree with one of the other reviews in saying It is nice but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.”"
bleafnmiracles,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1250131,"“I was sold this as an "indica", recommended to me from my dispensary from a patient/employee who must have only recently got a prescription. Was told it would be good for pain and help me sleep... neither are true. It is a good day time strain, not heavy. Uplifting, good if you need to get things done throughout the day.”"
flxoating,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1236513,"“One of my favourites for appetite stimulation. I suffer from depression and anxiety that leaves me not eating as much as I should at times, white walker kush is a great pick me up. Sativa dominants usually create too much commotion in my head and trigger my anxiety, but the WWK is well-rounded and doesn't have this effect.”"

Though the strain was lacking that body buzz I look for, it was an overall nice high that kept me happy and energetic. Thoughts are still present when stoned which puts this strain low on my list. Beware of the extreme munchies, which was mentioned in another comment. The smell is similar to a typical Afghan indica once cured. Overall I would not recommend this strain if you're looki...”"

lionheartghost,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1322969,"“To be confused with whitewalker og. According to the seed companies White Walker Kush is a cross of White Widow and Skywalker Kush. Skywalker Kush is a cross between Skywalker and Og Kush. White Walker Kush should be genetically identical to Whitewalker og with small differences due to phenos. White Walker Kush was just made by a different company most likely to compete.”"
DrNugz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-walker-kush/reviews/1350921,"“This sweet and zesty strain won't leave the curious disappointed but is very flawed. In my experience, repeated use led to creative bursts, followed by laziness. If you play an instrument, this strain is great for improvisation. Other than that and sleeping, it's useless.”"
