rollingman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/master-jedi/reviews/1342021,"“very good taste, not once was it a harsh smoke. Very trippy high (couple mild hallucinations) and afterwards, the uncontrolable laughs. honestly it's without a doubt the best grass i've ever smoked.”"
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/indica/master-jedi/reviews/1372840,"“With three hits from this it tastes woodsy with tea herbs. Very Euphoric and keeps my mind entertained by getting my tasks done.  This is rather unusual warm numbing sensation, although duly noted not to take over 205º C, if you want a smoother smoke. I was feeling a bit bored and sleepy  way to early to go to sleep. I've Had Master Kush and skywalker separate and they are both really great hitters. I'm Doing Master ...”"

Great body high that lasts so very long, great with anxiety, nervousness, etc. Long time patient recommends. Highly.”"
jdogcx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/master-jedi/reviews/1356432,"“This strain has very dense nugs and populated with just the right amount of orange hairs and crystals. Me and a couple buddies smoked 26 blunts of this strain and let me tell you something, we were fucking stoned. The weed gods picked us up by their Hands and took us to nugopolis. Our legs were tingly and numb. I would drift into space for a while and come back for a second. Being in the dark while high off this stra...”"

allinlinden,https://www.leafly.com/indica/master-jedi/reviews/1253363,"“Good Shit! Smells like you woluld expect from a Master Kush x Jedi. Has the Piney scent from the Master and kind of fruity from the Jedi. Great smoke, gets you moderately stoned with good head and body effects. Won't knock you out but will make you lazy.  Just feels nice & mellow. Good indica for later on in the day.”"

Smoked a jay after a very stressful long week and one joint between 5x people was enough to make us all feel uplifted and stress free.

TechnoNshWeed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/master-jedi/reviews/1309120,"“My experience with this particular strain was mostly great. Nugs were a bit brighter than the usual kush colors. The scent was somewhat a mixture of pine, sweetness, and quite pungent. I have experience with one of the parents of this strain, that being Master Kush. And in a way it is very similar to that strain. The onset of the high comes on slower than most indicas. Your body will start to feel more relaxed as the...”"

By comparison, this was not as potent overall, and definitely more head than body which surprised me for an Indica.  Also found this an especially harsh vape.  High was decent and enjoyable, but not what I look for in a good Indica.”"

Could see this as a daytime bud (with small doses) but also a nice chill out at end of the day buzz with a bit more.  Would not hesitate to purchase again!”"

Tasted so much lighter than it smelled.  Really tasty. Sweet, piney and citrusy to me.   After about 15 mins I got kinda shakey feeling and that's now transpired into a warm buzzy feeling in my body.
