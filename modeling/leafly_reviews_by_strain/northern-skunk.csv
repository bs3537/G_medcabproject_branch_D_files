DxVendetta,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/northern-skunk/reviews/1417423,"“I smoked Northern Lights Skunk (labeled for me 'NLX Skunk', and this Northern Skunk seems to be the closest to it for review). I woke up in pain from my back and hips which is pretty severe most days, I used NLX Skunk to medicate for the first time. I waited for the effects to kick in which took only a few minutes and my pain started to dissipate very quickly and it didn't put me on couch lock. I have plenty of energ...”"

High Frequency Farms -

THCA 24.3%

CANNABINOID TOTAL: 24.3%

Immediately upon smelling this strain for the first time, my curiosity arose. I couldn't help but sniff the bag multiple times. Excellent aroma. I could definitely smell a skunkiness but the flower also had a nice piny citrusy dash of pungency. 

This is a nice bud for a day off or an evening after a hard day's work. On my current...”"

Cmunz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/northern-skunk/reviews/1386589,"“A Sensi classic, heavy hitting hybrid. 26% on my grow, centerfold worthy buds- fluffy and frosted. Aromatic of sweet- sour mango cocoa annd a touch of mint (it tastes like weed, these are nuances). Devoid of skunk smell despite the moniker. Hybrid comes true on the effects with heavy body high yet cerebral effect great for music or classic movies. Within the hour sleep takes over then munchies . Cheezits and peanut b...”"

It is the perfect blend of a 50/50 that you can get. Great for evening, watching tv and relaxing, and then when you are ready to doze off, you sleep blissfully the whole night with no drowsy after-effects the next morning. I am totally in love with this strain..”"

Eases depression and anxiety and yet allows me to get shit done. Fully cerebral and physical at the same time. I stay chilling on their Northern Skunk. This strain never gets boring!  Works great for nausea.”"

Can't wait until I get my hands on some Northern Skunk concentrate....”"

ElGonzito,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/northern-skunk/reviews/1386592,"“great strain that leaves you relaxed but not super couch locked like a heavy indica leaves you but it is more indica dominant. It smells GREAT its earthy with a strong skunk aroma. I got a gram of it and it is a couple small but really dense nugs. it started out pretty euphoric and heady but after a bit it went to couchlock. overall great strain and a new fave.”"

Scirzo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/northern-skunk/reviews/1284831,"“This one delivers a clear-minded stoned. I deliberately call it a 'stoned' and not a 'high'. It definitely works on you body and the head. Sounds sound heavy, light has texture and touch hums and scents are thick. The strain almost as a minty taste at first, then herbal and earthy. That taste lasted throughout. I vape my herbs with the Arizer Air on blue until it stops delivering. There doesn't seem to be much in the...”"
Jtucson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/northern-skunk/reviews/1606564,"“Northern Skunk is by far my favorite strain I have come across. It always varies a little batch to batch but I found it to be the most consistent and very potent. It is a great saturday night smoke that can put you in a relaxed but coherent state. It is easy to be social and function on but at the same time, really helps anxiety and depression. Very uplifting!”"

It's definitely a skunk, very pungent. And the smoke is acrid and makes me cough no matter how small a draw I take. I wasn't expecting that and it makes me wonder if that's a feature of skunks.

The first time I tried it, it was alright. Mild paranoia, moderate euphoria, mild disassociation. I...”"
