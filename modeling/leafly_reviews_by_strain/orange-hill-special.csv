GlorbinShlorbin0,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-hill-special/reviews/1667322,"“Overall an excellent strain. I personally prefer this strain for evening tokes as I find the comedown to be rather debilitating, as when I choose this strain for the morning/afternoon I cant help but just want to sleep afterward.”"

Strong strain, with a lovely sweet citrus smell , Not for everyone during day time, but great for night time , OHS is so sweet that I always smoke until I feel something like slight head stretching/ expanding feelings 🙂”"
drewbysnacks,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-hill-special/reviews/1351406,"“Great strain!!! First puff and i got a full body buzz. I also coughed my ass of. LOL! It has a very nice taste (more fruity, less piney) and a long lasting buzz. I would say that it's not as much a "let's go seize the day" but is more of a "I'm never leaving this couch" buzz. Enjoy!”"

I feel relaxed and my anxiety from stress has really calmed down. Good to smoke before bed. I got a great night sleep and actually feel rested. Thumbs up from me!”"
