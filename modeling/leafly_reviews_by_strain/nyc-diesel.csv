Rufskinking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nyc-diesel/reviews/1412509,"“A clear relative to Sour Diesel, this strain has a strong stench but a contradicting light aromatic burn. Personally it makes me FUCKING HORNY, but other benefits include peaceful, tranquil, and calming effects. Try new things while using this strain, music, movies, theater, art. Go for a walk in the park. Will not make you paranoid, just dizzy ;-)”"

The trichome production on this strain was outragous. The scent and taste is very piney and the smoke is really smooth. The high is a very uplifting sativa that puts you in a good mood and gave me a great deal of motivation for the day. There is almost no trace of body high in this strain, so if you're looking for the exclusive mental e...”"

I just changed my mind 12 times in 8 seconds. May have broken the land/speed/mind fuck barrier....Must of smoked too much NYC Diesel. Like a Mobb Boss (not as focused) with a tinge of a haze/dream effect. It does taste like I am doing bong rips at the gas pump.”"

Stand out effects were euphoria and major arousal. Also, I'm not sure if this will be an isolated incident but I had NO MUNCHIES. I actually felt more full and even when fast food commercials came on (usually an instant catalyst to major munchies) I had no desire to eat. I'll have to see if this re...”"

I would probably smoke it towards the end of the day. It did make me a bit paranoid, not a huge amount but enough to make me not want to smoke it and go do stuff. Made me very inward- thinking a lot to myself and creative in that way.”"
Schiz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nyc-diesel/reviews/1085312,"“This is a staple, for those who can find it readily.  Dark purple, skunky, and smoky in flavour.  Very good for pain and headaches, but it makes you scatterbrained (moreso than many other strains, anyway).”"

Picked up a $25 eigth (3.5g) and although the buds didn't smell too disely they did have a distict  nyc-disel taste. Wouldn't purchase again unless buds were improved.”"
