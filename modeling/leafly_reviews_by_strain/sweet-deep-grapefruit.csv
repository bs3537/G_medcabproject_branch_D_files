cccofme,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-deep-grapefruit/reviews/1381415,"“This is a 5 star winner all the way. As a grower it had 2 phenotypes, 2 were indica and the other sativa leaning. The flowers are covered in trichomes and it has a very strong odor (think skunky fruit) excellent and smooth when properly cured, the buzz is heavy in the head and the body follows after. Not the longest buzz in the world but so excellent in quality, just use some more.. Only downside, major cottonmouth.”"
BernieSanders,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-deep-grapefruit/reviews/1415091,"“A flower decadently adored with a flavour akin to that of Sour Grape. This particular vein of Mary is a taste worth investigating a gram of, even to the most discriminatory of palates.”"
Randya,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-deep-grapefruit/reviews/1416045,"“SDG is a nice mellow strain. It will relax your mind for sure. Lasted about a good hour and a half and started fading out. Once it fades you will just want to go to bed. The cut I had tasted more like grapefruit. Make sure you have a lot of water or whatever you drink as you will have severe dry mouth.”"
Caned-and-unable,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-deep-grapefruit/reviews/1591632,"“Very nice! A great strain for end-of-the-day relaxation and pain. Slight cerebral stimulation to start with, then a long, satisfying, relaxing body stone and calming of the mind. Works wonders for post operative pain (I'm currently recuperating for surgery) and arthritic pain (my wife uses this strain for this reason). It has an unusual, but not unpleasant aroma; reminiscent of grapefruit peel and tyre smoke with hin...”"

Looked like a 2 pound monster till 2 days of manicuring then it was only half the size. Dried for 10 days gave it another manicure and smelled some hints of grapefruit. Jared it for 3 days opened it up and smelled like sour grass so I gave it one last trim an put it back in the jars. A few days later I ...”"
Freakazoid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-deep-grapefruit/reviews/1286269,"“Very relaxing but still uplifting high. Great Taste and pretty good for gettin Creative. For a Indica still very uplifting!
It is nearly the perfect middle of Indica and Sativa for my opinion.
Not even the best for Sleep but it works. Also not so bad for gettin rid
of Benzodiazepines. But only for the Day what the Medical usage belongs.”"
Consistent,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-deep-grapefruit/reviews/1237646,"“I love this strain Sweet Deep Grapefruit!
I Strongly recommend smoking this strain all day. After a long day of smoking this strain you will fall into an amazing snooze.
Fantastic!”"
blackwaterkrow,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-deep-grapefruit/reviews/1238543,"“I grew this strain along with dinafem's power kush.  The pheno Sgf displayed was more blueberry, close internodes, and stayed short with a dense flower structure.  Dark blue/green leaves with orange hairs. After 2 months of curing it has a sweet cheese/sour citrus smell. I vegged for 23 days and flowered for 58 days. 
   On the exhale you get burnt citrus with earthy undertones.  The high is slow but gradual. Starts ...”"

TimBean,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-deep-grapefruit/reviews/1196070,"“I love this strain. I've grown it outside a few times, and have had great success with it. Dense green buds with orange hairs. A good yielder. I get more of an acidic taste with it. Some say it tastes like pineapple or grapefruit. It finishes early, usually by oct 1. Sometimes a little earlier.”"
ganjaguru11,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-deep-grapefruit/reviews/1219151,"“very good smoke. I feel this strain is suited for a good anytime smoke but will put you to sleep if you smoke on it all day! which isn't bad at all! smells of a dank fruity bag of hash haha! cheers!”"

the high itself i personally didn't like it, i was in a deep conversation with myself, witch in some way people like that , i didn't enjoy that much personall...”"

RumbleBud,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-deep-grapefruit/reviews/1591285,"“My area may be an outlier, but I haven't gotten much quality out of this strain. The bud I've gotten has been mediocre at best, even off of plants I have grown myself. Mostly woody flavor, I'd pass on this one.”"
