StaySpacey,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/megalodon/reviews/1385630,"“Received 2 g of this at a local dispensary as a freebie with purchase. I rarely dabble with Sativas but the name sold me and plus it looked Amazing! Dark lime green  flowers absolutely covered in white crystals. It smelled like skunky lemon wafers to me. I took a few bong rips on a rainy afternoon and 5 minutes later, I felt very anxious and was honestly thinking it had been laced with something. It was so Speedy, I ...”"
BeautTee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/megalodon/reviews/1389756,"“Megalodon alleviates Pain.  Paired up with another comparable Strain makes Megalodon the most Superior Strain offered by Pot Cargo (ie. adding Purple Afghan); such that you smoke those two strains separately to optimize on each strain's flavor and unique characteristics.  Megalodon is Earthy with a True Herbal Taste, Classic Marijuana with a Higher THC content without it is all the heady-high, and body stone is mild....”"

timura,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/megalodon/reviews/1552106,"“I have never bought 14 grams of weed before in one go for $80 CAD. But I suffer from depression, and after doing a few months of anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medication (escitalopram), and therapy/counselling, and now this baby. I tend to think a lot, and I am an optimist. It gives me very utopian thinking and creativity. I would recommend caution for people with extra anxiety, because it's not easy to control it aw...”"

Smoking it; uplifting, clears my mind, picks me up and gives me some energy.  Makes me smile and feel like dancing. It doesn't take a lot to start feeling it. I try to take it easy as I've read that it can kick start anxiety a little, but I haven't experienced it myself. 

This strain is most def savoury. The flavours are good for sm...”"

The high is energetic mixed with some creative thought bursts, but make sure you have your favourite snacks ready to rock and roll!!”"

Look up its parent strains and youl notice there's not 2 but 3 making Megladon a mega hybrid or Clone only strain 5hat will open a can of Whoptoshie on yer ass.The only fucking drawback if there is one is you might get all messed up and leave a review like this one.”"

dsafire,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/megalodon/reviews/1527590,"“If you find most sativas too racy, try this one! Wiped the ruminating right out without sleepiness, on first try. Its kinda stoney, focus is achievable with a bit of will. I usually avoid sativas, but will try this if it pops up again at the dispensary, 

must see if the stoniness can be adjusted to.

Burgerpurse,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/megalodon/reviews/1776659,"“what a strain! it smells very skunky but tastes lovely and woodsy. the effects creep up on you (10-20 mins.) and it not only melts pain completely away gives you almost hyper focus and calm. I greatly enjoyed listening to some instrumental music and doing some creative writing while feeling the blissful effects of this monster strain. Definitely reccomend if you are having severe pain or depression, however it is qui...”"
HOSPiTAL,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/megalodon/reviews/1694888,"“Megaladon was my first sativa, and a great introduction. I initially had problems as it initially took smoking it a couple times for it to really sit with me well, but after it did it put me in a wonderful mood. Though I would never use this daily, I highly recommend it for couples as it has very arousing effects.”"

Zombiefreak,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/megalodon/reviews/1741018,"“Hands down my favorite Sativa of all time. It tastes delicious, reminds me of a good tea, not too over powering so I'd never get sick of the taste and it's so powerful even half a gram and I'm full of energy and good vibes for the day”"
DeleteriousDon,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/megalodon/reviews/1456828,"“From a functional perspective, I have never before found a strain that was so nice to deal with - while grinding and rolling the bud was not at all sticky.  It had a very slight feel of maybe an oil or equal coating on it, but whatever was the difference, it really didn't seem to affect the process of enjoyment.

The smoke going in was more harsh than I like though.  I'm not a fan of compulsive coughing after a toke....”"
TheGreatOG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/megalodon/reviews/1464209,"“I found this strain very relaxing and euphoric with a sweet kind of earthy taste. However, in my case, once I smoked Megalodon for a few weeks at a time (probably about a month or so,) i started gaining a strong tolerance to the point that i would add batch for a higher concentrated high (not proud about that at all.) I rated it 4 stars simply because the more i smoked this particular strain, the more i gained a quic...”"
