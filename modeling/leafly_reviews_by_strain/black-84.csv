Very fruity with grape being the dominant scent.  Both times I have smoked this, I became sleepy, which was exactly why I purchased it.  It does the trick, and also gave me a sense of calm and happiness.  I really enjoy everything about this flower.  Its beautiful, smells great, and is a fantastic Indica.”"

schmo.greene,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-84/reviews/1166788,"“My new night time sleep inducer. Just purchased this from Have a Heart Cafe in Seattle yesterday and is my new fav indica today. Great strain in glass bowls because of the great taste. Been smoking for years now and it takes a lot to knock me to sleep but after a few sessions with this strain, GOODNIGHT.”"
BudleyMokaBo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-84/reviews/1260544,"“This is one of my very favorite indica stains; it's a very relaxing, de-stressing, and tasty strain. Great for a mellow Sunday afternoon on the couch or a late night treat to send you off to restful sleep. This is fairly strong stuff that makes whatever you're doing enjoyable, so long as it can be done in the prone position -- which is exactly where you'll end up; the batch I'm currently smoking is 30.4% Total Cannab...”"

BernieSanders,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-84/reviews/1219872,"“A very nice smoke, my partner and I regard it as 'the coffee' of marijuana. A nice after dessert smoke. 'Pleasant' is really the only way I regard this bud.”"

labia,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-84/reviews/1282963,"“Fire Indica! Not sure how I hadn't heard of this strain before, but wow the high is definitely up there with the best. Very stoney, couch lock, pain relieving high that just gets more intense over the course of ten minutes or so before settling in. Top 10 favorite.”"

Sean420guy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-84/reviews/1247522,"“Found this as UW Black and impressed on how strong this little indicia strain actually is. Earthy-Woody taste with a piney aroma, super relaxing for both mind & body. At first it was a bit harsh but as it burns it mellows out, personally I found it best topped with a bit of rich wax/oil and it quickly went to "lights out".”"
BakedinTacoma,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-84/reviews/1205358,"“I got this strain due to the high THC content (24%). The flavor is not the best, but the head high is good.”"

broskimarley,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-84/reviews/1169071,"“Real heavy stuff, but great if you're just trying to crash after a long day. It has a lemony taste to it too. Definitely something I'd buy again.”"
