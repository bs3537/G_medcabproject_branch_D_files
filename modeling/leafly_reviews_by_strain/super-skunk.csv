I was able to get some massive vape hits using my Pax on the highest setting.  It gives you a nice cerebral head high with a mellow body stone.  Food tastes extra amazing, and sex is extra incredible.  Super Skunk's effects are pretty long lasting.  A feeling of contentment washes over you and the stresses on your mind melt away. Medically it's good at taking a...”"

This strain comes on fast and is noticably much more potent than the pure indicas i've mainly been smoking recently. If your prone to anxiety or racing thoughts this is a strain I'd avoid, but if you like a powerful THC punch you will love Super Skunk!”"
