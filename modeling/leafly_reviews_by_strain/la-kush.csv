LA Kush

ktb224,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/la-kush/reviews/1149132,"“I got a little bit of this from Walking Raven and it's fantastic. Even though it's like 85% indica, it doesn't make me tired at all, just relaxed and happy. It  also doesn't make me anxious either, it's perfect. 

I've been able to clean, get work done etc. after smoking this, but have also been able to just sit and relax. I wish I would have gotten more. Definitely one of my all time favorites.”"
SafetyLast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/la-kush/reviews/1298542,"“This does everything weed has been described by someone who never used it. I hardly ever had the combination of FX before, but those were haze's, not 80% Indica's. a spliff with this and some white widow got me super stoned. It also got me seeing a red orby-thingy, which my eyes followed like a cat follows a laser pointer. KUSH is quite rare here, and this is the first one I ever had. Really great strain for just bei...”"

agkush89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/la-kush/reviews/1606308,"“I've tried this strain several times and every time it seems to bring on anxiety and even mild panic attacks. It's during the onset of the high that can last anywhere from 5 - 30 minutes. Afterwards, I'm generally relaxed but get very much in my head. For me, I guess it's just better to take a hit or two and leave it at that. Some Sativa heavy plants tend to do this, so be forewarned when trying this if you've had si...”"

rups,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/la-kush/reviews/1227155,"“Bought at '1ste Hulp', Amsterdam. Very good hybrid. Uplifted, giggly high with a relaxing Indica-like body experience. Ideal strain if you want to get some work done (not physically demanding).
Coordination is a bit off sometimes, complex tasks may seem slightly overwhelming. Not very strong visuals but strong auditive experience.”"

schuffy88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/la-kush/reviews/1193662,"“Overall sick bud. More of a never-ending  uplifting high but still nice body-relaxing/pain relieving effects. Has a funky nutty note to it but smokes with a cool menthol-like taste and scent of strawberries.”"

1kushking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/la-kush/reviews/1608945,"“Los Angeles Kush did well again with LA Kush. My eighth was beautiful to look at. One bud alone weighed 2.5 grams! The bud had two different shades, medium to darker green that looked much lighter because of all the fine clear trichomes & burnt orange pistils everywhere. Buds super dense. The taste & smell i got was that of pine. The effects made me VERY happy and then VERY relaxed. An uplifted body high. What you ex...”"

THEphillygirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/la-kush/reviews/1159963,"“Felt more like a saliva than indica. Was able to carry on a fun, pleasant convo and really enjoyed the primarily head high (with a tinge of tingle in my toes) UNTIL the unbearable dry mouth came on. Seriously one of the worst I have experienced.”"

My favorite strain is Bertberry cookies 
I love that Bertberry is the best tasting sativa I've tried in a while 
I love the fact that is so sticky and it's not dry And does not crumble like sandy weed
I love how dank it is the smell is definitely on the best I sativas”"
