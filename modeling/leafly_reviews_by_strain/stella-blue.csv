I'm prone to anxiety with strong sativas and tend to prefer hybrids, or else have to throw in a pinch of some indica to chill it out. Stella Blue is great by itself. It's a mellow, focused high that will perk you right up and make you want to do stuff. If you're not quite sure what to smoke and are worried the wrong choice will derail your plans, go with this one....”"
