I picked up this strain at $10 for a gram of their exotics because it just looked top notch, and I mean look at its lineage. You can’t go wrong.

I vaped on this with the MigVapor Sub Herb at 22 watts. One small vape bowl and I was at a solid 8/10 within ten minutes from the first pull. Full body warmth and r...”"

The high left nothing to be desired. Well balanced between body and mind. Found myself spacing out trying to order a sandwich much to the chagrin of the sandwich maker. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars.”"

Was recommended by my budtender but, I actually went to purchase this strain, based on the reviews left here. I must say... I’m VERY impressed! Great, mellow, balanced high. ZAPPED my nausea in an instant and, relaxed me from head to toe. All of my pain melted away. (I was about a 7/10 pain scale, pre-smoke) I felt amazing after just a few moments. 15 minutes later, I’m about a 2/10, zero nausea and, in ...”"

jetpackjotto,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-tahoe-cookies/reviews/1608772,"“White Tahoe Cookies has become my current favorite hybrid indica strain. I picked up some flower of this bud a week ago and the potency is unmatched. A little quickly goes a long way, which I always appreciate.

The high is a heavy one, consuming your body with relief and a bit of tingly feeling. The head high is mostly euphoric and relaxing. Great for melting away stress at any time of the day.”"

I love it”"

Worthy of trying again; but its a Sativa to me. 

Backstory:
