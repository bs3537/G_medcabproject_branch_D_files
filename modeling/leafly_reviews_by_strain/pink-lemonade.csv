tilldeathfitness93,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-lemonade/reviews/1355722,"“Awesome-ass, strain. Picked up an ounce at the new Commencement Bay Cannabis shop in Fife, WA off of I-5 on my way home from work. Rolled a blunt as soon as I got home (after taking my dog out) and damn...creeper but probably one of the most relaxing, energetic strains I've ever inhaled.”"

Over all a very nice clean head high. There was a little bit of energy but what sealed the deal is it kills stress and anxiety....completely. This strain puts you in a very positive mood, with positive thoughts.  This is definitely a new favorite that is staying on my list!”"
Frogstar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-lemonade/reviews/1355725,"“It works immediately and helps with deep depression. Lifts me out of my worst moods. It also gives a huge boost to energy and is great to hit before a cleaning binge.

Superb for those with a history of anxiety or depression.”"

You immediately taste lemon and get a very spikey citrus flavor after. The effect is uplifting and happy. Didn't last long though. 2 hours, but my tolerance is high. This is a great strain.”"
umopapisdn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-lemonade/reviews/1326575,"“Pink lemonade has recently become one of my favorite strains to ever try. The smell is a very pronounced citrus and of course lemonade. The flavor is phenomenal very bright and smooth. I notice a nice mind buzz but the body high is amazing, not too powerful that I want to do nothing but enough that everything fells exciting. My anxiety is almost completely gone with this strain!

I would definitely recommend trying t...”"

TonyRedbones,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-lemonade/reviews/1425924,"“Not sure I would label this one as daytime meds. I immediately felt like laying down. Would not consider the high to be very balanced. In-da couch, I'm in-da bed. 😂👌 Not tired, super relaxed, little tension in the head from a high that can't seem to fully express it's self from too much of a relaxing affect.”"
idkaybictp,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-lemonade/reviews/1312000,"“Hits you like a kick in the head but not long lasting.  This bud was tasty.  One whiff and you know in your heart why they call it pink lemonade.  The taste is a sweet citrus.  The high is energetic very up, the kind of weed you can smoke in the morning with your coffee and then head off to your responsibilities without worrying about being foggy and spacey.”"
