Uplifting head high at first, then 5-10 minutes later settles into something really nice, relaxing, happy, and very clearheaded and not Stoney. Found myself just kind of taking a sigh of relief and blissed out on life. Quick relief to back pain and symptoms of PTSD. No couch lock either, very motivated. Found myself tidying up around the house, doing dishes, finishing some yard work I had been putti...”"
Ringy01,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/royal-highness/reviews/1356368,"“Great strain for people who suffer with anxiety, i usually get uncomfortable with higher thc strains but could smoke this all day, very nice clear headedness and relaxed vibes. Also if you smoked a high thc strain and felt panic or paranoid royal highness seems to bring you backdown nicely. Totally recommend this”"

I didnt know what expect from a medical strain, I didnt have the idea of what expect from1:1 cbd:thc ratio strain. 2 hits in a bong, just sat in a nice chair, turned on the radio with nice reggae music, and I just felt.

Dude, what a nice strain.

In the first 30 sec, an uplift high came, head high, no cou...”"

pdxpandacub,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/royal-highness/reviews/1296422,"“I'm usually an Indica smoker but upon much recommendation from the budtenders at my neighborhood dispensary, I decided to give this a try. I love it! Flavors are delicious, sweet and berry like. The high is well balanced--calming, relaxed, happy, euphoric, uplifted... Give it a try, you won't regret it.”"

Strange flavors 
Awesome buzz”"
pdxpaul,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/royal-highness/reviews/1514793,"“Usually I'm a high-THC person, so I wasn't expecting to feel much off this strain. After one bowl, though, I am feeling very nicely buzzed. Just the right amount of stoney feeling and none of couchlock. Great for doing some morning or day chores around the house. Would also recommend for those THC-users looking to explore high-CBD strains.”"
Aeroloth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/royal-highness/reviews/1523990,"“This is my first time trying a cbd strain, and I am very pleased. The high is quick to settle in, but it’s very pleasant. I took one very large hit on my bong to get a feel for it. The flavor is very interesting. I get some earthy flavors, and I kind of get what they mean by a cheesy taste/smell. The buds are dense with plenty of orangeish hairs and crystals to spare. It’s pretty fragrant to begin with, but when you ...”"
AnneVonRose,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/royal-highness/reviews/1326716,"“The best strains I've ever had in my life! Instantly defeats my pain and migraines. For me I don't really get a high which is perfect for me I don't enjoy just getting stoned. Anyway I am saddened to hear the strain will be disappearing soon if it hasn't already. I'm definitely in love with this strain!”"

Jonasbrother,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/royal-highness/reviews/1745480,"“Excellent strain. Very relaxing. Smoked it with a pipe and it just gave me a good mood, a sort of couch lock, but if you want to take a walk you can do it. Will definitely buy it again.”"

Jack_P,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/royal-highness/reviews/1754383,"“Oh my God, I love this strain. I struggle with anxiety (and associated muscle tension), depression, and anger management. This strain is a godsend for relaxing, clear-thinking daytime uplift that helps defuse me and relaxes my muscle tension. It gives me that slightly stoney feeling that everything is going to be ok while letting me get thoughtful work done. That and I just love the skunky terpene profile and how pre...”"

Baby listen! I've only had 3 bong hits so far and I'm about to cream my panties it's so good.

no headache, no body pain, I'm super chill, but not sleepy. I feel mentally alert but not stressed. think of a marriage between prozac, xanax & Adderall... yep, that's what it feels like. So, if you'll excuse me, I am about to cook a Thank...”"

I wake up refreshed and never groggy or sluggish.  There's a nice, relaxing high in there somewhere, but I'm off to dreamland before I can fully experience it.”"

Stoysus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/royal-highness/reviews/1235328,"“I finally found this today and it was on a fire sale too so double bonus. This newer strain is worth it. I was very uplifted but high as hell. Phew she has a punch. Got the laughs w the wife and we had fun. Great anytime smoke. But prob not if you need to interact with the inlaws in the next few hours after smoking. Hits me between the red eyes.”"
