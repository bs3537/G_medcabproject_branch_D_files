Killer Queen
=============
pdoane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/killer-queen/reviews/1369519,"“Killer Queen hits your head, forehead and eyes very hard.  Your arms and body will likely pulse with a euphoric rush.  Increased auditory focus.  Able to write and follow thought patterns/instructions physically – mind and body are still connected.  The soothing cerebral effects give way to heavy eyelids and a slight draining feeling towards the end.  This is a moderate come down.”"
