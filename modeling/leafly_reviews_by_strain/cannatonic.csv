Cannatonic
=============
Krshna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1417966,"“Cannatonic is a very unique strain, from my experience. I usually smoke THC dominant bud, whether it be a heavy Indica or a daytime Sativa. This is true medicinal marijuana, though. Cannatonic has very little psychoactive effect. For some, that is a negative, but for some it is a major and strain defining positive.

This certainly isn't recreational weed. It isn't going to get you stoned or high. This is just pure ...”"
Narpet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1417967,"“I've been using Cannatonic for over 2 years now. It's the perfect medicine for me. I initially used it for relief of my migraines. It does a great job with that. A couple of hits from my vaporizer, and the migraine is stopped. I used to have a minimum of 1 migraine a week... now I have had about 3 migraines in 2 years.

I also found that it helped with my anxiety, and I have completely gone off of meds that I used fo...”"
HappilyPainFree,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1410813,"“Strain is so good for pain relief during the day when I have a a lot of number crunching to do (programming C++). It is the equivalent to having my thoughts put on a pair of glasses and the mind shifts focus. At the same time you are not all "Psychoactived" up. 

I hope more 1:1 strains will appear. It is clearly beneficial for us who don't like to be "high" just for the pain relief. I'm sure if I take a megadose I'd...”"
CBD_Lady,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1417970,"“This is my go-to for anxiety and PTSD. I can maintain my energy levels, while grounding myself. Makes me feel more connected to the world, instead of my usual routine of mentally floating around. Best of all, I become more functional and focused.”"

THC = .7%
CBD = 16.7%

I have major issues with hypertension, anxiety, depression, degenerative joints/cartilage (and the inflammation and pain that goes along with it).

Cannatonic is the only available medication that is high CBD and low THC within my state.  It's the CBD that actively makes me feel healthier and happier, even when it's not in my system.  The effects continue on even after use, as t...”"

My favorite far and above is Blue Jay Way, (not yet listed on Leafly.com) a close second is Cannatonic from Goddess Delivers, Hollywood. Smoking Cannatonic flower has a stimulating and focusing effect for me while calming my anxiety and reducing pain from Cerebral Palsy. It is a good daytime medication, because I remain alert while at ease and can carry on with my day.

At night I take...”"
NautiDreams,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1410814,"“Cannatonic, what an absolutely beautiful medicine. For those seeking pain relief and mental focus without the psychoactive feeling in the brain then Cannatonic will be an excellent choice for you.  With its 50/50 hybrid nature ADD/ADHD patients will praise Cannatonic for its ability to let you focus on anything at hand. To those patients suffering from Anxiety you will greatly appreciate its ability to even you out w...”"
RaoulDuke710,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1415002,"“Always been a huge favorite. As a chronic pain and seizure patient this strain knocks all that out with it's enormous 15% CBD count. Low on the THC side usually between 7% and 13% so if you're going for something heady this isn't for you. If you are uncomfortable with feeling "high" but would still like to try to benefit from cannabis this would be a strain for you to start with.”"
gangagal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1412323,"“This has got to be the most medicinal products out there. With a 28 to 1 ratio CBD to THC, cannatonic sets the bar for other CBD strains. Use alone or mixed with other strains to add THC, either way, cannatonic is awesome. 

I've seen people who couldn't walk apply sublingually apply cannatonic CO2 and begin walking within five minutes. I know a girl who began taking cannatonic and after a month her doctor said she w...”"
BigRedGrowGuy420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1414911,"“This is a high-quality strain. Great medicinal value. Excellent tasting, Haze dominant. I smoked my sample and that is not the best way to utilize CBD in our bodies. No psychoactive effect you simply just feel fine. It's pretty cool. If you are a medical patient, check it out. Recreationally, this probably isn't what you are looking for but keep in mind rec users, CBD is a great alternative to Tylenol, aspirin, or ac...”"

LilFoot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1395493,"“One of the only strains with high CBD that you can smoke without feeling "medicated". I love it, use it for MIGRANES or when you want pain relief without smoking a lot!”"

It smells like a hairy man's asshole, but it works SOOOO good for pain relief.  It smells awful, but if you can get passed it, you'll learn to love it.

I have HCV, and this is the first strain in my four years of being a cannabis patient that has FULLY eased my symptoms. It has been a true godsend. Cannatonic allows me to carry on, and get through my day (with 0% anxiety). If you are looking for relief and have yet to find it through other varieties, this is definitely the one to try. It will not leave...”"

I purchased it two different times from SPARC in SF, which tests for THC/CBD and shows it on the package.  The first batch said 16.8% CBD to 6.8% THC, the second batch was 16% CBD and only 1% THC!

Lower THC plus high CBD allows me to get high to my comfort level as well as reaping the medical benefits. Recommend to light weight smokers.”"
steenug,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1347606,"“One of the best strains for purely medical reasons. 

This is a working man's strain, from my experience. Something to medicate yourself with, without the fear of being cloudy in the head and unable to do projects. 

If anything, this strain is so soothing to general pain and anxiety, I feel like productivity goes WAY UP after smoking.”"

I have desperately trying to find something that allows me to feel in control of my head but takes away nausea and anxiousness. I've tried many edibles, tinctures, patches. Most of which were either too strong in THC or didn't help at all. I was really afraid to smoke again. Well....I'm now mad I didn't try it earlier....”"

It eliminates my back pain and dulls fire in my wrists. My fingers quit aching after one small hit. I will update my review when I know how it goes with my RLS. This flower is also good for RLS. You don't get so much high, it just takes away pain and the jumpies. RLS=Restless Leg Syndrome.”"
ceresmary206,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1377998,"“for ME, again specific for ME, this plant has been the best for balancing pain, spasticity, insomnia, nausea and inflammation.  The taste of this flower does not send me to the bathroom (it's a very gentle smoke), or affect my asthma.  It leaves me inspired and relaxed, which does not seem to happen with straight Indica strains.”"
starh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1347607,"“Great for a functioning high. I don't feel much head high or typical "stoned" feelings, but that is a-ok when I need to do school or clean house. It's mostly helpful for my anxiety and stress. Helps some with my pain as well. This is my go to when I don't want to feel high at all, but need the medicinal benefits.”"

sndgan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cannatonic/reviews/1366834,"“My favorite strain thus far. A notably high in CBD strain. The THC/CBD ratio is apparently 1:1. Smoking will get me just a touch high and vaping (using the mflb) won't. Getting high is not the priority for this strain. The main 
benefits are simply relaxation and a slight feeling of happiness. This is the type of strain that will not debilitate you; the kind you could take before going to class.”"

Both were relaxing and extremely mellow, with just the right mix of high and physical comfort. I can't recommend this strain more highly, particularly when you're feeling stressed.”"

This gave me too much high to be the one (see ACDC for that).  However, the high is pleasant and not too strong.  If you have a higher thc tolerance than I do you might not even notice it.

I think this gets me a little more stoned than I'd like to be during the  day. Harlequin seems to be a better option (if you can find it!) for patients looking for pain relieve and less of the head high.
