BiggyTalls,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sputnik/reviews/1362646,"“I love Sputnik. It has such a good flavor and keeps me active. It is an intense head high that I really enjoy if I'm going out and doing things. Don't tend to get the munchies or anything on this, but cotton mouth is a factor. Still, the high is great.”"
BluFaso,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sputnik/reviews/1333974,"“One of my favorite strains! I only smoked half a bowl and I was gone. For me it came in stages. It started off with a nice easy mellow high, then all at once hit me in the head and I was on the ground laughing hard asf. After laughing hardcore for like 5 minutes, it left me with a decent head high and super relaxed which was perfect to couch with.”"

It's by far my favorite hybrid strain,  and i love its a sativa dominate.  It make me feel really happy, energetic, and ready to take on the day.  I don't feel any pain in my hip, or lumbar and I'm able to be productive. So i give this a solid 5*****....”"

Sonofabrokenman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sputnik/reviews/1255543,"“2 hits to liftoff. Decent buzz out of the launchpad. mid buzz nice and headize, no burn out at the end. 
good strain to kick back, and rate strains.”"
blinky602,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sputnik/reviews/1254634,"“uplifting high, not too overwhelming like some other sativas. only issue was that god awful taste and smell.”"
emeacham,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sputnik/reviews/1352263,"“When I bought it, I was told it was identical to Casey Jones... I disagree. I smoked it several times, then used the rest to make cookies. I enjoyed it much more in the cookies than in my pipe... I think I might try it again the next time I see it.”"
blackish420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sputnik/reviews/1256987,"“I'm not an indica fan, so I'm already based. but either way, I'll give it it's due. not a strain I would get, but I'm a top shelf kinda guy, but after a while, it's worth the money if ur in a pinch”"
