It makes you feel like you are crawling into a grilled cheese bed of warm gooey cheesy sheets of goodness with toasty bread blankets. Then 9 hours later you awake from what feels like hibernation perfectly rested with zero haziness. 

I am all but non functional within 20 minutes of smoking one bowl so be prepared for bed when you enjoy some Scooby snacks!”"

The mysterious thing is how the hell did it get its name? The nugs I had were small but frosty and pungent.
