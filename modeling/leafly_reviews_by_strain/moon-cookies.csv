Rock hard nugs hit smooth and full, pungent pine and sweet doughy earth...def features the Kushy side of GSC...reminiscent of Girl Scout Master.

Anyone who loves GSC's must try this. Basically its all the goodness fun relaxation and socialness that this strain offers ^2 . Beware this creeps up on u especially if ur smoking alone.

Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/moon-cookies/reviews/1372781,"“Brilliant strain.  Happiness in a flower.  Creeps up on you, but then warms your mind with euforia and a relaxed feeling that isn't sedative.  Though after a few hours you are ready to sleep.  Moderate body effects coupled with the mental up tick, make it all encompassing and fairly powerful, in a very good way.”"
