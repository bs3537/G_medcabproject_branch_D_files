Had gotten some of this from a wonderful delivery service here in Arizona, and the flower honestly surpassed my expectations on how it would turn out to feel, smell, look, taste, and smoke like. Anybody looking for a great overall strain, definitely turn to this one!”"

reyashtoos,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-dog-shit/reviews/1201687,"“Tried the Dog Shit about half an hour ago. Pretty quick to lift off, but still seems more like an indica that has a slight head high than a true sativa (which is what my dispensary had it labeled). The initial buzz stopped quickly and the after effects leave me feeling mellow and upbeat.  Interesting stuff.”"
