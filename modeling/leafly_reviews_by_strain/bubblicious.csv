I suffer from IBS Big time! This stuff is great for pain relief specifically in the abdomen region. it heals more than that but for my purposes it's fantastic for what I suffer. This gets rid of the pain entirely and brings me into another galaxy!

It is unremarkable at first, but a second after exhale there is a definite intense sweet flavor. I can see how this strain would be good for depression or anxiety because about 2 minutes after smoking I was embraced by a long lasting feeling of calm upbeat relaxation. Nausea was also soothed, with some appetite boost. I'd say this is better ...”"

It definitely a great one for if you're in a bad mood or need a stress reducer. It's an indo Dom hybrid but it's not a couch locker. Highly recommend this strain. It is sooooooo good!!!”"

This was promised to be Stoney by a budtender in Oregon when I recently went. After opening the package it brought back memories of when I smoked in high school. Smelled like hay and tasted strong.

cccofme,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bubblicious/reviews/1231453,"“It tastes and smells just like pink bubblegum, mostly on the exhale. A very heavy head stone, not one of my fav's as I like higher CBD nighttime for sleep and body pain. I would say it is closer to a 50/50 staying around the middle, at least the phenotype that I just grew. Nice heavy heavily sugared buds, a new fav of hubby's as he loves high THC as a regular all day user.”"

Occasionally as the days get shorter my mood takes on a jaded, slightly pissy Debbie Downer grumpitude expecting things to suck or at least be as is.  And let's face it 5 bucks for a gram is about a 1/25 bet it isn't gonna be heady, but it will smoke.  Occasionally seeds. Puff the whole gram in one sitting ...”"
