Pineapple
=============
SeasideSuicide,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple/reviews/1416929,"“Finding a strain that treats lethargic depression and boosts energy without triggering anxiety or paranoia is a challenge, especially when you're prone to cannabis-induced anxiety.  Enter Pineapple: my current superhero strain. 

Pineapple provides a cheerful, energetic high without the racing thoughts or paranoia of some sativa-dominant strains.   (I get full-blown panic attacks from many strains but this one does n...”"
dlamason,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple/reviews/1416930,"“Quickly moved into my top three strains. I have struggled with Bipolar Depression my entire adult/teen life. This is probably the best strain for snapping me back into a functional state. Very uplifting, very motivating feelings. Sheds the anxiety and any bad vibes that might be bouncing around. This is one I'd like to have in my medicine cabinet at all times”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple/reviews/1413653,"“Pineapple is overall, a very solid strain. To begin, it lives up to it's name and has a very dank and fruity smell. When smoked, it tends to be hover in a median between clean and dirty, but it varies from hit to hit. The high itself is very invigorating and tends to lead one to ingest large amounts of food and get the pulse pumping. The last time I got together with friends to smoke this particular strain we ended u...”"

You smoke enough in one session, your mind's not in Kansas anymore! It really acts like both indica and sativa in a flip-flopping sort of way. Your mind really grows at an exponential rate, creates this sort of "spiral logic" right out of the...”"
Appreciation,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple/reviews/1414342,"“This is the third time I've gotten my hands on it. I wont go in to detail but you only want to get the top shelf quality of this one, it doesn't taste right if it's not cured or dried properly.

It does exactly what it's supposed to, knocking out anxiety & eye pressure & migraines. A very good uplifting head & body high. Not so great on relieving physical aches and pains in your body but good for neck & eye strain & ...”"
jmbishigh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple/reviews/1373737,"“I could socialize, and it treated my sickness of procrastination. If you procrastinate so much it is maladaptive, this is the stuff to get off that stress and start doing things with a smile. I even took a dance class while on this stuff and I killed it.”"
thisbeaidan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple/reviews/1393596,"“I was pleasantly surprised by this strain. I was expecting to be relaxed, but what I received was far more than that - I was giggly, optimistic, and completely out of pain. I suffer from depression, panic attacks, and chronic back pain from an accident. I have never found a strain to work on all three. Higher THC strains tend to make me anxious, and I have developed a tolerance for heavier indica strains. However, th...”"

I was feeling down and demotivated, with a stress hangover, and it was raining off and on.

One vaporized hit - one - of Pineapple invited a much more tropical state of mind.  First impression, smells outrageously deliciou...”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple/reviews/1385879,"“I purchased this as an outdoor strain on 4/20 from a dispensary.  It was the bottomshelf $20 eight.   I was skeptical but I enjoy it.  The high didn't send me into outer space or make me completely stupid.   Very mellow and clear-headed.  I don't how much being sun-grown accounts for this, but I approve.  Also had a great citrusy clean taste.”"
NorthStateToker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple/reviews/1420019,"“Pineapple, on it's own is a pretty weird kind of high. The combination of having a perfectly clear mind while my body is seriously buzzing is totally unlike any other strains I've tried before.

However, I tend to enjoy mixing my strains just to see what different types of a buzz I can engineer. I've discovered that about 80% Pineapple with 20% Blue Dream is a a five star high that is probably the best I've experienc...”"

I smoked some and went to an open mic night, which allowed me to really feel the music and empathize with the performers. Plus someone stepped on my foot and I didn't care at all.

Fugudude,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple/reviews/1410389,"“This stuff smells absolutely amazing and taste just as good. It truly lives up to its name. Definitely recommend this one for the daytime as I find myself greeted with a rush of energy and euphoria. It definitely gets the appetite going and completely and i mean COMPLETELY takes away any stress and/or anxiety you may be having. I will for sure be grabbing more of this stuff in the not too distant future.”"

No paranoia and a overall sense of well being and outgoingness (I found myself dancing more than once at the club we were at - and I don't dance!)

I have PTSD and the anger cycle can be horrible, but one single hit from the vape pen and I'm back to being me. :)  I also get migraines, and this knocks it out with no rebound.  Even coming down is easy and smooth.  Definitely recommended if you also need to medicate in public, but still need to be stealthy and functional.”"

Awesome 50/50 hybrid you don't get super sleepy when you come down, but if you tried to sleep you probably could. You get full head and body high along with munchies.

MsCannaGeek,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple/reviews/1293872,"“I'm smoking on Co2 extract Pineapple and it's delicious !! Though I've medicated with Pineapple with flower in the past. This strain is wonderful indica Dom hybrid. It's real pineapple, tropical punch taste gently lifts you. It defiantly has sativa in there, you feel both body and head high but none of that sativa jolt. This is a peaceful smoke. I would recommend for pain and anxiety (anything).
This can be a day tim...”"

Yolo_Dave,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple/reviews/1255965,"“This strain of bud wasn't all that potent. Physically it really didn't help to take away the pain throughout my entire body but it helped with cutting down on my muscle spasms. Mentally this strain also was on the low side of the euphoric good relaxing feeling I usually feel from smoking really good bud. It did help me relax a little and also made me a bit more talkative too. Plus thank the beautiful Jennifer from Mo...”"

I had many great times while medicating with this flower. Not so much for pain, it takes the edge off though. However it sure does put you in a better mood. I was a little giggly and very much socially stimulated while medicating with this flower. i would definitely recommend for a day time smoke.”"
