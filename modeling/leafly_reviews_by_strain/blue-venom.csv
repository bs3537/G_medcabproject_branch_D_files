I got mines from Seattles Finest at NWCM in White Center (ratcity). Just put it like this...Narcotics. That's the only way I can describe the eurphoria. A dizzying sensational head high with a spaced out stuck on stupid, swear your in deep thought, nodding off, lay ya down, get back up again and raid the fridge, I'm...”"
MrFrugal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-venom/reviews/1330803,"“This is a G13 Labs Strain that I received as a freebie and grew and I have to say it was an excellent strain..I am more a Sativa smoker but this Indica cross of Blueberry and White Widow was an excellent cross..the plant was a typical short indica, but the the Calyxes turned a pretty violet blue color..smoke was really smooth and the high was just right..not to strong..more of a nice creeper..no hangover from what I ...”"
John18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-venom/reviews/1515000,"“I take your time seriously, so I only write about 5 Star medicine, and Blue Venom makes the cut into this elite group. The bud structure resembles White Widow in that the bus are tight and conical, with white crystals sparkling throughout their little bodies. I can feel the soaring White Widow effects, too, but with a refreshing Blueberry aftertaste that is both sweet and soothing. I've only taken three hits, and tha...”"
maddiesandas,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-venom/reviews/1234736,"“This strain is the best strain I've smoked yet honestly. When i first got my hands on it I was very satisfied with the way it looked, real leafy and crystaly with a wonderful piney scent to it. This strain has beautiful orange hairs with a light tent green and a darker green nugs. It smokes like a dream, smooth and tastes so lovely. The high is perfect. A mix between sativia and indica. Put me to sleep like a baby, b...”"
WickedStoner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-venom/reviews/1139814,"“This strain is good to smoke when you are feeling tired or down. It makes you feel alive and energetic.”"
BadgerBhoy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-venom/reviews/1179712,"“Obtained at Altai Mountain Organics in the NW Cannabis Market in Seattle. This strain has a great sweetish smell, with the typical Blueberry distinctiveness. White Widow comes through as relaxation gently settles. For a fast, relaxing smoke, this will take worries and pain away, without knocking you out.”"

I sometimes just sniff the jar just to smell that scent again. the high is relaxing and easily lulls you to sleep. this is more of a daytime flower, howev...”"
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-venom/reviews/1257686,"“I rarely indulge in indica dominant strains, but this strain is making me consider trying others.  Feels like a vacation.   Relaxing, dreamy, smile inducing.  So nice.”"

dl95,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-venom/reviews/1146620,"“Very likely the greatest high I've ever had.
It doesn't kick in until about two minutes after inhale (through a bong with an ash catch and a perc), but my friends and I all agree that it's some of the best weed we've ever had.
For me, the thing that distinguishes Blue Venom from all other weed is that after you smoke it you feel as if the place you are at that moment is exactly where you're supposed to be, and there'...”"
Robinofkent,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-venom/reviews/1256841,"“Good Meds. Rolls in slow, but hangs around for a while with right amount relaxation to kill the pain. But not to the point of couch lock. Higher doses can produce a mildly trancy effect, so beware of dosage. All around, great for use day or evening for normal activities around the house or sharing with other patients. Oh! A word before you dose.......have plenty of drinks ready, this is thirsty stuff.”"
mckaig73,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-venom/reviews/1146615,"“This is by far one of my favorite strains.  Very relaxing, stress-relieving strain.  I normally use a vaporizer and this strain is about as smooth as it gets.  Takes a few minutes to kick in, then it's off to Chillville.”"

LooneyMagician,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-venom/reviews/1319634,"“Definetly worth a try!
The smell is very lovely, fruity or berry like.
 I smoked it out of my semi clean/semi dirty water bong and it was very fruity (best way to describe it lol)
You're going to want a glass of your favorite juice with you for this one hahahah.
That being said this strain is definetly strong and will leave you relaxed after a long day of work.”"

benalexander,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-venom/reviews/1172602,"“Looked nice. But not very strong. I didnt really get much of the indica high from the blueberry but abit of relaxation from the whitewidow. For a good price...$5 or $6 a gram would be fair. But not the best. A good daytime smoke for a quick relaxation though on a budget.”"
