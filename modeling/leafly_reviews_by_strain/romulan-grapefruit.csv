I really wanted to play music (Alabama Shakes) and not sing along, but really get into the music.  It's definitely a good simple level straight high ... doesn't have highs/lows, it's so much a static high.

The bud is very tasty in a joint...the taste has a "sativa flavor" initial taste, and finishes with a more arthy-woodsy "indica flavor" (the flavor hints at the high actually).

By looks alone, this flower is already a 5 star rating. But what about the effects.... Super creeper strain. Slightly skunky aroma with a hint of citrus lingering on the palate.
