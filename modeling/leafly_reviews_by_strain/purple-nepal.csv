An excellent indica, delivering a pious attitude and rightfully so. Opening a jar will deliver a fruit loops cereal scent lighting your eyes with her glistening frost complementing the healthy purple throughout.

Aside from Purple Nepal's well-known effects, I would say this strain will give you slightly hot ears and an inability to speak in your normal speaking voice. 4 Stars.”"

It's basically a pure indica that's substantial, relaxing, but not as heavy a some indicas. It's more like a cozy balance between mind and body. Deep, smooth and somewhat thoughtful. Excellent.”"
WhiteLioness,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-nepal/reviews/1337719,"“Smaller buds than I hoped I would get, but the purple tinges of color and the crystals coating the outside were noticeable and emitted a sweet aroma. The flavor was sweet as well with a grape or berry flavor, earthy hints too. It was smooth from the inhale to exhale.

But after seeing a great donation at $40 a 1/4 oz., I quickly rushed the chance to get a little tasty! Was not disappointed at all! My cut was very purple, with a green dash of wonderful. Sweet and earthy grape and better than I imagined. Happy and relaxed, music's great on a Friday night.  My girlfriend won't stop bugging me for another hit, LOL! So, overal...”"
CHSCO843970,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-nepal/reviews/1460525,"“For the balance of CBC and THC both being high this strain is perfect for someone suffering from anxiety. 

The strain in my experience usually allows the patient or rec user to be able to focus more on the beautiful and happier thanks rather than the worrisome aspects of life that usually consumes their mental outlook. 

As well as it's amazing anxiety benefits her flowers are beautiful and smell amazing! Helps the ...”"

Grunt0311,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-nepal/reviews/1335811,"“This is a great strain, as mentioned here, for relaxing after a long day of work or a relaxing weekend.  For my applications, I will typically medicate with Purple Nepal first, get the mind and body relaxed, then have something like Querkle or GDP to ensure I will actually have a restful sleep.  Perhaps if someone is still a modest smoker this may actually give you a 2-3 afterrnoon nap, but more seasoned patients may...”"
