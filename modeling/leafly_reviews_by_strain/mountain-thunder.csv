winslowAZ,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mountain-thunder/reviews/1729066,"“Very energetic. I switch to another strain after noon or I can't sleep. Seems to work synergistically with caffeine. Some rapid heart beat/palpitations with this strain, confirmed when the budtender mentioned, in-prompted, that her friend gets the same effects.”"
