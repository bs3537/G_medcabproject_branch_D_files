=============
lvdylucifer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1410313,"“I really liked the way this strain smelled. really fruity and sweet. I smoked two bongs between me and my housemate and we just watched the sunset from our porch. Super happy high. Definitely made the stresses of the day slip away. Smashed a honey bun like nobodies business and now I can't feel my leg.”"
nancypants,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1354198,"“Tried this for the first time last night. Definitely a light high, not too overpowering. Played W.O.W. for a solid 4 hours and then went happily to sleep (after eating Lucky Charms, pizza and drinking about 2qts of water!) Good for mellowing out but won't induce couch lock...could probably have accomplished some more things if it weren't already 11pm when I started to smoke!”"
Tobleaf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1351870,"“Holy, that Hybrid kicks in just as a super silver haze kind of high, I am boosted every hit for 30 minutes, just perfect for work, after a nice buzzing stoned rides u through 2-5 hours, tho full energy, if you keep you just a little bit busy. 

Also at home for creativity perfect! 

So far my new fave strain for playing music:D
Love

P.S. A bong and a couch can also lead to a full 5 hour couchsesh”"
mmmoon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1334490,"“This bud gets a five star review just for how great it smells. Your nose won't ever bleed again ;)
Amazing high that seems to be perfectly between sativa and indica. 
Imagine that dank strain that got stepped on by a T rex and went extinct. Idk tho.”"
magichabits,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1351868,"“Beautiful buds with an exotic smell - a sharp sour pungency just like lavender. The high is somewhat mild and not remarkably long lasting. But the experience of handling the bud and smoking it is amazing with Ambrosia.”"
Jasonue,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1275202,"“Gave me an aroused, compete thought and relaxed mood all at the same time”"
bk709,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1351872,"“ambrosia was advertised as an indica when I purchased it. it was recommended to me by a dispensary clerk who said it was great for anyone who liked cheese. 

This strain is very balanced and mild. I got no paranoia or couchlock with this strain, even with a few big bong-hits. Ambrosia is a great anytime strain as it doesn't give you a whole lot of energy and it doesn't really mellow you out too much either. it will g...”"
Delysid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1201563,"“A wonderful hybrid with accent on the sativa side if things. Very pleasant, clearheaded, fun stone. Not as many profound insights & cosmic thinking as a good sativa, but also very little anxiety or paranoia.”"
carwallaby,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1266084,"“Wow. This is my favorite strain. Great body high, very calming, doesn't give me the munchies, and lets me drift smoothly to sleep. Like melting into my bed.”"
RevyRogue,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1303172,"“Pineapple Ambrosia by Temple of Calyx via First Class Medicinal. Lovin this stuff!

-nice smell, kinda tropical fruit smell like mango not so much pineapple, earthy
-taste is almost a fruity buttery taste, really nice
-vaped at 195C
-very mellow high, felt like doing things, felt energetic and active. Body felt pretty relaxed”"
HazeyJane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1351871,"“Liked this one a lot, found it quite woodsy and sticky. Smoked a couple times with great results, a pretty intense high, lasts a long time. Made me very energetic and happy, couldn't wipe the smile off my face, then slowly trails off into a lovely hazy state. However, I would be careful if you are prone to anxiety freak-outs, I smoked a LOT of this one night and had a bad time. That is my fault though, this is a wond...”"
flyboy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1351869,"“After signing up for an account, I came to review Ambrosia because it is my favorite strain over the past 50-100 I've tried.  I'd say it's my #1. I don't have any now, nor for a few months, so I don't remember the exact qualities, but an overall beautiful taste and excellent sativa high with comfortable body buzz comes to mind. Also, it kept me going at night without every making me tired, every joint another 30 mins...”"

jaimep,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1235839,"“Delicious fresh scent to this aptly-named strain, and even better flavor after the exhale. Effects were euphoric, giggly, and creative. Wonderful for daytime use.”"

pkpdogg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1375424,"“Hits quick but is nicely manageable.  Non-sleepy effect without the paranoia.  Is my "go to" outside of the straight indicas that I prefer.

CLARIFICATION - My review is for the Ambrosia offered by JAHnetics in the SF Bay Area.  It is a cross between Super Lemon Haze and Blueberry Yum Yums. Only realized this difference after more strain details were posted here.”"
VlRAL,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1747268,"“Ambrosia gives me a very mild high compared to all other strains I've tried.
I have Bipolar,OCD as well as depression and anxiety
This strain works AMAZINGLY when it comes to uplifting mood,calming and clearing the mind and overall make your day brighter.

It is my go to now whenever I'm feeling down or have the beginning of a headache. Falling asleep is much easier with ambrosia as well

Luchador,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1275465,"“Mine was a clean smoke with an almost immediate cerebral high. I find this strain to be clear headed. I was able to accomplish daily routine tasks, while feeling great. However, I didn't think that this strain had a particularly unique feeling to it. I give it a 7 out of 10.”"
blueshifter,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1588976,"“A great strain to vape if you want to have a staring contest with your cat. Seriously; you think you know your cat pretty well, but if you really lock eyes with the creature and allow the mind-meld to sluice on through, you realize you don't know shit about what's going on in that furry little feline head, and you fully grok that all this time you've been sharing your house with a little four footed alien. 

Oh and t...”"
StellarStoner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1239105,"“This strain smells pleasant it tastes sweet and one hit provides a kick ass high. I bought this at the Moss Crossing Dispensary in Eugene OR and its a weed, I mean FLOWER, I want more of. Its really good stuff!”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1512202,"“The head sensations are strong and long lasting. Your mind takes a flight to incredible places. Yet at the same time there's a comforting body buzz too. I really like this one and I think you will  also. Despite the head effects your attention is laser sharp. Quite a unique combination for sure.”"
superlemondays,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1252024,"“the most nutritious strain I ever tasted.  was a 50/50 sativa indica hybrid at the time.”"

onelittlecarrot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1251684,"“Tried this today to help with a migraine.  It worked almost instantly AND I could still work (PhD student).  I was focused, relaxed, and my anxiety was much lower.  The migraine tension, sensitivities, and nausea evaporated.  This will be my new go-to for pain relief when I still need to function.”"
RudiCanada,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1259013,"“TIGHT buds covered in red fur.  Sweet, creamy smell and tastes like tropical fruit.  Strong relaxing effects from Burmese and God bud combo.
Rudi's final thought:  Smoke/Vape a fat bowl of this right before... you do anything!  Great for mood altering.”"

seizedtheday,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1170001,"“Very nice strain! Puts me in a good mood and energized. Head and body high, not too bad of munchies. Very relaxing on the muscles.
 It is also one of the rare strains I can smoke by myself and still feel the energy and boost. A lot of times when I'm high on my own, I just get tired.”"

The high was felt through my entire body and made me happy, uplifted, and relaxed.  I am not normally a hybrid fan, but this strain is just potent enough to take the edge off and cause relaxation, perfect for a productive day.

Stoner_Tim,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1156742,"“Definitely one of my favourite strains. Citrus smell, and faint citrus, strong earthy, piny taste.
The First few puffs are quite rough, but the end of the roach tastes delicious. Almost instant high, moderate appetite. High lasts for about 45 minutes, then a peace of mind for 15-20, finishing off without a low. About 1-1.5 hours after smoking, you're back to sober like a Sasquatch. Great for public, almost no anxiety...”"

halfday,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1412705,"“3.7/5

Definitely a solid hybrid option. This is a strain which helps you harness your energy and creativity while still remaining functional. Ambrosia may very well give you an appetite, but even then, it's controllable. Would recommend Ambrosia for any outdoor activity, or just lounging about on a pretty day.”"
Sundancecassb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ambrosia/reviews/1291712,"“I found it wore off really quickly. My dispensary sold it to me as a pure sativa. I felt calm and creative. Overall I liked it but found it melow and short lived.”"
