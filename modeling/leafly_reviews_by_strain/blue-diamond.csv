thebethanator,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-diamond/reviews/1178662,"“I must admit, I hadn't smoked in about 2 years possibly more before I tried this amazing strain. I was visiting home (California) from my current state Kentucky. Two of my best friends had practically forced me to try this weed and I was hesitant because I have had precious battles with anxiety and panic attacks. I never relied on weed as a remedy because in the past it made my anxiety worse. After being persuaded to...”"

funkmasterphlex,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-diamond/reviews/1390556,"“Ide give it a 3.5. There was nothing bad about this one but there was also nothing too outstanding. What I did like was the way it worked for stress/anxiety. It took a minute but once it hit, I was just calm and content. Very nice body buzz that lasted long enough to get to know the strain but then would be gone. Sort of left me wanting more but enjoyable nonetheless. Not to much of a cerebral experience but kinda ho...”"
