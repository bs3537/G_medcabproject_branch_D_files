Hand_rolled,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1690928,"“So, I tried this strain on a whim. I was in a local pharmacy and Mimosa was recommended. The aroma sold me. Instantly. It’s almost airy, yet deep. Like a mimosa. I decided to go home and roll up. I smoked half of a leaf (sweet woods). My mood instantly changed. I dressed myself and conquered the day. (I’m a vet with severe depression and adjustment disorder. Life is rough sometimes.) the batch I tried was exquisite. ...”"

I've been talking my boyfriend's ear off for the last 45 minites and I'm feeling great! Unfortunately with it being almost 9pm I picked an awful time to smoke this... I feel like running a marathon!!
 This strain would be great during the day when you're awake and motivated to get stuff done! Even first thing in the morning to really get you started!
Hopefully I'll start winding d...”"

I waited to use it and used Sour Jack i flower form. I needed a morning sativa strain to help me move around with less pain. Once i was showered and more informed i was ready. I felt irritable from the sour jack-though it did give me a boost of energy. Once i vape a bit of the mimosa- i was i...”"
Rebecca2425,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1583302,"“So, needless to say, this is definitely not the strain to smoke the second you break your two week t-break. Veeeery heavy hitting. Made me really anxious for the first hour or so. I deal with a bit of social anxiety and I smoked and ended up going to Target at peak time and it was not fun. Once that heavy anxiety bout passed I was super focused and and aware of my surroundings. Sativa dominant strains always tweak me...”"

I’m snatching up a lifetime supply
You all run grab the rest
This bubbly is the by far best
Cheers 🌱🔥🥂”"
BlondeSavage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1763757,"“This is a good choice for anytime really. I’ve been looking for something to replace my favorite strain: orange cookie. This one does a pretty good job with uplifting my mood but makes me a bit more sleepy than orange cookie did. Minutes after I had it, I began to feel extremely focused. I feel like the effects are more calming than energizing. Overall, I would get it again.”"
Sharkleesha,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1650316,"“I really like this strain! The taste and smell is amazing, very sweet with a hint of citrus, but still has a nice kick to it. It makes me very focused and giggly. I had also talked an ear off on this strain, this was my all day smoke for a week up in Cali. By far my favorite because it doesn’t cause me any anxiety or paranoia!”"
daydreamerinwords,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1756714,"“Super uplifting, a nice slow smoke with a subtle head buzz at first but like the description and name of strain implies, something that can really “mess you up” in higher doses. Extremely tingly body buzz—I feel lightheaded and like my body is buzzing, so there is that painkilling element. The taste is unique, and it is soothing altogether. A nice, balanced, clearheaded hybrid.”"
Rakuma,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1752069,"“I consumed this strain through a distillate 500 mg cartridge. I would say this is a very uplifting and happy strain, within a few minutes of consuming I felt an immediate change in my mood, and became extra talkative and just let my thoughts flow through my mouth instead of my brain. I think this is a great strain for anyone who feels socially reclused or just trapped in your own mind.”"
dabbing_mermaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1685653,"“I really enjoy the smooth, transitioning high I get from this strain. It didn't hit me like a ton of bricks like some strains (which isn't bad, sometimes I like that), it was a very gradual, stoney feeling over a reasonable period of time. My mind feels very stimulated but minus all of the jittery caffeine feelings. Probably one of my new favorites.”"
CupcakeWarrior,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1759542,"“Definitely a good daytime smoke! Love this strain when its sunny out!! It makes you happy, energetic, and focused. I smoke this before hiking or fishing. Highly recommend this strain for a beautiful sunny day!!”"
princessy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1593524,"“Pretty potent strain that makes me very excitable and giggly! For me, it produces a very clear high that allows me to focus on day-to-day tasks, so it’s great to use when you want to remain active and social!”"
nspatient,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1754388,"“Amazing aroma. Gave me a very buzzy feeling in my head. The focus and energy effects are very strong. I prefer this in lower doses.

It gives me a migraine aura, but a headache does not develop. I get the same symptom from Purple Punch”"

Cookie_LifeKy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1692400,"“The mimosa flowers I received,where from one of the California cookies locations. It’s smells and tastes just like the name! Super fruity smell and great uplifting high! The terpenes are out of this world!! Literally smells like a mimosa! It has a citrus taste but not so strong that it’s sour or hurts your throat!  A perfect flower to enjoy outside! Cultivated by the jungle boys!”"
MST3KS0301,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1756285,"“I love the after taste I get when exhaling from my cartridge.  It makes me feel relaxed physically and focused mentally.  Two big hits and I can work!”"
Chernobyx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1752557,"“The smell is top notch, reminiscent of a fizzy orange soda. Sweet and smooth on the exhale. It's a creeping high but a functional one, leaving you relaxed but energized enough to face the day.”"

Was really lucky to get perfectly groomed, dense crystal action, lime green , light yellow and white buds.   Mad flavor, citrus rind and kind and matures in a glass jar nicely.

The look: Bud is like a spring  coilled towards the top, fluffy fresh and looks vibrant lime mint green, well groomed the leafs curl inward like their shy awe ;3, foxtail with trichs toward the top look like a popcorn bulb just perfect.

Sugarbush811,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mimosa/reviews/1693493,"“This strain made me get a lot of stuff done but did not make me social at all. I went to a fair after smoking this and totally had a panic attack. I think this strain focuses in on any feelings you have-negative or positive- and heightens them. Not relaxing at all but good at a small dose in certain situations that involve solo getting shit done.”"

It’s nice when strains taste like what the strain it claims to be, and mimosa couldn’t taste any better than what it’s described, and the high is unreal. It’s covered in terpenes, you can see the purple from the purple punch of its lineage, and it couldn’t taste anymore like the actual clementine of it’s parentage too.
