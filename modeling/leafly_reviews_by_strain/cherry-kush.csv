Cherry Kush
=============
DJHardNoX,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1412824,"“In my top 3 of all time! That cherry flavor is weet and familiar and one of a kind all at once. Red hairs, dense, frosted, but that smell! So sweet. Tasted even better just amplified from the smell. Caped in the volcano. Little goes a long way. Felt relaxed, not lazy. Felt happy, good, general sense of well being. Troubles melted away. I felt very sexual and making love was amazing. Touch was so sensitive. No let dow...”"
BernieSanders,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1416041,"“This is a strong flower. And that is coming from an every evening smoker. Not many buds could knock me down with just one bowl, but boy howdy did this girl do her trick. And even fewer bud could do so, and have the ability to relate that it was a pleasant experience for me? Even fewer. She is aptly strong, but doesn't want to hurt you- just play with you.”"
alittleweird7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1395478,"“Comes on fast. Feels good entire time. Tastes and smells absolutely delicious! Gets rid of headaches, nausea, and a lot of stress. Total relaxer. Uplifts your mood a lot, from also not stressing anymore. Easier to laugh. Calm, chill, functioning high.”"

thefrancomiester,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1354092,"“Literally the best high I've ever experienced. Definitely not a couch lock, very active strain that gave us 6 ridiculous laughing fits. Crazy munchies, a lot of weird but funny speculations and philosophies were said. Great strain to listen to music to.”"
cannakushmis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1347987,"“A real gem right here, cherry Kush is a beautiful member of the kush family. The batch I got was A+. Dense, aromatic, and a quick relief from the body high. Taste much like master kush but hints of the purple afghani come through.”"

StaySpacey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1363466,"“Was recommended this strain from the budtender for my anxiety, picked up a quarter. Smoked a bowl right after lunch when I happened to feel an anxiety attack coming on. Taste was a bit like burnt Cherry Pop Tarts. Instantly gave me a racy feeling, I felt like I drank too much coffee and the head high was a little too introspective for work. I kept thinking out loud. Overall was a decent high, very warm and uplifting ...”"
CH33SE,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1354093,"“I'll give Cherry Kush 5 stars simply because it tastes great, and I know if I need a good night sleep this girl will put me out like a light. The Cherry Kush I obtained has a deep, dark, indica effect. Not something I would do in the day, unless it was nap time. Very cherry flavor mix with a classic Kush flavor. Try it using glass to get the full flavor.”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1239816,"“Vision immediately brightens and widens. Combined with a slow, but honed focus, you assess things as individual scenes - settling into a single perspective with no periphery. I smoked a lot at once and the effects came on quickly and enjoyably, with the exception of an uncomfortable twinge in the chest saying I did too much at once. I’m sure it’ll settle, especially as the body high kicks up, but mind the warning. Mu...”"
Justin1116,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1183421,"“One of my favorites. Cherry Kush has a very berry flavor to it as its name would suggest. Its smell is sweet and strong. Beautiful red hairs.”"
Fernand,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1256507,"“I'm One to believe "there can be only One". And a good concentrate just needs one chance to step up to "the plate".

tylerhwood92,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1282967,"“Brainy high. We thought about how a base 12 system makes a lot more sense. In terms of the taste, it tastes like cherry coke, but probably because we've been drinking cherry coke, as well as a little nutty and earthy. But I took a dab before I came here so what do I know. As for the the sensation, "I feel real weird right now." Was a good description. Would smoke again. "We should start a band!"”"
Jak33,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1493639,"“My favorite strain. I can never find it. Found some today and its so fire. I'm from Oregon and the tree here I feel is some of the best on earth. Cherry kush and cherry pie are two different strains though. Cherry pie is grand daddy purple and Durban poison.

josiahq,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1390884,"“The quintessential indica: strong, fruity nose; red hairs and dense trichomes; and a rich smoke that doesn't cause a cough. Effects began within 1-2 minutes with an immediate "chill" feeling with a veneer of euphoria. Senses of touch and taste were significantly elevated.

Great for watching a movie, sleeping, or sex. Pairs well with crisp and more mineral whites like a verdicchio or a chenin blanc from California.”"

The smell will fill the room, so make sure it is sealed properly. I have never smoked any strain with such an intense sweet, cool, and somewhat minty taste. Smoked from a joint it hits hard and may make you cough, but if you smoke it out of a bowl you should be fine. The high feels like an intense ru...”"
Debaser,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1369354,"“I picked some up as a special. There was absolutely no smell to the buds - zero. I was worried that the vendor ripped me off, but the smoke - though it didn't have a ridiculous peak - was mellow and long-lasting.”"
RyByrdland,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1418424,"“I originally purchased this as "All Star" which isn't an actual strain, but a brand of Cherry Kush. And come to find out there are people who call this strain "Cherry Pie" out in California, but in Phoenix Cherry Pie is the strain listed on Leafly (Durban x GDP). So name problems abound.... 

Still it bears some resemblance to Cherry Pie—big, fluffy yet sticky, and about as purple. This particular bud has a dense tri...”"
Toker180,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1390883,"“This was one of the first Cherry strains that I had and it was amazing! It's a very euphoric and uplifting high that will not leave you stuck to the couch! It makes everything you do 100 times better and if you're with friends, you'll laugh more than ever. The after effects just slowly settle you down back to your normal self which is a good thing meaning you wont have to smoke more just to wake yourself up from a hi...”"

My new favorite.”"

Oregon-Vet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1591510,"“I am ADHD and strains tend to not react as expected.  Cherry Kush has become my go-to for both pain relief and for combating the insomnia with which I am plagued.  For me, it is particularly enhanced when using high CBD strains such as Harlequin, Cannatonic, or Harle-Tsu along with the Cherry Kush.  The high is quite mellow and pleasant.  Full body relaxing but no couch-lock.”"

LorDoza,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-kush/reviews/1346168,"“I would say this is a 4/5. Just like other Kush varieties, Cherry Kush is extremely smooth in both inhale and exhale. Sweet with a tinge of citrus and berry. Effects are certainly felt from the Kush side of things, but I can also feel the upliftedness coming from the sativa that's also rooted in this strain. Great mixture of highs, and overall an awesome hybrid”"
