The nice folks at the local shop here in Seattle recommended this. Nailed it! Felt focused, relaxed but never zombie mode. Fine with social interactions. Added this to my 'hot list'. Based on my experience, I'd have this be my 'wing man' at the next outdoor barbecue/social get together I'd prefer to miss, but have been shamed into attending.”"
jscovs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-super-silver-haze/reviews/1358447,"“The buds look so good I could eat them. They are a very crystalized mix of green and orange with a scent that is the closest to real pineapple weed can get. the high comes on quick providing a great head rush and a little burst of energy bringing with it a cascading wave if happiness and creativity that makes it impossible to be unhappy.”"
ShinGimmel,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-super-silver-haze/reviews/1390735,"“One of the best tasting sativas I've had. Fairly powerful but definitely still nice and clear. Highly recommend trying if available. Mine was from Topshelf.”"
truhawaii,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-super-silver-haze/reviews/1354833,"“Tried this strain today and I loved it!   I was surprised how clear my mind was for how relaxed my body felt.     I had zero issues with my memory getting out of whack.    I hate the early Alzheimer's kinda effects some other Sativa Hybrid strains make me have with lots of "what was I just thinking and supposed to do?" moments.    I like clear headed, daytime use strains so I can get through my sometimes arduous work...”"

Jewced,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-super-silver-haze/reviews/1365519,"“I swear I could drink this... it smells like straight pineapple juice. definitely a favorite of mine. 10/5”"
Steviewonderbug,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-super-silver-haze/reviews/1510200,"“Pros: Every time I smell this strain, I want to eat the damn bud. It smells sooooo gooooood. The high also kicks in very quick. The flavor is very good.

Cons: It isn't a thing that happens every time I smoke this, but there are times where I just get way to spaced out and become anti social and I don't want to do anything.”"
10khits,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-super-silver-haze/reviews/1554334,"“I'm new to the vape scene so I asked my local budtender what strain he thought would be great for getting some creative writing done. He suggested Top Shelf's Pineapple Super Silver Haze based on his personal experience, and I'm SO glad he did.

This strain gave me a strong head high that wasn't too overwhelming, and I was able to sit down and get a bit of writing done. Goal = accomplished. 

Not only does this strai...”"

Get your straight jackets on tonight!

I just channeled Kevin DuBrow. If you knew me, you'd know how amazing this strain is solely from that statement.

Go get it. You'll be smiling, giggling, laughing, and may even channel a 80s metal icon, like I did! 👍”"

Purple_State_of_Mind,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-super-silver-haze/reviews/1272031,"“I don't usually get sativas simply because I do all my smoking in the evening to help with my insomnia. However, last weekend a few friends and I were going on a sort of camping trip so I wanted a strain I could smoke in the day and still feel social. Pineapple Super SIlver Haze was a beautiful, compact and sweet haze with a tropical undertone. My particular phenotype had a more diesel taste than a tropical one but t...”"

KassiePerez,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-super-silver-haze/reviews/1548180,"“Definitely a new favorite. I like smoking this at night once the kid is in bed, I can stay up and watch so many Netflix shows. This one keeps you up all night. Usually when I’m coming down from smoking sativas I get tired... nope not this one. 

This tastes pretty good and the smell... omg so good. If your store has this, don’t pass it up, give it a try. It’s really really good.”"
WashingtonGreenery23,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-super-silver-haze/reviews/1280346,"“I'm not the biggest sativa guy. Usually if I smoke too much l will not enjoy the high as much with my anxiety... However this strain is a hit! So Stoney. Feels like 10000 little massagers on my brain! Cerebral and uplifting. This sweet sativa will life your mood and make you want to do something with yourself! Awesome!”"

TonyStark206,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-super-silver-haze/reviews/1367169,"“Great uplifting Sativa, very energetic and talkative for me. Made sushi happy hour great but not too munchy, which can happen with some sativas and hybrids for me. Made my girlfriend a little anxious out in public but, amazing uplifting effects and enjoyable for me. Definitely great smelling and tasting. We enjoyed a preroll from Nebula Gardens purchased at Fweedom - Mountlake Terrace.”"

It has all the qualities I look for in a sativa-a nice wave of euphoria and happiness, with slight boost in energy and focus, but also calming and relaxing. The buds are absolutely beautiful and the scent and taste of pineapple is so strong it's crazy delicious! From Top Shelf at Green Collar Cannabis 20.2% THC and a whopping 1.06% CBD! I'm glad I picked up an eighth-this will definitely be my go-to day...”"
