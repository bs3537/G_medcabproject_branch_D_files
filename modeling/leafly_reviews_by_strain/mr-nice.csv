I'm not a connoisseur, but I have tried a number of indicas (~12).  This one is -- by far -- my favorite.  I suffer from destructive anxiety attacks, and also have chronic joint and muscle pain.  I am disabled, mostly walking with forearm crutches for short distances.  Mr. Nice addresses the anxiety, and the pain, beautifully.  I often use my time with this indi...”"
