deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/whitewalker-og/reviews/1397626,"“🤖🍻 White Walker O.G. from Cannabiotix is a sinister treat to the O.G. world. She is potent, beautiful, super sticky, and downright dank. It's hard to go wrong with an O.G. if it was grown and cured properly. This is such a great strain for putting your mind at ease. She smells of a fresh cut lawn mixed with the most sour pine cone you've ever smelt. That classic O.G. scent resonates strong with this one. Such a nic...”"

You get so relaxed and can still do get around to being active. Remember smoking this once and having sex and OMG best sex of my life hands down. Moral of the story, don't miss out on this if you have the chance to smoke it. 11/10 would recommend. Name says it all.”"

I think it's helping for sure, and it's definitely helping with depression and pain as well. However, it's only 2:25pm and I feel completely couch locked.

What else do you need besides complete pain relief and all your stress and worries evaporated? No munchies, headaches, paranoia, or anxiety. The true "God's gift".
