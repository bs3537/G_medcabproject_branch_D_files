cliffleon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/happy-rancher/reviews/1229641,"“Amazing strain. Within minutes of smoking you feel the euphoric buzz creep over you. After about an hour it's a talkative, relaxing, yet still active vibe. Very great for anxiety and socializing.”"
SevenPointShutter,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/happy-rancher/reviews/1344461,"“Along with its exceptional aromas and flavours, Jolly Rancher has an almost elegant cerebral high with no cloudiness. This is an enjoyable daytime strain as it mitigates symptoms of Crohn's Disease while allowing for productivity.”"

sweetbutter80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/happy-rancher/reviews/1385210,"“I don't remember my pain scale as this was last night. Nausea has been a 9 pretty consistantly lately. Medicated round 2200 or so? takes botu 10 min to start kickin in. Pain was gone but some nausea still there which blows. Did not put me to sleep either but my hubby's happy bout that! ;-) I did fall asleep round 0300 but I'm pretty sure the meds had worn off before then. I'd recommend for newbies for pain/nausea. Bu...”"

MurderMyLove,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/happy-rancher/reviews/1242869,"“I love this strain.. It doesn't take much really. Just a couple puffs and I am feeling better already. I'm not too paranoid. I feel relaxed. This is definitely a good strain to smoke if you have issues with anxiety. Highly recommended for anyone though.”"
wadewestwhy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/happy-rancher/reviews/1359835,"“remember that leafy bud you used to buy off that random dude you once knew? yeah, this is that bud. it's definitely resembles bush weed with a mild density to the nugs. it tastes and smells like backyard weed. it has a nice high, but it's subtle (not strong). this is a strain where you end up smoking a lot. i don't hate this strain, but i def don't like it either. i wouldn't buy again but i WOULD recommend to anyone ...”"
GrassGirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/happy-rancher/reviews/1318234,"“Such a clean, up, giggly high! It tasted sweet and delicious in my vape and hit me quickly.  The flavours were lovely at first, but they don't last -- it got bland after a few medium hits of the vape. The up part of the high lasted about 1.5 hours and then I got relaxed and sleepy and mellow. I really like this strain.”"

Mr.BC.Cheese720,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/happy-rancher/reviews/1361395,"“One of the first strain's I tried when I started out back in 2014 was the high CBD strain called Jolly Rancher. All though i did not know it at the time (Or what CBD was) but a friend did recognize the smell of the bud the second time i got it two and a half years later. It has a slightly og gassy under tunes to it but vary sweat, like a sour candy. Medicinally it is awesome so if you ever get chance pick it up.”"
