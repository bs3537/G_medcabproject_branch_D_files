Haze
=============
Franksimilia,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/haze/reviews/1415000,"“I ve been smoking this strain regularly for about three years now. Sometimes nothing can compare to that classic old school haze. The cerebral high is a hard-hitter, makes me extremely focused, talkative and happy, it erases every iota of stress within me and gives me monster munchies. But it also causes a bit of paranoia for a few mins, which is easy to handle for me. One of my all time favs. But if u have a tendenc...”"

The citrusy aroma can't be beat, and this bud is the stickiest bud I've ever encountered. I like sativas but I usually like there to be some relaxing factor.
