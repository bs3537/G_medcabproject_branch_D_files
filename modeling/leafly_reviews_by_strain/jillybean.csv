Uplifting, energetic, and happy emotions. 

As it begins to peak the sativa side starts fading out into a very strong indica side. All you want to-do is sleep or lay down. It crashes you down swiftly but gentle to an extent. 

It's hard to really explain. It's not like O.G. Kush how it crashs you down. But it's dec...”"

Using the same amount as I would with any other strain in an MFLB, I came close to the too-much-energy-for-comfort touchpoint, which meant I had enough adrenaline for a panic attack, but since Jillybean left me so clear-thinking, I was able to counter the problem with simple breathing techniques. At the right amount (slightly less than usual for me), I found Jillybea...”"

I've grown it from seed, and have also purchased it many times from dispensaries, all with virtually the same effect. Bright neon green with lots of orange pistils, and totally caked with sugary trichomes. Definately sativa dominant, but not speedy and racy. Very uplifting and positive high.

The buzz is mild even though it has a decent THC content because it also has a generous level of CBD. It only affects me for about an hour and 15 minutes which makes it nice if I have to drive later.

JacobbTG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jillybean/reviews/1242320,"“This is a highly enjoyable strain for gaming or watching tv or movies. It has a very pleasant and strong creep effect, the duration of which I found to be in excess of 90 minutes. Pleasant taste, quite a strong bite but that's to be expected with such a potent strain. Highly recommended for gamers and people going on a Netflix binge.”"

Superb almost candy-like sweetness, citrus and tropical fruit comes up from the first smell of flower. The taste is a complex mix of citrus/mango/orange candy flavor, followed by a pleasant slight peppery after taste. 

Great feelings of motivation stem from just a few hits, a few more hits and you are relaxe...”"
aincardone,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jillybean/reviews/1303540,"“Meh. Not a great sativa hybrid for an indica lover like me. Woman at shop referred it for headaches even after I showed the hesitancy to sativa leaning strains, so I figured I'd give it a shot.

She was right about one thing; this strain sure does correlate with headaches. It causes them! Boo to this "ich"!”"

nuyorico15,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jillybean/reviews/1333841,"“Probably the most well balanced, Sativa leaning strain I have ever had .. Just enough pep without being racy or panic inducing .. Good for getting writing work done and keeping depression at bay .. I deal with both severe anxiety/ptsd as well as depression so getting the right strain for ME has always been iffy - Would definitely recommend!”"

Tasted great, had a smell kind of like tangerines and a musky smell mixed together. Totally a creeper strain though, didn't feel it for about 10 minutes. Once it kicked in things were great for about two hours.

A good skiiing strain. :p”"
