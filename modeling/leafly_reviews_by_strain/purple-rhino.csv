My husband made this into a tea for me to help combat insomnia. Not only was it the best sleep I've had in years, but it relieved my muscle soreness/stiffness as well. I felt pretty good when I woke up the next morning, which is really saying something when you have Parkinson's Disease. Truly amazing!”"

Jeremy0000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-rhino/reviews/1353529,"“For me this strain helped my insomnia the most. PR is straight knock-out gas if you would like to go to sleep. it relaxes the muscles and eases mental tension as well. Give you the "I feel heavy, but I'm gliding around" feeling that is known with indicas.”"

jaypreme,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-rhino/reviews/1693061,"“I did not quite feel any relieving effects from this strain, definitely given the impression it would be strong by the smell, the appearance and rating at the dispensary. It was like any average - sub par strain. I only became a little buzzed and it wasn’t for very long.”"

ARTailor8,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-rhino/reviews/1362116,"“Upon arriving at the procurer’s establishment, I realized I smelled a lavender scent with a slight pungency and skunkiness about 10 feet away from the closed front door. This was definitely some, ‘loud’ flower but in a sweeter, more floral sense than the typical Skunk and O.G. profiles that are more common. When smelling these flower buds closer, the pungency of the White Rhino can definitely be detected along with l...”"

RainbowJedi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-rhino/reviews/1546885,"“I'm having surgery tomorrow to remove a large ovarian cyst. This strain has been invaluable to my effort to manage my pain. The cyst causes me to have severe nausea/vomiting and lose my appetite, so this strain helps me keep food down, and helps me actually want to eat it. It almost works better than the prescription painkillers I was given.”"
overflowcbd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-rhino/reviews/1607304,"“Fresh, earthy taste. Has a smooth transition as it eases you into an uplifting eurphria that lasts for 3 hours. Very calming and relaxed, (slightly) sedative come down. This predominantly-indica hybrid is perfect after a long day or before bedtime.”"

Cowboybebop17,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-rhino/reviews/1371809,"“5.0 top of the top if not the best. The description by leafly is spot on. "White Rhino" was my favorite at my first dispensary (like they said high thc% for patients ailments) mixed w purps another of my favorites literally (I love the color ect). Mix in a little sativa in the bowel and your good white rhino makes the hi last long time while the purps intensify it.”"
