Smelled earthy and sweet and tasted great in the vaporizer. It was quite the creeper and but very relaxing from beginning to end.  Will definitely be using this one as an evening time sacrament. So thankful to Jah for this blessing.”"

And the relaxed body with super mellow headspace cannot be beat. Do you give too many fucks about stuff? Then you need BuKu to clear them out.”"
MeditationMedication,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/burmese-kush/reviews/1065330,"“I would not smoke this before bed - very tingly body high but I felt restless. I could smoke a lot with no intense head buzz. It made me very calm and collected. I smoked for pain in my ankle but it seemed to make me concentrate on my pain more and I couldn't sleep.

If you smoke during the day you will feel very relaxed and focussed. In the evening when you're tired it will just make you lazy and hungry. Very good all-rounder.”"
