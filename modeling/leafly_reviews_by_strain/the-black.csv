HurricaneDrew3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/the-black/reviews/1417648,"“It might be true what they say, "once you go black, you never go back" I had low expectations for this strain so I am surprised it is one of my new favorites. It's everything I look for in a strain. Pretty appearance, slightly fruity taste. Although they say it's an indica I never felt like sleeping or sitting around. I was extremely talkative, deep in thoughts, and motivated. I also developed a case of what I call i...”"

Medicinally:
Pain 
Insomnia
Stress

All relieved by this guy. This bud is a special treat, you just don't know it's one of favorite strains yet.”"
MrSlayer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/the-black/reviews/1417649,"“The Black is an incredible indica not for the light-of-heart that dates back to the late 1980's in California and on Vancouver Island. This medication is guaranteed to sooth and produce, with crystal coated fan leaves that turn from dark purple to black during flowering. With an instantaneous high and a soothing narcotic nature, The Black makes for a very beneficial nighttime herb.

Followed by a silly transaction at the grocery store where I tried a card 3 times, before realizing I had the cash. Only to leave the store and drive 22 blocks towards home with my headlights off! That after 3 hits off my glass pipe after buying it from The Sativia Sisters in Spokane Valley.”"
Extraterrestrial,https://www.leafly.com/indica/the-black/reviews/1417650,"“A truly superior late-night and/or pain/insomnia relief strain. Spicy, hashy taste. Starts out fairly flat, with a "basic indica" body high & slight mental energy, but quickly (within 15-20 minutes) moves to a detached body feeling, drifty/cloudy thoughts, and sleepytime. Outstanding for this purpose-- but if you're not seeking a high couch-lock factor, stay away!”"

This strain is one of the greatest breakthroughs for body and muscle pain I have discovered in a long time. Definitely for night time use. My anxiety And depressive mood are neutralized. As a chronic pain sufferer I highly recommend you try this one. Another unusually powerful and hard hitting strain. This has earned its place in a top 3 for myself. Thanks t...”"

I was able to pick up a zip, and when I began to check it out visually, It looked like deep,dark brown, equatorial cannabis - Jamaican, Thai, Panama, Columbian. When I got in for a closer look, I saw that the browns were golden up against deep velvet/indigo purple grey buds like I've never seen before.”"

Musky, herbal, sweet woody. Didn't really meet my expectation in the taste department, but it was good, just unique. 

High
Calming and soothing. Great for stress, not the best for sleep though. Mind, emotion and body numbness occurs as dosage increased. 

Structure
Dense little buds of happiness with needle like pistils.”"
