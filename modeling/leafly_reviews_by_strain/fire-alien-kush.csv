Fire Alien Kush
=============
deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fire-alien-kush/reviews/1393717,"“🔥👽 Fire Alien Kush is a perfect hybrid. Alien in it's perfection with an even 50/50 Sativa / Indica balance. It is so uplifting, it has become a personal essential. It can bring hope into the worst day of your life and will bring you a smile for the present moment. It is so relaxing and calming. The flavor is quite nice; overly earthy with an exotic wood scent that I can't quite pinpoint. Aromatic AF. This is a bea...”"

Initial hit brought on a bit of mild euphoria followed by very nice buzz. Very creative feel and not too cloudy.  Be careful tho heavy use can clear your schedule... Def one of My "go to" strains.”"

snorb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fire-alien-kush/reviews/1393720,"“Definitely fire
Definitely alien
Definitely kush

Picked this strain up at Rose City Oreganics and the bag appeal is very nice; dark and light greens in the foliage with a frosted appearance from the trichomes. 
The smell earthy, slightly piney. The high is superb; clear, able to focus, complete tasks, but if you sit down, expect to be there. I use it to treat migraines and PTSD. One of my top five favs.”"
ValleyofGreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fire-alien-kush/reviews/1327734,"“Tested at 21.52 THCA. 104% D9THC.    .00% CBD  .005% CBN
And 23.3% Cannabinoid content.

On first appearance it's light green with orange to dark red hairs and  was covered in alot of small trichs. the smell was very light . Much like the description it  leaned more to the alien kush and gives a heavy cerebral feeling at first and goes to a  relaxing  indica effect after a short while. would certainly try again.”"

Very recommended!”"

lukebag,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fire-alien-kush/reviews/1327736,"“I've had versions of this grown in the Las Vegas Area. It seems like it takes more from the alien in the smell and high. It's decently frosty, good taste in vape but you get a little harshness on the exhale using the bong. I can see this could be an A grade bud with a little work.
The high left a little to be desired. I felt a decent headrush after massive loads but the effects weren't very long lasting or intense. I...”"

I happened upon a bottle of AXE and thought "Wow, douchebags still buy this"? I then looked at the ingredient list and saw a bunch of really nice smelling aromas, confirmed after smelling the opened bottle. This strain reminds me of that. Its effects are ridiculous.

km1889,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fire-alien-kush/reviews/1358764,"“Picked up a quarter from a Medical Co Op in Tacoma. Smells very earthy. Kind of grassy. There's a pine scent with it too. Tastes about the same when smoked. It is definitely a 50/50 hybrid. It has the right body and head high ratio. I don't usually like hybrids and go either strait indica or strait Sativa, but this strain isn't bad. Good mix of both.”"
