SlamJam3000,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1696463,"“Ok so idk if this is actually a thing but if you find the right batch of this strain it literally smells like Garlic Mushroom & Onions aka GMO cookies. It's one of the wildest terp mixes I've smelled and boy does it pack a punch. Strong body, even stronger head and boy was I LIT”"
fartysmoker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1700284,"“this made me feel so relaxed. I was listening to  Jethro Tull and putting on lip balm. The lip balm felt so smooth against my lips and my lips felt like they were being moisturized and it felt so nice. I kept rubbing it on my lips and then I realized the song was almost over. My lips are really greasy, but I like it.”"
Skeezix25,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1696258,"“Strong body highs. Odd mix of feeling weightless/being pulled down. Body high in temples, top of the arms and shins.”"
PhoenixWrathBCG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1726331,"“After trying this as a pre-roll from a dispensary, I was surprised at the effects. Though I wasn't too fond of the flavor of the bud, the effects hit me at a hundred miles an hour. I was immediately glued to my chair and giggling like an idiot. The scent is very earthy, and the taste is very chemical-like. The high lasted about 3 hours for me from 1/2 a joint. Overall, I'd give it a 4, but just because of my taste pr...”"

Cheech-N-Chong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1709306,"“Strain is a heavy hitter, right after inhale you start to feel it set in and about 10 minutes later is when the eyes start to drop, this strain is normally high THC content... Beware beginners”"
CasketGang,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1743394,"“The smell might be as potent as its strength! As soon as I cracked it open I knew I had something special. Great for when the sun goes down. Definitely enjoyed this strain.”"
ultrapop,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1751022,"“There seems to be something regarding the cookies strain that I love, but it's from the indica side of things and this strain is just awesome! Put me to a blissful nights sleep. As for the taste it seems to have a pine style/earth terpine profile to it. Get this one when you see it.”"
JM524,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1729196,"“Intense smell, petrol/gas smell. Incredible bud structure, color, everything was on point. It’s a perfect blend of the Chemdawg and GSC. 5/5 all day”"

is at an acceptable level been searching for months to find something to help my pain that would keep up with tolerance issue and pain and GMO IS IT! It has an earthy sweet taste. best in Michigan #27Wellness”"
TheCannoisseur,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1771009,"“It's easy to get cynical about strain hype - is it truly like God is licking you, or just a well-done marketing scheme? 

After experiencing Gelato last week (a close relative of Cookies) it dawned on me: when it comes down to it, everyone is relatively the same. Strains don't get hype randomly; there is usually a distinct taste or effect that the strain provides. I'm thinking OG (that unique sour tang + weighty cere...”"

The_Entheogenist,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1715087,"“I tried Phat Panda's GMO Cookies.  It provided a healthy dose of uplift in mood and was nicely relaxing to the body while remaining totally functional.  It was a bit of a sneaky high in that I would forget, only to be hit by the sudden realization, "oh man... I'm pretty baked."  Not a bad high by any means, but I didn't really see anything to distinguish it from a dozen other strains.   And I expected it to hit harde...”"
Kollp2098,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1804605,"“A creeper where one puff will be good for hours! The first inhale will send warm feelings throughout your body before you even taste the amazing flavor profile that is sweet and earthy, very pungent, and a minor berry flavor.
For insomnia this is a perfect option, also for pain, appetite loss, and stress. Extreme cerebral and euphoric effects, take it slowly.”"
stacyb1076,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1779504,"“I am trying new strains all the time. Wow!!!!! Amazing!!!! Yep no words to describe the high you get. Word of advice, dont smoke this is you need to get stuff done. You will not get anything done.”"

Badinplaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1720565,"“the price they set here in AZ is not worth since there few others out there already that match the high.

Bud porn wise, Oh My Fucking God this is a beautiful flower, the smell is so unique and, it sparkles in the light.

DYI people, it has a great Kief count and makes solid resin.

so in all a good bud but there are other strains at a more reasonable price.”"

thegreenphoenixOG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1722958,"“GMO?? 
That was my first thought. 
But actually it’s probably in reference to the parents. Chemdawg+Girl Scout Cookie. 
Chemical Cookie=GMO Cookie.
After just one rip this is what my mind came up with. 
It taste great and functional.
Let’s end this review before the second one,”"

Definitely could not use during the day when I need to do something besides sit on the couch and nap, even getting up to use the bathroom takes a lot of prep talk. Doesn’t give me munchies at all. It tastes exactly what you would think garlic cookies would taste like, strong and bad. If I didn’t love this high so much I don’t think I wo...”"

Maudie0307,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1760029,"“I'm glad someone gave me some of this amazing bud. The smell was almost a garlic, mushroom, onion smell with a cookie finish. The smoke was the same ad the smell and man does this ever pack a punch.  One of my favorite strains by far.”"

Emer61,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1787786,"“Bought some recently based mainly on how amazing and gnarly the bud looked- chunky, dense, black/purple/orange over green buds. Some of the most beautiful buds ever, and great smell to boot.  1 bud in the 1/8 was 3.5g. The smoke has an amazingly oily density to it, with a strong cookie-like taste, but heavier flavor. Super potent- nice head/body balance. I’d have to say after 43 years of smoking, growing, trying doze...”"

rossinit,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1788373,"“Im having surgery to repair a torn gluteous minimus and the pain is pretty intense at times. This has enough of a euphoria to really dampen the lingering effects of pain. I'm dry vaping and its got a very interesting taste when the flame isn't a part of it. About 1/8 of a tsp of ground flour and it's relaxation for a few hours. EXCELLENT STRAIN!!”"
TheDillyDilly,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1805145,"“Great smoke. Lovely smell  and aroma that fills your nose with a tingling sensation. After a few hits you can feel it creep down your spine as it relaxes you from  top to bottom. Would definitely  recommend  for an evening smoke, still  light enough to stay up if wanted.”"
kaips1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gmo-cookies/reviews/1800169,"“I got the phenotype with a stronger mushroom than garlic but still had some onion too it. its been amazing and steadily become a top 10 strain in my book. it is pure get right.”"

Kinda reminds me of ranch dressing lol. The lingering after taste will make you crave Dr Pepper.”"
