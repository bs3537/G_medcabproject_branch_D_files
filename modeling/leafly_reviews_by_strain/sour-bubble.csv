Sour Bubble
=============
Napoleony36,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubble/reviews/1417144,"“You can smell the stuff from a mile away! The high slowly creeps up on you but then when it hits you it's nothing less then devastating, hits you hard! ( I'm fucked up but I'm cool with it though) then you start to settle down into an really chill/relaxing high. I definitely recommend smoking this after a long hard day working.”"
Shialaska,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubble/reviews/1197621,"“I have nerve pain and have had it for many years , first off the flavor is very yummy reminds me of popcorn in the feel.. After a few short hits my pain was gone and I did not need a lot the high I got for so little was like   Spongy feet . Love this strain I can't wait to get more!”"

In Roseburg if we have to purchase our med's, which I don't, as I have a caregiver who is good, it's only $160 oz. I like that!

You charge too much at $220 an oz.”"

Chimaera,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubble/reviews/1200468,"“Had a bunch of anxiety creep up during the day on top of neck and shoulder aches, took a few vape hits of this and I am comfortably melting into my couch. Nice tingles, relaxing and peaceful complacency sets in after longer than I would expect. Small, purple buds from Boston's Best Buds, great stuff.”"

sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubble/reviews/1731308,"“Indo connoisseur in WA has a sour bubble listed at 18.9% thc. Looks great. Mostly purple with shades of lime green nugs with lots of trich all over sharp pointed buds. Long scraggly orange hairs mixed in. Smells like burnt rubber. Tastes very sweet and slightly woody. Effects are some what mild. Relaxed, uplifted, and happy. Nerves felt like they melted. I may get this again. I recommend SB for getting normal.”"
HiRicoMN,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubble/reviews/1273184,"“Very good indica. 
HotBoxed a blunt of this strain at 11 pm with my wife and best friend. Get some sour in you're life. #HiRicoJ”"

Steely,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubble/reviews/1179429,"“I have met this breeder and his wife. They are wonderful people and dedicated to providing good genetics to us all. Sour Bubble is the flagship strain and one of the best medical strains out there.”"
C-Piszel,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubble/reviews/1431432,"“I miss this Strain. It's been about 2 years since I've had it and I still think about it. It taste so good sweet and sour aftertaste so you know you're smoking gas.”"
highdefnition,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubble/reviews/1241498,"“Love the smell this leaves in a room after burning. Nice mellow terps on this one, taste is familiar yet strange. Grapey and fruity with a hint of sweetness, this is great. Dark purple scattered throughout lime green, with really crystally sugar leafs surrounding it. This is a relaxing indica but still has some headiness behind it. Hard to find, but try it if you can track her down! Thanks, B.O.G this stuff rocks.”"
SenpaiDoesDrugs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubble/reviews/1352600,"“This is great. As soon as you take the first hit, you might taste sweet pine needle, at least I did. I was pretty skeptical about the dizziness users reported on the main page of the strain but I decided to try it. 3 bowls of this has me solid glued to my couch relaxed happy and everything just feels like eternal bliss. Thanks for this, you've helped a recurrent cancer patient with his severe anxiety and nausea.”"

abxabx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sour-bubble/reviews/1371578,"“Not a huge fan of this strain. It definitely hits hard, and can knock you out fast if you smoke for insomnia, but I don't recommend it for recreational use. It tends to make me feel way too heavy, bodily, particularly in my limbs, and slightly claustrophobic. 

It also hits strangely for me - it takes a while to kick in, so I usually smoke way too much, and when it finally hits, it's an all-at-once kind of thing. I p...”"
