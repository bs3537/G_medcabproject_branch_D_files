Mother's Milk

BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1390143,"“This review is on Mother's Milk shatter by Native Roots. Vail, Colorado 

First off, don't let the name scare you away.  If you do you're only missing out.  This strain doesn't scream milk to me.  It is sweet, earthy, and unique.  As far as effects go I completely disagree with Leafly's description of this strain.  The version I got at least was very indica dominant, 70/30 or so.  The first twenty minutes I fought to...”"
Med_can_user_Mel,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1380500,"“This strain is unique. I tried it several months ago but sadly only had a gram. When I found it again, I was ecstatic! It’s a wonderfully mellow hybrid that won’t knock you out, but will bring you to the most calming state of relaxation and euphoria. You forget your problems on this strain. Or perhaps they don’t seem so great. It’s made for depression and anxiety. I couldn’t agree more.

The flavor is milky and fruit...”"

Purchased at Buddy Boy Brands on 38th and Perry in Denver, Colorado. This strain is medically amazing. I was deadlock in the couch not able to move at all. Sorta like a morphine drip, but without all the nasty harmful who knows what. I have back pain, very painful. This strain for sure helped me with my pain. I also have Aspergers, and this s...”"

eymacassi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1375118,"“This stain was recommended to me by my budtender and was one of her favorite stains. I got it in shatter and dabbed it. The taste was awesome and the smoke was thick and creamy. It made me sneeze and my nose felt itchy afterwards, not sure what that's all about. The high was mind clearing. I could barely think enough to write this. I forgot how to think. Great for meditation. Body buzzing and heavy as a stone.”"
bbt15,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1392086,"“I consume this as a concentrate that I then vape.  It supplements my edibles which I use every day but around dinner.  It's a great strain for daytime use, and when you need a little extra without another edible.  Very good quality and a pleasant taste.”"
cersei4prez,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1423216,"“I was initially a bit put off by the smell of this one but after I smoked it I instantly fell in love with the strain. Quick take: your mom's lorazepam doesn't have shit on this herb. Also, maybe we shouldn't "trust our noses" as much as we previously thought (budtenders listen up). At first I thought it smelled like powdery herbal yet oddly creamy deodorant that maybe doesn't even exist except in my head? In any cas...”"
ryanks420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1379747,"“It tastes milky and sweet, makes you very relaxed and helps you sleep, sometime can make you talkative if you don't sleep but is a great strain”"

Trpn8r,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1733226,"“I will say unfortunately not all strains are the same so if you live in the area this is probably going to be close or the same as what you'll find. I want to state that I purchased my Mother's Milk from a local Las Vegas Dispensary. The breeder is Summa Cannabis. The buds are good sized, dense, and sticky. Aroma is piney and zesty. I give flavor an 8.8. The best word to describe is Sprite. It's a limey zest but diff...”"
MoBiscuits420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1494418,"“Great strain for insomnia and depression. The first time I smoked this strain I was impressed at it's ability to bring me back into my body. However, even though it's a potent one, it didn't couch lock me or overly sedate my body. I felt very warm and held, like a nurturing mother, which is why I felt it was emotionally uplifting.
Don't expect large dense nugs on this lady, she tends to bud in smaller little nugglets...”"
troyover9000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1499341,"“This strain is in my top 5. Though I smoke a whole blunt of milk from time to time, I've found that this strain works very well mixed with other strains so feel free to add a couple tiny nugglets of mother's milk.”"
Dmarieivy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1372324,"“I loved that chillin effect , but I get whitty ? 
Would be a great one to do with your mate , alittle more relaxed and aroused once it kicked fully in .

Very smooth let down , 2 pulls will give you a smooth up hill .. wait it out til you feel your body get more relaxed to understand how you'll feel . 


Very nice strand !!”"
sydquinn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1503332,"“definitely helps with soreness, but still a nice heady high”"
basskitten7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1660841,"“I am reviewing Native Root's extract purchased in Denver, Colorado. Mother's Milk is a potent couch lock hybrid. It leaves me feeling very euphoric and focused, yet has a strong sedating body load. It's great for headaches and lack of appetite, but this strain does leave me with some intense anxiety.”"
oneunited,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1520192,"“A great depression buster! One or two hits melt the heavy mood and provide a satisfying lift. The buds are among the frostiest I’ve seen and the aroma is unique as promised. Perfect for the long dark days of winter.”"
Meibolite,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1598699,"“Excellent choice for dry herb vaping. clear high without any tiredness after the initial high wears off”"
STL87,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1666959,"“Differently a must try, if you’ve never tried this unique strain. Don’t let the sativa dominant fool you, it has indica body high with a good heady sativa. Taste is sweet with a mild spice taste on the exhale. Overall GREAT HYBRID!!!”"
rsgibson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1631868,"“Very calming for me and good body relaxation. I had wax. Very good effect after one small hit.”"
Greenlion31,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1788304,"“This is a unique strain in itself when I first smelled it I noticed the strong smell. Not the strongest, but unique. I vape so putting some flower into the pax and you can taste it on your tongue more powdery. Don’t let that turn you off because when it hits you it doesn’t overwhelm or throw you into a panic attack. Last night I literally don’t remember falling a sleep because after it settles you sink into the couch...”"
cnc1998,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1330990,"“very nice, more on the indica side, left me sedated and falling asleep on mycouch. nice pointy buds with dark orange/brown hairs, the pistils are so covered in thc that it sometimes burns like hash or wax, smells like it too at points. taste is very earthy and creamy, with a hint of vanilla on the exhale. very nice for after work or evenings hanging out, especially if you want to go to sleep after.”"
hugh3000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1372095,"“Great hybrid, got me super blazed in a good way. Felt good and uplifted. Really helpful to relax and unwind. However it was super easy to lose focus. Definitely mellowed me out but no couch lock. This is a strain to chill and relax with.”"

JadedTakesThisSerious,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1303956,"“This one is alright.  For me it was mainly heady with some dry mouth,  probably not the best to go smoke an leave the house on.”"
MustyBrown,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mothers-milk/reviews/1374967,"“Great,  another fungicide-compatible commercial strain.   This one will be popular amongst growers for its ability to pass their dairy additives (organic mold/powdery mildew coverup trick) off as terpenes.   

I spend every dispensary visit avoiding milkweed and always ending up with it anyway.  Why is everyone trying to sell me "buttery"  weed?   I f'in hate milk! Im a grown ass adult. 

Now they just grow strains t...”"
