Lucy
=============
T.I.N.G.,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1396022,"“Awesome full body effect. It really helps with spasms and pain. It can make you a little sleepy.(if that's a problem mix in a little green crack and your good to go.)

The problem with this strain is consistency between batches. If you get a good batch, it is amazeballs. A bad batch and it's not much more than ditch weed. Look for higher THC ratings for better batches or buy a gram(THC testing isn't always representa...”"
ashes4me,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1410327,"“Introduced to me as a CO exclusive, I found myself saying I love Lucy just like the TV show. After many occasions with her she is one of my favorite anytime strains. Many people are misled by her being a CBD. That's the tricky thing with her she packs just as much of a punch as any good indica dominate hybrid. The lineage that she comes from couldn't come from better parents. I often recommend her to people looking t...”"

I have poly neuropathy and Glosidynia which are both very painful diseases tried a bowl last night before bed best night sleep I've had forever if anybody suffers severe chronic pain Lucy is the way to get a good night sleep if you have to you can always re-charge in the middle of the night with a few more tok...”"
lightweightlooser,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1388626,"“This is great! Such a nice wonderful strain that helps with calming soothing effects. AWESOME for light weights, smoke and enjoy while falling asleep with a peaceful mind set and body high”"
divinedragon80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1388623,"“I really like the Lucy ad a daytime anxiety reliever. I only wish it lasted a little bit longer. it is a very subtle high that leaves you fully functional. I have not experienced any paranoia on this strain.”"
AkaTeddd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1388625,"“Lucy have one tried 1 x but was very enjoyable gram that I picked up.I guess this was the first CBD strain I tried and was hooked like Pookie from New Jack City.
Love the feeling of CBD rich strain help's ease the mind and put the part's back together again.
I'm a huge fan of La confidential so helped me ease into this strain.”"
AkaTeddd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1388622,"“Lucy I'm home ! Love Lucy packs more of a punch like Sugar Ray Robinson! You can feel the Confidential shines thru just better w high cbd.Great feeling 
Immediate pain relief/anxiety relief had a great time getting out of house w/ this strain or being more social instead of isolating myself.5mg CBD Tinture in morning as well.
Taste and smell of confidential huge fan”"
hippylocs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1340799,"“I dig it... Makes me feel like an unbruised banana. Has a nice heady airy type buzz that it gives you. If I had for hands, I'd give it 4 thumbs up 👍”"
Ienjoymarijuana,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1388621,"“I picked up a gram of this strain in a joint, and it instantly became one of my favorites, smokes fairly smooth, made me feel relaxed, stress free, just a tad tired, felt it relieve the pain in my neck and lower back, I barely felt a head high, I would recommend this strain to anyone just starting out smoking or looking for a nice relaxed feeling without being hazey.”"
thehappyhorror,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1317311,"“I got this strain because I suffer from debilitating panic attacks and anxiety. It's basically Xanax in the form of weed. Almost immediately took away my anxiousness. I feel chill with no racing thoughts. I recommend Lucy for anyone who really wants the medical benefits only. I prefer a more giggly, stoney high. I already have a prescription for Xanax so I'd rather spend my money GSC and SkywalkerOG.”"
JennDub85053,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1394906,"“Very much a full body high, but not overly strong. I like the taste a lot. Lucy is probably my number, with Flo being my love. It's also a steady high for me, I'm kinda lightweight so two, three hits of this and I was good for a few hours.”"
poisonpink,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1397859,"“Was already a fan, but this recently helped me get some much needed rest after an ankle sprain and a panic attack that were keeping me up. It doesn't knock you out, but gently calms you down enough so you can relax.”"

Dread80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1297996,"“relaxes you and has a decent body high. definitely a day time. also not noted on the page was it's also anti anxiety.”"
Alicemaggie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1391168,"“A new favorite! What a sweet strain! Kind bud indeed. Bought to relieve a slew of nerve issues, It worked! Though it is 10%THC, the 10%CBD Kicks! My first exhale came with the words "oh, Beauty"! I Love Lucy!”"
jmedina1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1594444,"“This is by far the best strain I've found for my back spasms, inflammation, and disk problems. It melts away the pain. I can't wait to get home to my Lucy!”"
QuinGold,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1583868,"“Solid CBD strain, I really like this for headaches, though I’m sure when I have a migraine it would help as well. This is great for when your temples, jaw,neck and sinuses are in pain and your temples and auricularis muscles feel like a raw tangled mess. I strongly feel that Indica CBD’s are best for severe pain and sleep while Sativa’s help with anxiety and mild discomfort for work or daytime use.
 This is what I wa...”"

The sap is 10 times better then the flower even if you don't print the pictures I'm sending you'll have to be impressed with the ingenuity of it all😜”"
moonflower23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1705498,"“Legit strain, pleasurable robust flavor.  Great relaxing strain. Got in Medford Oregon Hijinx cannabis.”"
2DankFrank,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1559320,"“I would characterize this strain as a clear-headed, heavy indica.

One solid hit and I felt the effects creeping in over the next 5 minutes. Somewhat euphoric and body/head buzzy, lasting about an hour with full effects, and almost back to baseline after 90 minutes.

Very relaxing and eventually sleep inducing. 

Good for:
-Relaxation
-Sleep
-Appetite stimulation
-stress
-Doing nothing in particular

Not good for:
-U...”"

Ryno602,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1395404,"“This was an average batch had beautiful colored buds, the taste was sweet but the smell wasn't attractive, very grassy. The high was medium/mellow.”"

gayleadele,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1427994,"“Initial high is ok but comes to a halt quickly, so be ready to nap. I'm not a fan of hybrids or indicas but understand and appreciate the pain relief in this strain. It's not terrible and I would definitely use when my pain is kicking up.”"
runfast12,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1294560,"“Ya want to sleep? Well the batch I got did just that, that's what I got it for and man did it ever work. It's just hard to find. I loved it.”"

DJChronic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1350896,"“Being a high cbd fan, I found some of this locally and was excited to try it. Usually high cbd strains work great for my PTSD and panic anxiety, however this did little to nothing to mediate my symptoms. Rather disappointed, and tasted like moldy hay. Had some pain relief, but it was minimal and short lived.”"
RDS80209,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1328311,"“Throughly enjoyed this relaxed high. For me this was a great strain to do before bed.”"

bmt620,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lucy/reviews/1388627,"“Not high in THC at all not the greatest bud doesn't taste too good if you just like smoking to smoke then this is for you but if you want a nice high this one is like taking a couple Xanax boring and mundane”"
