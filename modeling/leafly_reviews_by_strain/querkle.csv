Querkle

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/querkle/reviews/1410423,"“This definitely hit me more as a sativa than an indica. I felt the head high way more than the body which was a good experience. I felt super heightened awareness about everything around me and noticed things that I normally wouldn't about people. This is not a good weed to smoke if you want to interact with big groups, it's really good to meditate with and be alone with your thoughts or have a deep conversation with...”"
silkroadtravler,https://www.leafly.com/indica/querkle/reviews/1390627,"“Totally great choice, you will wish you had more! Querkle is a very intense mood elevator. It gets you there without the heavy loss of energy. In fact, I think it is somewhat energizing even though it is great as a nightcap to help sleep deeply. Querkle is a bit psychedelic, enhancing colors and flavors making your experience of life more enjoyable. This is one of my top ten choices overall.”"
JacobbTG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/querkle/reviews/1415426,"“This is quite the unique strain I must say. The smoke was a bit harsh, but the effects were very different than from what I've experienced in other strains, and especially for an Indica dominant strain. Querkle is without a doubt the most uplifting strain
I've experienced, but without being overbearing, sedating or couch locking. It simply just brings up your happiness levels, I found my thoughts automatically optimi...”"

I used to be totally into sativa buds, but that was cause I was addicted to spice at the time and preferred the "trippy speedy" head high. But then I came across the worst pain I ever felt; irritable bowel syndrome. It's going to eventually progress to chron's disease, but even now cramping and muscle spasms and pain are among the symptoms. My dispensary's owners daughter tol...”"

Helped me with inflammation, headaches, tension and trouble sleeping. If you have things to do during the day like work, appointments, errands.. I would not use Querkle as it hits me more as of an Indica than a Sativa.

Things were bright and everything seemed just out of my reach. Near the peak, I started to get a bad case of the super munchies for everything that smelled delicious.

The 20% sativa is apparent and this is not as foggy as some other strong indicas, but it will definitely put you out if you let it. It's the perfect strain for unwinding and melting into the couch while allowing you to stay awake to enjoy a book... at least for a little while. The immediate high is more full-body-loosening than sleepy, but...”"
