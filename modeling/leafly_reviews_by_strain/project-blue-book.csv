It has both a calming cerebral effect as well as a tingly body buzz. I found the pain relief for this strain to be fairly good too.

An also amazing taste to it, almost tasted like a kush after taste. The effects were quick and made me feel very uplifted and energetic. Would def recommend to others to try this strain.”"
