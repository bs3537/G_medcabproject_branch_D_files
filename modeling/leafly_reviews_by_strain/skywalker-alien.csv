=============
HyTheWeedMonk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skywalker-alien/reviews/1670385,"“Earthy and Nutty (almonds in particular), quite easy to take a lot of quick small-medium hits without any problem, big hits will fuck your throat because it’s really potent, flavor is easy to find and lasts for a really long time after you’ve had 3-5 hits. 

No headaches, full stress less, kills quite a lot of pain, time moves extremely slow. Munchies are there but if you’re experienced you can control if you're semi...”"

Liaisonsunivers,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skywalker-alien/reviews/1768253,"“swallows a little bit of a downer on the Indica it was definitely giving me some surreal effects and some I guess graphic imaginatory vision, however Skywalker kind of feels when it comes to maintaining some of the hyper-focus on the cerebral side although it does will help out with muscle spasms and keep you pretty mellow throughout the entire High.”"
