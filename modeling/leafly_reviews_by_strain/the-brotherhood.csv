It was a creeping kind of high - started mellow and ramped up. Felt alert and no couch lock, but was a little distracted. Enjoyed this one a lot and would have it again.”"

Felt happy and buzzed but not to the point where I could not function. I’m a heavy hitter so take it lightly if ur new or just a light weight. Gave the munchies...”"

But I also took hits then went to bed and was groggy the next morning. It is a lasting high that’s better for activities, I wasn’t stuck or mind racing effects so that’s a plus for this day preferred strain, idk wake n bake I guess. Not an all around strain I prefer but I’d pick it up again if I have the chance.”"
