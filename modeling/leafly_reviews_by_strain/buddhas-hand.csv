Very calming and yet your mind stays active and you are focused. No paranoia but I do feel speedy... like I drank a little too much coffee... but without any of the nervousness.

AAron_Balakay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/buddhas-hand/reviews/1586902,"“I like this strain. It's a good slightly sativa dominant hybrid for the morning and early afternoon.

Damask78,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/buddhas-hand/reviews/1396019,"“I thought this was more chilled and laid back than what it was advertising to be. I definitely didn't feel energetic or uplifted. I wanted to sleep and relax more than anything. It has a great taste and smooth, just not very sativafied.”"

Ultimate86Man,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/buddhas-hand/reviews/1773714,"“A Hybrid choice for Seattle CannaCon 2019! By Sensimilla, Buddha's Hand is a day-time hybrid and also a God bud being the God of Wisdom along with a very similar high as Laughing Buddha. If you don't have Jesus OG or Laughing Buddha, try this one!”"
