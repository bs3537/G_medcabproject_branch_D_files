Hit my bong about 20 minutes ago and I feel like my normal self, but in the best mood possible. Smoking this weed makes you feel like you're walking down the street, wearing your favorite outfit and crushing life.”"

TBIInsider,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1410936,"“I was in Crested Butte for the past holiday weekend and picked up an 1/8 at SOMA Colorado. In no hurry I stopped by after their skier rush, if there is such a thing in The Butte.
I picked the highest elevation shelf they had and was presented with this Alien. Upon further review this Alien is added to my A List, no1. 
As In: All Time. 
High CBD and low THC?  Ya Buddy or so I thought, pleasant head effect for 15.3% TH...”"
hannahfoshiz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1413537,"“Great strain for relaxation and pain. Gradually took my migraine away and relaxed me. Good for resting for sleep but didn't put you to sleep. This weed also made me talkative and tunnel visoned but focused. Smoooooooth. New fave for medicating”"
beezonks,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1410934,"“My medical strain is cloned from this. Great for daytime use. Energized and focused without anxiety or being too "uppity". Great for nausea.”"
MPhelps,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1410938,"“Smoked a bowl of this pretty nice flavor the high was kind of brief but was nice while it lasted!”"
Lazarus420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1410935,"“the strain I tried was out of a CT medical dispensary(Theraplant 14006)... it was crossed w tangerine kush. THC just under 25% and high cbd as well. I found it to be very potent and effective! great smell reminiscent of the older haze strains,and a flavor to match. would definitely recommend this strain for most anyone, particularly those looking for a heavy high”"

LEQCANNASOINS,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1422656,"“I have just received a super care package from a great old friend which contained 6, 3/4 of pounds of 6 strains that I've never tried nor heard of.  I had, but almost missed in the packaging were laboratory tests of each strain, as my super-friend knows full well that I love them.  So I will be making 6 Leafy Strain Reviews of these six strains 

The first tried strain is Tahoe Alien a hybrid strain of Tahoe OG x Ali...”"
Caleb314,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1255775,"“Great taste and high. Taste like lemony pine sol at first but once it burns a little tast like lemony earthy wood/green tea. The high hits you hard in waves everywhere and makes you laugh your ass off. Definitely worth trying but its more for evening or late night use as it leaves you sleepy.”"
thunderbuns,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1392125,"“I definitely appreciate this strain. Doesn't exactly knock me on my butt. It doesn't make me productive either. It did produce a lovely high, giggly and fun, but also chill. I feel like this is a good strain when you're being social at home. I love the piney sweetness.”"
mahaadjohnson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1410937,"“I had some delivered to my job,I could not hide the smell. I had it tucked in my sock+covered by 4 layers(thermals,flannel pjs,sweats,jeans) of pants....my coworkers said they smelled it. Had to stash it outside. I was finally off of work and rolled one up,here it is hours later and I just came to like "what happened? Last thing I remember was leaning back getting comfy"”"
mskingrio,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1308704,"“smoked this once and can't wait for it to come around again. this high had me giggling and eating like crazy. 9/10, if not 10/10 high. would suggest for a party perhaps”"

cyanbeaver,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1614206,"“I’d have to say that Tahoe Alien comes in a very close second to Blue Dreams. Definitely a staple strain to have”"

roxxxyroller,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1255492,"“This is a definite OMG strain for me. I prefer it over many of the more expensive  ones (another reason it's one of my favorites). Only down side for me is that the munchies get huge. A great trait for those needing appetite stimulation. A++”"

jennifer.garuti,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1145880,"“I had this strain crossed with Sour Grapes from my dispensary. For some strange reason Ct does not like to name the strains unless it's called Theraplant 1009. But with a thc content of 23.8%, how can you complain? The sativa hits you immediately followed by a calming relaxing high. Great for depression, anxiety,ADHD,lack of appetite. Great earthy smell.”"

ript2shrds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1373092,"“The buds of this Tahoe Alien from Kind Love in Denver are completely covered in sticky amber trichomes. The weed smells so freaking good and the high is stoney and relaxing. After only one bowl was plenty relaxed and ready to zone out watching netflix, knowing full well I'd not be able to follow any storyline being this high.”"

NaturesWayMedicine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1719907,"“Tahoe Alien is a favorite among patients who have tried it for cancer, headaches, inflammation, chronic pain, insomnia, nausea, and muscle spasms or tremors. They enjoy its relaxing effects. Tahoe Aliens buds are large and stocky and are very sticky due to the frosty layer of golden trichomes. The flavor and aroma of this flower is very earthy and piney that patients find enjoyable.”"
OldToby214,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1641460,"“I think this is a very good strain. It's buds have a very resin like feel to them, sticky icky to the max. I have been vaping this strain for a couple months and I find that is a great evening strain. Whenever it is vaped through my PAX I feel totally couch locked. The pain relief I get from this strain is very comparable to that of high CBD and pure indica & sativa strains. A draw back of this is that it makes my ey...”"

tattooed11bravo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1224735,"“I have only used a very small amount of this strain. From The amount I tried I liked the effects. I think it will be some nice for mid-day or evening. The color reminds me of mustard and has a potent earthly smell.”"
August_Sky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1206552,"“This strain worked wonders on me in all levels. Super relaxed and uplifted. Strong body high as well as a nice head high.

CaptainQuazar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1773755,"“My Tahoe Alien from Ilera was mediocre. I normally look for strains with a higher THC content (over 20% if possible), but got this by mistake. It only had 12%. An earthy flavor, relaxing but not over-powering. Good for evening when you don't want a "heavy" indica, but want to chill. Pairs with curling.”"
moocru,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-alien/reviews/1391951,"“People from CT need to stop giving reviews! CT has never had just Tahoe Alien at its dispensaries, only strains that included the Tahoe Alien as a parent.. Therefore none of your reviews are valid!
Tahoe Alien is an amazing strain that takes on a good 50/50 mix of its parents in both high and appearance/smell...
When u break it open you'll notice some of the purple in there from the purple kush lineage. One of my fav...”"
