Stealth13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tembo-kush/reviews/1191073,"“This is some value bud I picked up and was very pleasantly surprised how lifted I got from smoking so little. Seems to smoke like a straight Sativa, sweet smelling with a nice energetic kick.”"
Mikechronic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tembo-kush/reviews/1183830,"“I bought a oz of this at Seattle Tonics 
for $240 I was amazed by the deal I got.
this stuff could be easily $300. This is some great hydro. I will be back for more i love Durban poison and I definitely get more Durban than kush in this strain.”"
Magnumb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tembo-kush/reviews/1197343,"“wow this strain is great. smells really good and smokes smooth. full of hairs and crystals, everyone I have let try this strain has loved it. I will be buying more. thank you Buds in pasco.”"
DEFIANTDWELLER,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tembo-kush/reviews/1238463,"“I found it and it was called mammoth.  I searched this site and this is what the search came up with. It sounds identical to what I have I guess the strain died out but it's nice to know that it's still out there somewhere because it worked well for me. So I don't ramble on I will get to the review if you guys don't approve of it you guys can take it down I don't care just trying to give me $0.02

SmokeYourGirlsPantsOff,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tembo-kush/reviews/1259256,"“When I got this bud it was called Og Mammoth but every other review and the way the sit talks about it sounds like this bud. I love this bud. Smokes you out for just a small about. And works great in a grinder. But the density is weird. I got fluffy  nugs and extremely dense nugs. Would recommend this bud.”"
