This stuff made me like everyone and positive and upbeat like I ate a cloud and rainbows or something.  DANK DANK DANK.  I barely even took two hits and I was already like smiling.”"
bellanet,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1414163,"“This is an exceptional strain with a very high THC level. I haven't felt this nice in quite a long time. So much so, I was compelled to leave a review. You will remember this strain and you will ask for it again when your out.”"
pp2625,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1414164,"“My grandmother used to eat grapefruit every morning....I bring that up because with this flower I feel like I am joining that tradition...well ...in a way....an earthy smell and taste with a grapefruit splash at the end...tasty....more of a mellow yet focused slump feeling then I would prefer from a morning  smoke.....but late in the day as you transition to indicas? Perfect. Coughy 3/10 chillum.”"
chocomallow,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1414166,"“So great for starting the day and definitely has all the things I love in a sativa strain. I'm out here sending good vibes right and left... This strain makes you wanna goof off and have fun with life...Yet you stay clear headed and are still able to focus. Great stuff, one of the best the pnw has to offer. Bonus: made friends with a praying mantis!”"
petethekoala,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1414165,"“I love this strain. The complexity of it's taste is one of my main reason for this love. It smells like pine and a mossy earth. Taste like pine and flowers with a grapefruit aftertaste.  The buzz is like a stairway and is relatively strong but very manageable, even for beginners. It starts as an head buzz that gradually grow stronger for an hour an a half. You talk a lot during that first period as you become very ha...”"
Luxamillian,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1360491,"“Nepalese gives me a good, happy, relaxing high without the couch lock feeling that I sometimes get with other strains that relax me. I can smoke this and go outside, do some crafting, hold decent conversations without forgetting what I was saying. 

Great daytime strain.”"
Crespalin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1345247,"“Perfect sativa, 
Doesn't gives me anxiety so I can smoke all day without having paranoid or anxiety attacks. It hits you with a very woody fruity flavor”"
Cthulhu67,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1222131,"“Quarter oz from the dispensary.  No ceiling.  Made butter out of most of it, vaped the rest.  With edibles made from this, be careful kids, you can get way more high than you may be used to.”"
BowlsOPlenty,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1586262,"“I got these INCREDIBLY phat chunky nugs from a local grower. Grown Outdoors these buds are giants! He showed me one that weighed roughly 9 grams, dried😲. The flowers themselves are a beautiful combination of the sweet and the skunk that I think we all have come to love. Definitely a great strain!
The only down⬇side is because it was grown Outdoors there's little trichomes on the outside when you crack open an nug yo...”"

LEQCANNASOINS,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1490575,"“I have just received a care package with one hell of a favourite Hash in the Whole Planet Nepalese Temple Balls from One of my Sweetest Danish Cannabis Goddess who has sent me such mind blowing treats for the past fifteen years.  We met on a House Boat. which was on a Canal one from the Red Light District of Amsterdam.  We hit it off hugely and she makes regular pilgrimages to Montreal every Cannamas to stay with My ...”"
Zikander,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1732540,"“I'm a veteran that suffers from chronic depression due TBI and have chronic physical pain.
Nepalese changed my life. I feel better. The pains have diminished as well as the depression. So, while in the euphoric state everything id beautiful and I feel great gratitude. I lock that thought and as I come down ready for sleep. I sleep better than before. From 2 hypervigilance to now 6 hours of rest.”"
TheMusicMaker,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1345245,"“If you can get your paws on this original sativa landrace hailing from Nepal, you will experience something most users, recreational and medicinal, will never experience. This is a pure sativa with fruity notes and high psychoactive potency. Moreover, it is also a parent of the infamous Chemdog (allegedly), when bred with another geographically close landrace, Thai (or Thai sticks).”"
musicmarijuana,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1345244,"“Great for work, studying, going out, doing things that require a little more attention. A light, content high that leaves me feeling a little sleepy but overall joyful and relaxed.”"
freekyashu,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1615072,"“Well, there are different strains in Nepal, mostly Sativa. These are really sweet in berry like smell with lovely resin covered buds. Smoke one heavily and it will give you a cough lock for sure. Giggly and somewhat Psychoactive. 
Though you need to get the true Nepalese landrace. 
BOOM BHOLENATH!!”"
sfgiantsfan40,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1418105,"“A favorite of Howard Marks, so not much else really needs to be said after that in my humble opinion. Just go out and try it, and you will not be disappointed.”"

Ballzley,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1135389,"“Very strong / no ceiling.  Can be extremely euphoric to the point of dizziness, so gauge yourself. I took one hit too much, and I was sitting like a bum on the porch until I had to rush to the bathroom to upchuck! Head was spinning.  On previous, more responsible instances, it's great for daytime mundane tasks like cleaning the house or doing chocolate writing homework. Nicely mannicured, grown, and trimmed, slightly...”"

Shindou,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1317685,"“Loved this strain but have to leave a warning, 10 minutes after my vapes bowl I was instantly hard, like painfully so...SO glad I was alone and it was night time. After that it was wonderful and relaxing, took my stress away completely, which was what I needed. I was a bit forgetful, which was new for me, but not in a hazardous way, like forgetting I drank my tea 15 minutes ago. Overall, great strain for stress, pain...”"
kaylamarie,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1171479,"“I get this in a pre-rolled form at my local dispensary and I love it. Very nice calming high, and positive as well, it does make me talkative and theres a slight body tingle.”"

mishellja,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1367309,"“Strong fruity smell, and very sticky. I def felt in control during my high but I tended to focus on very minute things. It's Energizing in the sense that it helps you get up out of bed to do stuff. Super helpful when it comes to alleviating anxiety. I thought I would enjoy it more but I lacked feeling the euphoric rush or the giggles. I just end up fixating on stuff and focused on performing physical tasks. Very chil...”"

Dorje108,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1563695,"“Having smoked it naturally grown in Nepal, I know this is as good bud. Not a pure sativa either, very relaxing, some definite indica influence.”"
auzzylove,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nepalese/reviews/1435144,"“I didn't realize the effects tended to be indica- this -ish put me on the couch. But don't worry, I was up again after about 2 hours! Beast looking weed I have ever seen in my life. Nugs like the inside of crystal covered caverns. Smells great too. Try it out, but save it for after dinner!”"
