*brand is Liberty Reach which says its a hybrid with 24% thc.

Vaporized in a Da Buddha 

Low odor, nice pleasant taste, not overly citrus, smells a bit like oranges when you open the jar. I had never been a big fan of tangje before but the mix of the golden calyx is really nice.

Very relaxing, cut through any stress I had in my head. Smooth onset of relaxation, foc...”"

Very spacey high; not exactly “focusing” or “energetically”-inclined. A little bit of couch lock, actually.”"

Was looking for something specifically to give us that boost after arriving after 11pm..and man...the happy head high hit immediately. Walked for miles smiling and laughing with the wife feeling great...put us both in a great mood after almost having cancelled our trip. 

And check this.....”"

I didn't experience any arousal, but wasn't using it for that so I really didn't care.  great strain for the day, where you can do your work, and be happy in the process.”"

I will admit that I am very new to cannabis and this was one of my first few times smoking. I did not feel any energetic feelings or any focus, but it was very relaxing and calming.”"

I do have a high tolerance but this bud wasn't the super sativa I thought It was gonna be. I hardly felt any real uplifting or euphoric effects. This strain did relax me but I prefer heavy OG strains or gorilla glue if I'm going for couch lock.”"
