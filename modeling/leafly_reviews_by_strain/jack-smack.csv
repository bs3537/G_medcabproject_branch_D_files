KushMage,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-smack/reviews/1336096,"“I'm personally a huge fan of Jack Herer and this bud smells strong with the Herer. Has that super sharp, poignant smell and has a very smooth taste that leaves your taste buds wanting an encore. The mind is sharp and induces a rush of positivity, creativity, and leaves an energetic trail that lingers long enough to get things done during the day”"
