The master is not to be taken lightly. In fact, if master OG and I were to go in a boxing ring together, OG would hand me my ass and a pillow and just because he's a gentlemen he would get me the Doritos too....”"

I got it from Greendaze in Danville, CA and it was some extremely awesome medicine.  Highly recommend trying it - it's crystally with a VERY kushy smell and it has a wonderful smooth kush aftertaste and great initial head high that melts into a soothing body high.”"
blakglasses,https://www.leafly.com/indica/master-og/reviews/1340061,"“A five-star strain.

The buds were covered in trichomes, very sticky. A beautiful strain to look at.

The smell is immediate, even through a ziplock bag. It's very dank; a potent skunky smell. It has a slight peppery aroma, as well.

It hits a bit harsh. Taking big hits will make you cough up a good one.

The taste is a nutty to dirt-like flavor; very earthy. 

The effects start off all in your head. A very, very pot...”"

Since this was their only $5 indica, I didn't even bother to smell it. Closer inspection of the buds didn't real too many trichromes on the larger leaves, but further inspection revealed a heavy build up in the center. The smell was pure lemon and pine as to be expected by most kush strains. It may have been puffy and felt dry, but this strain rol...”"
deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/master-og/reviews/1387195,"“🌬😴 Master O.G. is more resemblant to a Kush than it is an O.G. Nice, dark green with deep orange hairs and classic earthy smell to it. This strain is a pretty nice indica dominant hybrid with nothing too special about it. It seems to be a prime candidate for slipping into a deep relaxation and not a strain you would want to smoke before work. I personally feel it doesn't compete with the sedation of a nicely grown ...”"

This is a do-nothing strain. It's taking me a very long time to write this review because I keep getting distracted and falling into google search holes. I feel great though. I want to say it takes about half an hour to settle into a genuine body high. A little rough on the throat. Paranoia level: 1/10.”"
