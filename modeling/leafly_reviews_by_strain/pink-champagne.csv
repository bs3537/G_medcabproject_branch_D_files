k-lude,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-champagne/reviews/1353626,"“I tried this strain and it turned my pain grimace into a smile. It screamed, "Up and at 'em! Come on let's go take on whatever the world throws at me! I am gonna move mountains and..." Then I fell asleep on the couch.”"
jenifer44,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-champagne/reviews/1525989,"“Pink Champagne is a great Indica if you don't want to be totally couch locked.  It gives you the relaxation and euphoria, even in the worse of moods.  I hope this helps.  I have got a lot going on from a complex family situation and this is helping me cope.  Cheers!!  Hope this helps.  A really good Indica, imo.  Enjoy.”"

Heliosphan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-champagne/reviews/1412546,"“Legit. Each thick, dense nug is full of delicious tasting weed. It kind of has a fruit/berry kind of taste that's hard to precisely describe. It's definitely an indica -- I fell asleep watching Netflix hours before I normally fall asleep.”"

the buds also smell like a fucking bakery.. like muffins or donuts or even a pb&j. i could also see this as a great wake & bake weed or a before bed jay to make me chill out.”"

TwistedRose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-champagne/reviews/1574423,"“She’s so fine. 

Firm and dense and very sticky, she smells sweet and skunky. 

The first puff was like a sweet dream, she’s so earthy, woodsy, like sitting in the dim forest surrounded by deep mossy loam and the sound of raindrops on shaking ferns. My surprise and joy at her flavor joins with the wave of calm contentment that starts in my limbs and reaches my head in a crashing wave. More puffs follow, smooth milky ...”"
jenifer44,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-champagne/reviews/1523935,"“I love Indicas for the evening when I really want to relax.  This is such a nice mellow, long lasting high that will put a smile on your face and maybe make you listen to some music or hang with that someone special.  Really relaxing and uplifting, but will send you to bed if you smoke too much. No paranoia, just mellow.  Cheers!!  Enjoy”"
anxietygurl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-champagne/reviews/1336667,"“Great strain, an indica dominant hybrid that doesn't trip me up a lot but gives me energy joy and relaxation during social events. I find I can open myself more on this strain. Doesn't keep me up all night but doesn't knock me out either. Hope to see more positive results from other users in the near future!”"
Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-champagne/reviews/1296253,"“Really nice Indica.  Classic in its effects, but a little more complex than a straight up Indica.  Great for just hanging out with friends because while it is relaxing, it doesn't put you to sleep.  Great flavor and taste as well.  Fruity. grapey, berry with some breadiness/yeast.”"

It has a  skunky piney sweet smell. Tastes great in a pipe. I was surprised to find out that the THC percentage was only 10-15%, but feels like more,awesome for nighttime. It is light green with with orange hairs also has some purple all throughout.”"

Prodigy313,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-champagne/reviews/1627436,"“Extremely rare and hard to find but worth it, hands down one of the best strains I have ever smoked, smoked it through my PAX vaporizer. Lush resinous budd with a Berry note, definitely one of the most legendary strains I've ever tried. I highly recommend this one for people with bad migranes. GDP does it again!”"

orthanc1940,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-champagne/reviews/1382994,"“I absolutely cannot get over the smell. it might be hard to believe but the taste is even better, very sweet. Excellent for pain, Ive got a rotator cuff injury (shoulder) and this strain made me forget all about it. I did get some of that "couch lock" feeling but it isnt overwhelming, great strain to chill/relax and smoke but not something that sends me into the realm of slumber. 9/10 would buy again.”"
