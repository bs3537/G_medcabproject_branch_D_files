You would think from the smell it would be the strongest medicine ever grown. Very very pungent and not an easy smoke to hide if you have too. This is happy uplifting smoke with a great body high.”"
Krendle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/monolith/reviews/1385113,"“Immediate cerebral state. Had to take a moment to get my head straight after one hit. Really really smelly stuff. Lots of bright orange hairs. Pleasent in a lot of ways. Totally a stress reliever.”"

The buds are not the highest quality, the most dense, or the highest thc but it makes one feel amazing. Its a very relaxing body high yet with an uplifting euphoria and creativity that is very pleasant. The aroma is amazing as well and it makes me have a very vivid imagination which my friends have noted as well. It's not a well known strain but it is certainly a very good one”"

The buds aren't the best or have the highest thc content but it makes one feel amazing and have a super vivid imagination. Its very relaxing but with an excitement for things. Its also not too bad of a couch glue stick for an indica. One can still get up and have fun yet be relaxed. Its not a well known strain but its a good one.”"
