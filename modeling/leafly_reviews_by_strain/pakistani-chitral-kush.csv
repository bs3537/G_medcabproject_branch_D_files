The purple on this strain is amazing. very little green and tons of trichomes”"
jochexum,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pakistani-chitral-kush/reviews/1361854,"“One of my favorites. Smell and taste on the mild side. High is the most calming I've ever experienced and comes on almost immediately. Good body high but doesn't knock you out. Just makes everything feel alright - not euphoric or energetic so much, just totally calm and content, like all is right with the world.”"

It's a fantastic heavy body stone that I really enjoy because it has the heavy painkiller effects that I need at night.

The buzz is a good indica headbuzz, nothing too strong as it was tested at 16% THC, but definitely something that will get you in the mood to play video games or watch a good movie.”"

The lack of any noticeable sativa influence makes for a very calming, deceptively strong creeper of a buzz. Not necessarily total couch lock, but you won't want to move too far! 

Extremely enjoyable and delicious.”"
