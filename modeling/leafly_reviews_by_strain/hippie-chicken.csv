No anxiety/paranoia (an absolute must for me). Body high allowed me to get some cleanin done & eat lunch. Head high was energetic/creative which is exactly what I wanted, High lasted bout 4 hours which was very nice. I'd recommend Hippie Chicken for daytime use for nausea. :-)”"

Very sativa dominant, psychadelic, laughing about everything.  Indica undertones with body tingles, but no couchlock.  Nice stuff!!  Can be a little cotton-mouthy though.”"

My depression or when I want a good girls night out. Not overly clouding so great for before work. I cannot live without hippie chicken. It has changed my life. Concentrate form taste the best. Flower can be a bit rough. Nothing compares to the giggles you get on this.”"

tsidener,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hippie-chicken/reviews/1283169,"“Great sativa to use of you need to get stuff done. I obtained it in bubble hash form and pressed it into rosin. It's taste is pretty mild but the effects take hold quickly and greatly.  I don't recommend dabbing it if you're new to concentrates, it can be overwhelming.”"
HighSociety,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hippie-chicken/reviews/1234898,"“Muy bueno! Smoked flower and shatter. Definitely A#1 in my book. Sativa high that allows you to function and groove with your day/activity. Very intense but not in a couch lock/'I can't deal with this man', just a quality high. Like top shelf tequila, intensely jazzy without being a club to the head.”"

After a bit I get pretty hungry. Sometimes it makes me feel slightly paranoid/anxious, but that's a rare occurrence.”"

Got this gram of this amazing sativa for 13$ which is spendy but worth it; smells Super sweet with a light hint citrus and one of the most cerebral and intense but calming high I've ever had with a nice 22% thc content.

Definitely very smiley, giggly, and talkative.
No couch lock or sedation, so really good for going on relaxed adventures, but I did find that overwhelming environments (Busy/crowded or noisy) could be a little uncomfortable or over the top.”"
