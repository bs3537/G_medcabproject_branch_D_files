wearebestfwends,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-wreck/reviews/1413616,"“The CBDs are great for pain, anxiety, and depression. The THC gives a nice energetic boost. This is great for all day/morning/get shit done because it leaves you clear headed, focused, and energized. I would choose this over Harlequin because it managed my pain more effectively and much longer.”"

I was never a big fan of either Girl Scout Cookies or Trainwreck alone but TOGETHER! What a great ride. The bud itself is nice, not particularly dense, super earthy smell and pull.

Pros: Euphoria. Definite head effects that start behind the eyes that lead to ephoric, happiness. Mild pain relief.

Cons: Dry mouth and eyes. 

Overall/Other:  Head high is almost too intense, while euphoric, I also felt "spacey" and unfocused in my thoughts. (like having to really focus on writing down this review). Some munchies. Not couch locked, but more tired/lethargic...”"

Effects from the GSC and the TW come immediately but those from the GSC are more cerebral, and therefore many would find them more noticeable (naturally...if it's in the mind it's on the mind, whereas TW has a  more environmental and physical center of operations).

As soon as I ground the buds up I could smell the cookie like aroma.. The buds when ground up come to a very satisfying fluffy flower with the scents of cookie, sweet, mint, earthy.

Definitely has an earthy/woody smell and taste to it, but surprisingly sweet, sort of fruity notes noticeable on exhale. 

If you come across this powerhouse, DON'T sleep on it! A stand out strain for sure.”"
