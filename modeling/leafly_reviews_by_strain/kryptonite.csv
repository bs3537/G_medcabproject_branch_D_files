As I suck on the tithe of Mother Teresa herself, I cannot stand to realize that I am a left-handed man in a right-handed world. I peak on the edge of justice and liberty and feel as free as the eagle on a freshly minted quarter.

tokerlip,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kryptonite/reviews/1168775,"‚ÄúThis my first time using this strain it has an earthy taste and smell. Seems fairly potent but not as strong as other reviewers have suggested. A decent evening strain.‚Äù"
ladytiabug2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kryptonite/reviews/1196963,"‚ÄúDefinitely a calming strain. Mellowed me out for sure and all my worries subsided. I like the heaviness to it, and it tasted beautiful. Definitely a permanent favorite!‚Äù"

Torontofoodbwoy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kryptonite/reviews/1245113,"‚ÄúMaybe the buds I had did not come from a good grow but the high was very light, even too light for a daytime high. Large amount of crystals but whats the point if they don't get you high?‚Äù"
lilsammy2x,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kryptonite/reviews/1276248,"‚ÄúGreat tasting strain. Its smooth. pungent smell earthy too. Medical wise i say it helps with anxiety, pain , insomnia and stress. I have anxiety and insomnia so that's why i liked it. The reason no 5 stars is becuase i find the high lacking, this still had my eyes low and fuzzy but head high not really there. That's to be expected with a indica vs. sativa tho.‚Äù"
NerdyGamerGirl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kryptonite/reviews/1376838,"‚ÄúThis was The WORST strain I ever vaped/smoked!
First it gave me the worst  anxiety ever in this listing at least 12 hours. I take medical cannabis for chronic pain, to help relax, and for sleep too. It made the pain worse and I could not sleep. It was horrble!‚Äù"

zenwolfstorm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kryptonite/reviews/1310001,"‚ÄúFor people with pain, this strain will ease you down that scale of pain down to a tolerable level. It has benefits of an indica, that melt away the pain from back, headache, joint pain, muscle pain. Also, this strain is great for sleep and a very useful anti anxiety variety. I recommend this to anyone that has a tolerance well built and is in need of some reliable relief. When grown with a form of blackstrap derivati...‚Äù"

hkh5,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kryptonite/reviews/1234093,"‚ÄúSolid strain for insomnia, especially for a vape pen cartridge. Very very heavy head and body high, doesn't take much before you're out cold. Minimal/slight munchies which is also a plus for nighttime strains - there are some but it's more manageable with this strain. Definitely recommend for anxiety/insomnia.‚Äù"
