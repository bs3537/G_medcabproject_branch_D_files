csufjeff,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-thai/reviews/1374416,"“To Y'all who have chronic pain,

This is the strain for pain. I have arthiritis, gout and chronic pain.
Pineapple Thai saved my life. It is cheap some times, because the high is reduced by the high CBD and its wonderful anti inflammitory properties. Don't sell this one short it is the medicine for pain and a functional life, with pain and anxiety.
For those who might care this is a high producer strain, according...”"
heffie,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-thai/reviews/1370634,"“Pineapple Thai is a high-CBD strain (5% to 7% CBD, low THC). The "stoned" effects are the lightest I've ever experienced, and the calming effects of this strain are amazing. For medical/theraputic purposes, this is the best strain I've ever found.”"

LOL I picked some up from a spot in SJ-CA. I went in looking for Pineapple Express and the bud tender suggested Pineapple Thai. I had never heard of it before. The best part was, it was in the bargain bin. After smoking it, I not sure why? Wow, Pineapple Thai smells so sweet and sugary. If Willy Wonka grew marijuana this is what it w...”"

1. Those who got "pineapple thai" that wasn't really pineapple thai (lol)

2. Dumb pot heads who only smoke to get high.

If your looking to get super high this is not the strain. since the REAL strain tends to have a high cbd content, it checks the thc content. so your left with a focused buzz. This strain works great for people with...”"

You, my friend, are completely correct.  I have a chronic pain condition as well, and this strain was amazing.  I was able to accomplish so much while medicated, my leg felt better, had less spasms, and my mood was generally uplifted.

I strongly recommend it as well!”"

Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-thai/reviews/1410862,"“This is a very effective strain for pain relief and mood enhancement. There is a euphoric feeling that starts almost immediately and then it peaks about 1/2 hour later, combined with an overall tingling body sensation.  It is a good daytime strain but it can make you feel a bit groggy when wearing off, so beware of that. Overall a stellar strain for pain management!!”"

So, not super sativa, but will get up and active. I enjoy the mild sedation after the initial effects no longer persist. I recommend for any one looking to replace stimulants such as caffeinated coff...”"
