These chunky, frosty, emerald buds belong in a museum, but one waft of the mouth-watering key lime scent and you'll go to Nicolas Cage-ian lengths to score and protect this strain. As part of the grower's Reserve line, it comes in upscale, UV-proof glass packaging to keep its contents in pristine con...”"

Has a strong heady high which makes your head a heavy bowling ball 🎳 It does help with stress and anxiety and as time goes on it creeps and gets stronger. It has a euphoric feeling behind it all and really relaxes the body. Went in with a headache and anxiety and slowly after my dab my headache begins to diminish and my anxiety al...”"

Heavy hitting Indica from the B.K., but the lime tones it down making it very pleasurable. The taste is minty lime-ish with a bubble gum after-taste, the smell is like a McDonald's Shamrock Shake. Amazing strain for those with a high tolerance! Instant hitting body high with some euphoria.”"

*swipes right* 
For your auditory accompaniment: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv1k4Dug7_8 

This is my first time with this strain. 
Stemming from its roots in Katsu Bubba Kush (I) and Lime Skunk (S-H), Lime Sorbet is a classic, Indica with a few Sativa style bonuses! 
In this 500 mg Liquid Live Resin cart  THC = 55.20% + THCA = 8.90% Total = ...”"

Bluecollar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lime-sorbet/reviews/1588957,"“It's the taste of lime that hits you first...then a rush of adrenaline and shortly after full body comfort....If you ride out the sedation it turns into an alert full body paralysis....not a daytime strain....but not necessarily a knock out indica but very smooth..”"
Briboy71,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lime-sorbet/reviews/1568074,"“Great smoke, great flavor, Wow, A couple rips of this one and it definitely eased my pain and some of my other ailments highly recommend this Bud.

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lime-sorbet/reviews/1715153,"“Picked up some of this sauce from Cresco, the taste is absolutely unreal. Obvious lime taste paired with a sweetness like a desert.
This strains perfect for dealing with stress, and relaxing your body. 
The Lime Skunk sativa parent prevents this from being a total knock out for me.”"

The look, the smell, and the taste of Lime Sorbet budder makes this strain a treat for the senses.  Mentally, this is a very relaxing indica that isn't too sleepy; this high that I'm feeling is one marked by happiness, coziness, and introspectiveness.  If you have the chance to grab this, do yourself a favor and do so.   Enjoy!”"

Very nice and relaxing buzz. I typically like most indicas and this is no different. 

Recommend vaping/smoking this in the evening. Great for unwinding and sleep. Also a depression/stress killer. 

Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you get the chance!”"
