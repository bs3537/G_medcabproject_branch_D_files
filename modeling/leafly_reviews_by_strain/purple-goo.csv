opooka,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-goo/reviews/1355275,"“Talk about some sticky-icky! Nice full buds with fruity undertones and hints of pine. Great cerebral high accompanied by a nice relaxing body high with a mellow euphoria as the kicker. 

Would highly recommend for both pain and pleasure.”"
joshua.jakson,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-goo/reviews/1371401,"“Got this strain because I was smoking a lot of sativas to get rid of head aches and boy I proved to myself once again by doing that that I do not recommend sativas for any type of physical pain, such as head aches yes even head aches. 
SO 
The purple goo looks fibrous and dense but is actually a pretty light flower with good orange color hairs and not so crystaly. 

so the high was long and it hit you quick all m...”"
AmbitiousStoner,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-goo/reviews/1062343,"“I have smoked very many strains but Purple goo by far is the  most potent strain I have ever consumed. Purple Goo is definitely for the experienced smoker, although it is an indica it will definitely alter the mind. Great Strain!”"
NotNowKid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-goo/reviews/1370896,"“I had Purple Jah Goo so I don't know how different it is from Purple Goo. THE FLAVOR was amazing it tastes exactly like a purple jolly rancher. It is a nice thick but cool and smooth smoke. However, it isn't very strong. It is good for relaxation and it has excellent flavor but won't get you super stoned.”"
phillyday,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-goo/reviews/1062335,"“"This is by far my favorite strain! haze pushes through my tolerance level, and sometimes when I smoke it feels like I'm smoking for the first time. I can get real focused on a video game or show, and be totally involved in it. Great strain to watch nature shows with :)"”"
Sapphyy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-goo/reviews/1208775,"“If your looking to unwind and rid pain this is your strain! Purple Goo was a spontaneous buy last time I went into the dispensary and I was very pleased with my purchase! I personally prefer Sativa's but it's always nice to unwind with a nice Indica after a long day and melt into the couch! Smell, Tastes, and looks? 8/10 - High? 9/10 so overall i give it an 8.5/10. Would recommend medicinally for Insomnia, Stress, an...”"

The buzz lasts for a very long time, and is a mixture of body high and head high, almost has a bit of mushroom-like effect. Very good choice for partying and social interaction, as well as meditation and spirituality.”"

I tried late at night and all my muscles slowly started becoming hard of hearing when I told them to move. I felt tranquilized. Mind quite foggy and body felt massaged by every expert since 1AD. This is my favorite straight india now.”"

The high starts quickly-in under 2 minutes. It’s super relaxing with solid pain relief and a mild head buzz. Not spacey but certainly introspective and care free. You’ll want to snack so have munchies on hand.
This is a functional indica, ideal for a la...”"

That is my only real quirky complaint about an otherwise fine product. Upon inhalation you will experience a light to moderate warm peppery taste with an extremely light aftertaste of berry.

If you like purple kush you need to try this one! The smell and taste to this strain left a strong  berry-cheesy flavor and pine smell. The overwhelming euphoria, body tingling, numbing feeling you get is great. Pain and stress melt away with the feeling of going to bed. I would buy this again!”"
