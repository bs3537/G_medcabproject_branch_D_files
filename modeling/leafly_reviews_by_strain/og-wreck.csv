gertschy99,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-wreck/reviews/1302239,"“One of the best strains I've had in a while. Was super nauseous this morning and almost threw up and got myself to smoke a snap of this stuff and safe to say.. No longer nauseated... Body no longer has that morning soreness you can get from life's burdens. Would buy again if it was the quality I have (some of these other pictures posted look swaggy/dirty as hell. Mine was extremely sticky and dense covered with trico...”"

Killed my pain, along with any chance of thinking straight. ;-)  Luckily, I didn't have to think at all, because music was deep and layer-full, and sound was kaleidoscopic during the peak. 
 
Smell and taste is sweet, mildly skunky, almost a slight hint of bergamot. 

Caution to pain patients: UP + PAIN FREE = Chance of getting too busy puttering around- don't cause yo...”"
vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-wreck/reviews/1178435,"“This was surprisingly good given how cheap ($7) the gram was. Decent pain relief, mood and energy definitely "up" wicked munchies! Good for after work when pain is up but there are things to do.”"
subduedexcitement,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-wreck/reviews/1323567,"“Vblover16 - Yep our Thick Wicket (a cross between OG Kush and Trainwreck that we sold for years in medical) has been rebranded as OG Wreck. Sorry for the confusion. It is the exact same strain. And we are stoked that you like it! You should some of the concentrates made from that stuff. The terp profile is amazing!”"
hazey89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-wreck/reviews/1070765,"“Just picked up an 8th of this killer for $60. The buds are dark green and very frosty. Lineage is obviously OG Kush x Trainwreck. The taste is amazing and one of my favorites yet. The high is even better as the trainwreck seems to be more dominant in this batch, more of the clay face that trainwreck is known for. Overall great smoke for chilling, playing video games, movies, or even deep thought.”"

CleverJimmy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-wreck/reviews/1240249,"“VERY strong strain with an intense high. For me personally it was mostly in my head. It smells soooo strong its crazy. I had it in two baggy's inside a pocket in my backpack and I could smell the strong skunk smell from across the room. I took two hits from a bowl and couldn't stop coughing”"

But since I can't function off indicas all day I needed a hybrid that won't put me to sleep or send me screaming for the hills. This is it. Wow. Within just a few hits I felt it. It's parent Trainwreck was present for the first bit, but it mellowed quickly and I was flying high. My stress melted away and I felt happier than I have in months. The truly amazing th...”"

vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-wreck/reviews/1361226,"“Vaped 3T from a full bowl mid-afternoon, it  got me energised to finally re-cover my cat's scratching post. 3T to finish the bowl after dinner and listened to chill-out music. My hearing was heightened and could sense and feel many depths of sound. A bit of closed eye kaleidoscopes, which is always nice. So in my head that I can mostly ignore my pain.”"

casparproject,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-wreck/reviews/1255227,"“Wow. :)
Phenomenal quick onset relief.  Waves of calming warmth and pleasure.  Extremely powerful medicine when used in concentrate form (shatter).  Effective as a daytime medication, as it is more energizing than sedative.  Body buzz and floaty feelings are intense, however, so don't go into this expecting something 'mild'.  In higher doses one might experience some sensory 'trickery' and IMHO pleasurable mild hallu...”"

I have a horrible time getting to sleep and this couch locked me for a bit then gave me the munchies then off to bed I went. Slept great and woke up feeling great. I love the taste more than any other strain I’ve had. It has a pepper after taste but I put pepper on almost everything so if you don’t like pepper then don’t try this. 

Every time I find it I buy it!!!”"

kyleGHAD,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-wreck/reviews/1311150,"“Pretty sativa-dominant leaning hybrid, and proves that in its high. With that OG Kush peaking out the indica for a gentle body relaxation and the Trainwreck creating a blissful and cheerful mind, life feels good, my anxiety is at bay, and it's one of the few strains that has allowed me to be active without taking blood pressure medication 😬 Got some wax of this, beautiful consistency, low temp melt, tastes of kush a...”"

JM-Sparrow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-wreck/reviews/1326249,"“I really enjoy the way this strain makes me feel. Definitely sativa leaning. I get a lot done when I use this strain. The only problems I have with it is it leaves me with a tiny headache afterwards, and the bud is generally drier than I prefer. I don't know if that might have just been where I got it from or if it's pretty normal. Anyone with advice on that are welcome to let me know.”"

Made me think really negatively and could not be active on this at all. The pain in my body seemed to be more sensitive. Overall not a good high. Okay for just going to sleep and having sex.”"
