Hashplant Haze
=============
Brehgirl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hashplant-haze/reviews/1390575,"“this is a beautiful mix of sativa, fragrant and sweet , and beautifully sticky. The unusual taste does indeed have a bit of melon about it , which is apparently what a cantaloupe is so that explains that ... i dont think this is very high on the old thc as its a nice light uplifting creative strain so cbd is very high and the build up of tolerance is a good week at least :) beautiful strain”"

This is a good strain for my migraines.  Not too euphoric and it didn't make me slow or spacey.  But still gave me the head numb effect that I need.  It helped both the nausea component but also the headache as well.

I definitely will pick this up again”"

Smells heavenly and the particular batch I had had CRAZY orange hairs sticking out all over the place.  Really mellow head high.  A little pressure in the head, like the center of my head wants to burst through to the outside.  Not in a bad way.”"
NaturesWayMedicine,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hashplant-haze/reviews/1685387,"“Patients have been given positive feedback on Hash Haze because of its benefits to help with depression, inability to sleep, discomfort, tension and loss of appitite. It smells a lot like lavender and taste more peppery with sandalwood undertones that patients really think is pleasant.”"
KevinAidenLogan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hashplant-haze/reviews/1062831,"“This plant produces huge buds from the top to the bottom of the plant. Very few leaves to trim with this one and did I mention the HUGE dense buds which completely covers this fruity plant. I like how I'm able to function during the day and not get couch locked or too dazed with this strain. It's a very uplifting and energetic buzz. One of my favorites for smoking during the active hours of the day.”"
LotusKai,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hashplant-haze/reviews/1371841,"“I have a Hash Haze (supposedly Afghani, NL #1, and Hashplant; making it an 80/20 Indica dom hybrid according to another site. In this instance they are correct, with this being an all time favorite Indica.)
The body high is verily intense, long lasting, and sedative heavy with a fair euporhia as a side note, with very little droopiness in the eye or tires effect though it is a heavy couch locking strain. 
Oddly enoug...”"

STRWBRY,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hashplant-haze/reviews/1759114,"“Smoked this after a 1 month tolerance break and it completely destroyed me. It had a good 3 hour high that most strains I've smoked don't have. The high was so strong that it makes you paranoid but satisfied.”"

jjjallen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hashplant-haze/reviews/1159357,"“This stuff is psychedelic both in its floral quality which makes you think Grapefruit and Mango. Your mind will be all over the place but - you, you can concentrate if you feel like it.   Hz is other-worldly and reminds me of the Three Stooges in its effect.  Hey they make hash from this stuff!  Hz pairs well with Mob Boss.  Schweeeeet!  ns”"

M4RCUS20,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hashplant-haze/reviews/1378097,"“Overall, I think I like this strain. The smell is fantastic, but it is incredibly strong. This strain gives me a fairly psychedelic and trippy high. However, I get very paranoid and anxious. It's fairly easy to push those effects away though.”"
