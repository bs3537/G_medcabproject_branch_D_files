the smell in bud form is very nice, like a sweet earth smell. flavour is similar a very nice sweet/earthy toke. the high is a calming, relaxing style while remaining  more clear headed than other indicas. definelty worth a go but not worth the expensive tag - I paid 140 for 14 g. better Indicas for cheaper.”"
