Very Euphoric and Heady, with a dark chocolate musky aftertaste with every puff. It stopped my anxiety and panic attacks well and chilled my racing head and I could accomplish the days missions. My favorite feature with this lovely treat is the smell it leaves to linger in your ja...”"

I think this may be my new favorite sativa.  tastes ALMOST as good as PExpress.  There's fruit there.  light and tropical. very smooth.   almost minty or sage aftertaste.  Str8 to the head with slight full body stone.  nothing an experienced...”"

Audio_Geek,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1340261,"“Okay.  Seriously.  
This strain actually tastes like the aftertaste you get after eating SweetTarts or Rockets. 

Unbelievable flavour.  
Plus, the effects were extremely pleasant for being a sativa; no paranoia or anxiety whatsoever.  I felt super happy and relaxed.  It put me in a fantastic mood. 
No harsh burnout or anything either. 

Fantastic genetics! 

 
Highly recommended!!”"

Munin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1360797,"“I've smoked myriad strains over the last fifteen years, but this is a pretty special one.  Very unique upbeat high.  Smells and tastes somewhat of chocolate.  Has the strange habit of bypassing intensity and affecting positive emotional stimulation.  Being chronically depressed since childhood, it's rather nice having a switch that seems to invariably make me happy in the first half hour of the first toke.

loswind,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1310551,"“Vaped it. This strain definitely makes you feel energetic and happy. Unlike the hybrids and indica, this sativa seemed to increase my focus making it easier to concentrate during conversations. There wasn't much of a body high and the come down didn't leave me  sleepy, but only slightly groggy.
I'll update after I've tried it as an edible.”"
SuperHumanFREe,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1243675,"“Great sativa to smoke before the gym or something you need to get done. Earthy taste with a piney sweet smell. The high is a head high with a body high after. Great for a person with anxiety or nervousness or stress.”"
Ulysses420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1163874,"“Great Strain. Smoke 1 blunt and you'll be happy and up lifted. Smoke 2 blunts and you'll just want to sleep.”"

iconicdave,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1222585,"“I'm not a big fan of Sativa's but I must say that I was not let down by any amount, I got it for a the reason to help with the day to day and it did exactly as I hoped and expected by having the ability to cross reference reviews and lineage and the scientific footprint thing which is great to try to dial in to find the perfect bud for you. Super good bud.”"
rocker105,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1178862,"“this strain is very cerebral and straight to the dome. Sit back and wait after your first bong rip. it might be all you need to feel this strains full medicinal effects. very pretty bud and potent, the smell is that of sweet strawberry taffy”"

dooweed,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1250377,"“My friend introduced me to this strain and I can honestly say it has helped me think a little clearer and more logically. As far as taste goes, you can really hit the sweet notes if you burn long enough. The taste is smooth and soothing and it gives you almost this candied aftertaste.

It's an uppity, so if you're feeling down or you want to get up and do something; indulge yourself to this treat!”"
Anon420574,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1138308,"“don't  see the cheese or chocolate  flavors you guys are talking about. then again I'm  vaping  most of the time. it tastes like gobstoppers. at least to me and my girl. super dank dense buds very sticky and sweet. one of the better buds for my back probs (spinal fusion)”"
Dudemankidson,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1257940,"“The only of example of this strain left me far behind my own train of thought. Not good for my own critical thinking skills. Killer w a beer under the sun though. The product was very well grown & of quality regardless of my preference's.”"

cbblack27,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1736177,"“Very active head high!  Only use this strain if you have something to do, like go to the gym or run errands. It made me pace back and forth a little bit since it was so energetic.”"

indicancure,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/willy-wonka/reviews/1235209,"“Quick acting after smoke, awesome taste, earthy and herb like , makes you want to smoke another bowl  just from the those two aspects. Verbal clarity and talkative also right off the bat , and a great feeling of calm happiness with incentive to get things done . Will def be restocking this in my medicine "pantry".”"
