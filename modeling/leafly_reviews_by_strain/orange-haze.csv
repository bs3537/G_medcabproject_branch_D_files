Orange Haze
=============
Sir Kinsey III,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-haze/reviews/1394379,"“One bong rip had me good an on my ass for about two hours. This strain is very potent. It has an aroma of citrus and cat urine/ammonia. Very high odor, even in my top dresser drawer the entire second floor reeked of bud. Glass vials a must when transporting or storing. Fast acting strain, was completely stoned within a few minutes. Main effect is a serious case of the tinglies. A very pleasant experience. However, be...”"

The flavor is similar to giving a BJ to the Chillie Willie® penguin.
Imagine eating a mouthful of orange koolaide pow...”"

RoscoeWolf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-haze/reviews/1416267,"“I got a local homegrown "dro" version of Orange Haze here in Dallas and the smell was citrusy but not the normal pungency you get from Colorado weed. Anyway the weed is very very sticky and hard to grind. Easy hits and the after taste is extremely neutral.
