nickrazza,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/grape-god/reviews/1395536,"‚ÄúAll hail the mighty Grape God!
Godbud x Grapefruit. 
Not for being this crazy heavy hitter either, 
but for being the definition of a perfect indica dominant strain.
This medicine acts as both pain relief as well as an anti-anxiety very quickly. With a smoother onset over the body and legs, a calming head high gives a sense of ease making it great choice for a first time patient.
Definitely recommend checking it out!‚Äù"

I found this strain was exceedingly helpful with reflection and introspection. Therapy in a bag!

It is not overly strong, but very balanced both mind and body.

It smells like a white grape crossed with blueberry (and a hint of mint), and the smell is strong.  The smoke is light and almost has no taste.

Smell of grape is present but faint as it is overtaken by a strong earthy smell. The taste is for the most part earthy while a little hint of grape makes it a pleasant after taste. Very Euphoric initially and as it tapers off a mild stone approaches and lingers into extreme feelings of being mellow for hours after. The buds were dense while still allowing for push.‚Äù"

THCWA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/grape-god/reviews/1390815,"‚ÄúGrape God is an Indica dominant hybrid (70% Indica x 30% Sativa).  It is excellent for relieving stress and has a nice body high.  The buds are incredibly sticky, very dense, and long lasting in the bowl.  The taste is very fruity and pleasant with no bad after taste.  Everything about is is "grape"; grape taste, grape smell, and grape flavor on exhale.‚Äù"
