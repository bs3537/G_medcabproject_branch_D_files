Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-skunk/reviews/1410310,"“This hit me hard within the first 15 minutes, I only needed a little. Which was surprising compared to most of the other strains I do. I usually take about 30-40 hits in order to become fully medicated.  I tend to have the opposite effects, where a Sativa would give you Energy, it would put me to sleep. Indica's give me energy and I am able to function better than normal like a well oiled machine. It's great for pain...”"
Agent907,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-skunk/reviews/1388619,"“First got this strain from Lake Effect Dispensary in Portage,MI. Saw the THC levels were some of the highest I've seen! The buds were nice and healthy with a strong effervescent aroma. Hit me in the head fast and steady with a little bit of body tingling. Taste is delicious with a spicy, tangy favor. I can feel a little bite on the aftet taste. Definitely another discovery that has moved into option rotation when sel...”"

Took 15 to 20 minutes to fully kick, but then, game over. You're in for a solid 2-3 hour high. For fun, I'd give this one Five stars. For relief, probably 8. Didn't notice any paranoia and munchies were 6 out 10. Definitely a stay at home and do nothing weed when your give a shit is broken and your care about is gone. Lazy, lazy, laz...”"

I definitely try to save it for the end of the day or days when my pain is unbearable because of it's very strong sedation effect.

Long pine like buds that are coned at the top, nice green leafs Its color is very nice. Its kick is a slow riser for pain its a creeper for the body.

RWright,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-skunk/reviews/1373422,"“Overall nice strain.  Got at a pretty high Thc rate of 27, so I was expecting it to live up to the hype.  I have smoked a'lot of Skunk variations, but not this one.  Mine smelled like pineapple and cheese and tasted a little of the same.  Worked great for pain, anxiety, stress, appetite and insomnia.  Overall nice feeling and pretty long lasting relief.  Would buy again.”"
ButterSkotch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-skunk/reviews/1568866,"“This has quickly become one of my go to strains. For me it's all about that feeling. This hybrid had that feeling for me. It keeps my pain at bay while allowing to function with a clear focus. The smell I usually get is an earthy citrus aroma but I'm sure that will vary. I would definitely recommend this strain to the chronic pain patient looking for a strain to micro dose throughout the day.”"

Difficult to pinpoint flavors at first, but it's a soft & smooth smoke, not harsh or hot or spicy-- but inviting, tempting, compelling me for a third hit right now, and already I'm feeling it's smooth, mellow lift, both in mind and body, and both quite nicely.....”"
dsharp,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-skunk/reviews/1339953,"“This strain is great for insomnia.  I didn't get any feeling of euphoria or giddiness that I expected based on the comments from the dispensary clerk I bought it from.  After just a few hits, I fell asleep almost immediately... and I slept really deeply.  I wouldn't recommend it for relieving anxiety/stress if you don't also want to go to bed right afterwards.”"
