harris,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1229500,"“This strain was REALLY fun to smoke, a couple of my friends and I took a walk around a wooded area ripping three of four bowls. Was one of the best highs I've ever had.”"
AlmostAsian,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1214700,"“Got an ounce of this stuff in Chicago.  Fire Haze is best for adventures in the sun.  It doesn't make me as hungry as other strains do but if I start eating it is very hard to stop.  I always get really dry eyes and mouth.  Sometimes fire haze makes me and my friends paranoid but this stuff is worth it...  One of my favorite sativa strains that has made it to chicago.”"
Shiftea24,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1388876,"“Very good. Kept me focused on anything I put my mind to. Mostly a head high and a bit on the shoulders, as expected from a sativa. Overall, a good day-time strain when you want to relax and go through life.”"

ChronicTronic,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1161113,"“I broke into this bud and immediately fell in love, if it wasn't snowing outside it would be in here because these crystals are off the hook. Great high, hits you fast, great get up and go strain.”"
EdibleEm,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1310786,"“Good smoke after my nap today- got me back up and moving again. I liked the head based high- I have a tendency to clench my jaw and carry tension in my neck and this helped me stay chill for sure w/o being tired again. Didn't hit me 💥 like other people describe but I certainly got a boost after smoking it- probably a good one for a dinner party or social outing type gig. Got dry mouth almost right away so keep the H...”"

Deafdude,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1247429,"“A great daytime strain. It's a head high type of weed. Very good for people who want to stay awake and enjoy a nice mellow high.”"
redfireandree,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1157764,"“this is probally my favorite sativa strain. hits you hard and fast but the only issue is its not around enough. great for adventures or just trying to chill. euphoric is the best word I could think of”"
RaidenHawke,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1157766,"“This stuff hits you hard and fast. it's a great high for listening to music and chilling. You get pretty dry mouth and eyes but it's me and my brothers favorite strain. The only problem with it is we can't find it enough!”"
spazcore916,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1157765,"“decent head high not so much a body high or pain relief that I was told from the dispensary (a first they're usually on point). put me in an awesome mood, great strain for video games or hanging out with buddies, looking forward to my camping trip with this one. very strong smelling even in an air tight container”"
crazycolton55,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1157762,"“This weed when looked at has many red hairs covering it making it look almost not green but just a reddish orange. When broken up it is very dense and dark green on inside with little crystals, just sticky. When inhaled, is very earthy flavor and aftertaste. Great if you love haze. 4/5”"
ewanweston,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1157763,"“Quite an intense high will have you on your arse in large amounts. Makes you feel relaxed and will leave you pretty monged out. The high is quite heavy but I think its pretty good bud.”"
MaryJaneExpert,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fire-haze/reviews/1157767,"“A very nice high from this strain. A nice head high with a great body high! I smoked some of this before I laid down to watch Netflix, and man it felt great. If your looking for something to really put you to sleep this isn't it.”"
