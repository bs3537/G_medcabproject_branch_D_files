Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1342637,"“A great cross of Blue Dream productive and creative, with the added Spacey body Buzz. great afternoon video game session with friends strain. definitely happy, and not noticing usual aches and pains. similar vibe to Snoops dream”"
willwork4bud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1062667,"“Very nice flavor, in this cross between Blue Dream and  Northern Lights #5. It's sativa dominant, but yet still fairly heavy enough for nighttime use but does not promote drowsiness for the most part.

Very nice blue/purple type of smell and flavor with a buzz similar to permafrost. A good hybrid for all around use, with to me what seems to be a bit on the heavier side for a sativa which is what I prefer. In other ...”"

A reflection of themselves on a mirror. Can't stand to look at yourself
So you look to blame some one else. 
Instead of looking straight a head, you look into your abyss of your soul.

northern lights is a personal favorite of mine, this definitely takes after its parent with a fruitier, mintier flavour. 
I'd grab again! indoor or outdoor”"

HailstormsInc,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1132516,"“Gives me an intense head high but it's accompanied with a bad headache and pressure around my sinuses. Overall I'm not all that big of a fan. But hey that's just me.”"

leroybbad,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1323631,"“I'm very relaxed, nice mellow body high.  I especially appreciate how I feel my muscles just sort of melting into relaxation.  This helps a lot with my back pain in that sense (because it's musco-skeletal tension).  

The first time I smoked it and I got a bit anxious.  Just a couple solid puffs.  I generally vaporize my herb.  Vaping it, I don't feel anxious.

I have brutal cotton mouth.”"
liljaybird,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1344260,"“My favorite strain is Blue Dream so I was excited when I got the chance to smoke this! Northern Lights is a good strain too.. I just feel a little anxious when the high started but I was already high on a top indica strain for a sleep aid so that could've been the reason but by far I say the cross breed names should rate itself💨”"
jaxygyrl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1356958,"“What a unique and special strain! In some ways, this strain is more Sativa-like than many pure Sativa's because the high is so cerebral, creative, happy, sociable, talkative; and, because the corresponding body high is so minimal: No discernable sleepiness, heaviness, or inertia. I can be productive and focused if I need to be, or playful and creative (which is what I generally roll with).   This magical herb I smoke...”"

HighkerReviews,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1350389,"“Great strain. Has a relaxed, laid back feel with subtle hints of creative, cerebral sensations. Makes you happy. The high isn't very strong when it hits you. You sort of glide into it without really noticing at first. I think this is an okay strain to use before bed. Very relaxing.”"

Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1318288,"“good hybrid, but maybe not as classic as Snoops dream? Definitely got a few chuckles this time, and some energy. However, didn't get as much pain relief as last time. solid 4.5 strain. Not sure I'd be looking to pay a premium price for it. unless somehow I'm saving sea creatures by smoking it.”"
NoStop82,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1386121,"“Happy giggly fun! Talkative and uplifting. This is my current favorite. No negative effects that I can think of. Maybe a bit of dry eye but that was solved with the tears from laughter.”"

hernameisjack,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1062670,"“i purchased this looking for an easy-smoking sleep aid/pain relief. it provided both of these things without an overly intense body high, which i also appreciated. while i did wake the next morning with a headache, it is too early in my use of this strain to draw a definite link.”"
bolamb90,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1230349,"“The high was decent, the percentage is right around 26 percent. For me, this strain is a creeper. It took nearly 20 minutes after I finished a joint of this to feel it. It is definitely a strain that I would smoke again if it was given to me”"

highpriestess024,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1209710,"“Not a super big fan of this one. Like others said it gave me a killer headache and terrible red eyes. The initial 15-20 minutes gave me terrible anxiety to the point of having panic attacks. After trying it a couple more times they stopped but at first it was terrible. But I'm more prone to anxiety with certain strands, so anyone else might love it, it just wasn't me favorite.”"
jaydnt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1564644,"“Grown by Happy Hill- sooooo good. Probably my new favorite. Makes everything that feels good feel even better. Feels incredibly clear minded. A++++ strain for me.”"

cangel65,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-boy/reviews/1541437,"“WOW! What a most on usual and sensational strain, from the taste, to the next few hours.  Best Yet. 

No matter what the strain I was always left ready to sack out at the end of the high, the strain gives me so much energy and doesn’t leave me feeling tired at all. It seems like you can control your mind or let your imagination run away so we can be a wicked heavy high like a cerebral high or a highly functioning hig...”"
