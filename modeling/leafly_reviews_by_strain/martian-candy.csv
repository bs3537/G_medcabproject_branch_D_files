peacerose,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-candy/reviews/1381075,"“When I try a strain, I'm looking for relief of fibro symptoms. This is one of the best I've tried for it. A single puff or two during the daytime leaves me pretty functional with this fantastic lightness in my limbs and far less pain. Great relief from pain and fatigue. I find it easier to move, and this generally chills out my nervous system and leaves me with only a slightly fuzzy brain and a great mood.

The unusu...”"

Driving is so beautiful on the open country roads. You can focus. Pain is GONE. Daydreaming like nobodies business but still able to multitask. The realms I am getting stuck in are outta this world. So much fun in my head. But I'm able to cook dinner and bop to Steve Earle and Alabama. 
Do yourself a favor, g...”"

IntrusDave,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-candy/reviews/1329490,"“Very mellow. This is my new go-to strain for overwhelming in-law events. Relaxed me enough to deal with the 25+ people events, without any of them having a clue that I was high the entire day. 1 nice big hit every 60-90 minutes was great.

Used in PAX 3 vape. It had a nice taste to it. Earthy with a touch of sweet.

Side note - it dramatically reduced sinus infection pressure and pain for my nephew. Helped him far mo...”"

PeaceAndDank,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-candy/reviews/1553021,"“This bud is wonderful. I like to smoke a bowl before the gym, maybe after smoke a j with a friend. 3 regular smokers couldn’t get through a whole j. It’s beautiful, smells amazing, the nugs are small but they pack a punch. If I smoke too much of this before bed I wake up still high. I definitely pushed myself harder at the gym because of this, and still very social. Definitely heavy on the eyes. I’m in love.”"

Nooper,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-candy/reviews/1664118,"“This is a great strain that really stands out.  If I’ve given any strain more than three stars, then I find it to be extraordinary in some way.  The euphoria was outstanding, with all kinds of tingling and a fantastic sense of well being.  It didn’t make me sleepy, and the taste was nice as well.

Im a daily user, I like to try as many new strains as I can... but I will definitely buy this one again.”"

cbsuero,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-candy/reviews/1700254,"“This is a very relaxing strain that made my body feel tingly and warm in a matter of minutes. One thing that stood out about this strain was it's positive effects on my mood. I was pretty stressed out when I started smoking and by the time I took my third hit I was in a much more peaceful mood.”"

Jaxxology,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-candy/reviews/1706002,"“wow this strain was actually amazing. had been a while since I had such a nice Hybrid. it's quite a specific high every single time. hits in the mouth and teeth first... then it goes up to your forehead and you feel a slight oreakssure and eyesight starts going. followed by it going down to your chest. and that's when it starts hitting you like an Edible. then it extends out to your arms and they feel numb and heavy....”"

plschoosenewusername,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/martian-candy/reviews/1390355,"“Cool name, but that's about it. Copped a g of martian candy og shatter. Very unique smell and taste. Reminds me of eucalyptus. The high is just too mellow and weak for my taste. I felt focused and quite mellow but like I said the high is on the underwhelming side. No dry eyes or dry mouth tho.
Potency is meh. I don't consider my tolerance to be heavyweight at all. Good strain for beginners”"
