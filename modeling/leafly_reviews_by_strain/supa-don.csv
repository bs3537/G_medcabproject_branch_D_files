The terpenes are strong and heady.  I grew 'the don' last summer and it too is one of my favorites and very similar to the supa don.  If you are looking for something that is easy on the airways this is it....”"

Although it is Sativa dominant, I enjoy this strain in the evening to wind down. It smells great, tastes good, and always does the trick to lift my mood. Melt away a stressful day with some Supa Don!”"
