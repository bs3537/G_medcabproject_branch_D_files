=============
ajaxpjus1010,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1378871,"“Smoked in the Netherlands, this strain gave me a near instant smile. Stress seemed to leave me, and my eyes brightened with moments of pleasant excitement and occasional trippy vibes.

Pure, take 2 tokes and go from there.”"
MoldySkunk,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1378867,"“I love this strain! 
The taste is sweet and very smooth. The high is mostly a creative spacey high but easy to control. I recommend it to anyone!”"
sry4head,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1378868,"“The Strain does really taste tropical. Like a small flavour of mango and apple in the back of your mouth. Its very relaxing and very warming. Does not make you active, it does make you lazy, relaxed and very, very happy.
This Strain is worth 15 bucks in my opinion. If you get it cheaper congratz.”"
prawners,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1378870,"“I love this strain, although not typically saliva orientated, I did enjoy this very much. V.light crystally leaves mixed with dark green almost purplish leaves. Dull orange hairs and crystals cover this bud. Smells skunky and citrusy. Buds are large and snappy. Very uplifting, giggly and think I could bonk like a pornstar!”"
Kingjeshua,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1244411,"“Bought Some at The 4 Floors in Rotterdam and got really thick buds with nice looking trichomes. The high was very uplifting and relaxing.”"
matheusbh,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1378869,"“MS and Marijuana is a great combination to tropical climate changes. 
The fatigue behaviour suddenly disappears!”"
ApisFlora,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1271699,"“I bought this because I was hoping for an energetic uplifting high typical of Sativa. Sadly for me it made me lazy and tingly, it was quite strong and definitely something unique, taste is nice and complex, smells and tastes oldschool. If you have a lot of it, it definitely becomes Psychedelic... I did not have any paranoia on it.”"
adiandfriends,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1388186,"“kept me going all night,uplifting relaxing...recommended for buiginers”"
bwstone420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1313687,"“Great strain for a nice smoking session with friends. Very uplifting and nice head high. Everythings is funny after smoking this strain and you will stay very active. Smooth smoking, not a real distinctive taste.”"
fartec0,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1314750,"“From The Wall coffeeshop in Eindhoven. Very nice Sativa looking bud. Hairy. Strong smoke smell and taste. 11 eur/gr.”"
Swedensmoker,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1179896,"“Decent strain. I wouldn't really refer to it as a highgrade strain but despite of that i had a nice time smoking it. A big plus for this one was the super smooth smoke which even to this day is probably the most tasteful marijuana i've ever inhaled. You could feel the Sativa effects as it made me giggly and create and the high also lasted quite long. Good strain overall 3/5”"
julez007,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1378297,"“relaxed giggle at first then total relaxed and hungry...”"
sambadeluxe,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1256552,"“Great strain. Was not that expensive but the bang for buck ratio is great. The flavor is nice. Not harsh at all and the high is really nice. Even tough its a sativa it really makes me stoned and not at all paranoid. Really enjoying my music while slowly floating away. 8/10 would smoke again

I was going to go the zoo and me and my buddy decided that it would be funny if we smoked some weed, so we used like 0,2 gram and we were up and away it was really weird how so little weed can have such a strong effect.

Microskunk,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1634697,"“One of my least favourite strains. After about 2 pipes worth my head started to get really foggy, felt slightly light headed. The effects of Santa Maria are almost Indica like from my experience. Wasn't huge on the woody taste.”"
Emmer_NL,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/santa-maria/reviews/1762553,"“Santa Maria is a strong but easy to smoke strain. Intense flavour, and yet not too sharp. 

Santa Maria is one of my go-to strains to get high, and stay high. It doesn’t make me lazy but it isn’t very uplifting either. This is also one of the few strains that really gives me the chuckles. 

Overall: Great strain, easy to smoke

I would say worth €9,50 p/g”"
