It was quite easy to find a place that had some, thank you Colorado.  I was quite happy when I smelt the fluffy rich buds.  It wasn't like anything I have ever smelt before.

Potent with a high THC concentration, smoking this flower out of a basic glass pipe, there were two sides. On one hand, I packed a fairly large bowl, smoke daily, and this bud got me straight up blazed. My girlfriend said it made me overly sarcastic and annoying, which, in part, was due to her being completely sober. Also, the day after, many parts of my body feel infl...”"
Broncoguuid,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian/reviews/1252292,"“Greetings, 
  
First of all, the taste, it´s a little bit sweet and it has a dry-smoeky texture that lasts in the mouth for a while, 
the buds smelled like shit though. 
The hit was almost instantaneusly.
It was very fun actually, with mates a lot of jokes and laughing about deep dishs.
We were very creatives really, making up stories and shit.
Well, you know that high...

Birdpix,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian/reviews/1748507,"“Workday wonder. Nice sativa that helped give me a nice mix of happy energetic wakefulness and pain relief.
I have pretty high thc tolerance, but have to be careful with Hawaiian as it starts slowly but can pack a wallop!
Use caution as it's easy to dismiss the lightness (Hawaiian breeze) of the mental and physical sensations at lower doses. It's easy to do a few extra doses for more intense effect, but 
the line from...”"

I smoked a very small amount (under .25) and the effects lasted for a long time. This strain tastes very very sweet and possibly like pineapple.

I've only been able to get it as a concentrate and so this review is based on all of the other strains I've experienced in shatter form.
