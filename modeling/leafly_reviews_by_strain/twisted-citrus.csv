Twisted Citrus
=============
SiriusSativa,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1383612,"“This is certainly a top shelf strain, that blasted my senses with many citrus aromas with the flavor to back it up. Very energetic, yet very mellow feeling with a gentle comedown. Great for stating your day off right.”"
voice918,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1370924,"“Delicious, citrusy, straight up sativa! 

If hybrids make you fall asleep, and you're looking for a daytime strain to supplement your ADHD medication, I am 100% recommending this strain for you!
 
Clear headed and focused, but can still pack a punch if you feel like getting super baked. 

Not ideal for sleepy time, but somehow kickass for meditation. 

 Best wake n' bake strain to date!”"

punkraven,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1268856,"“Too notch, good uplifting high, a little pressure behind the eyes, but I'm super relaxed and my anxiety is "zero"”"
OCHObabies,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1278617,"“This strain is rad it smells strongly of orange.  The taste is so good too. Just very orange flavor.  I really enjoy the high. Took a trip to the beach feel happy and relaxed. I would buy more for sure”"
barnell27,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1341203,"“Twisted citrus is very fruity.  And the batch I recieved was a pleasant smoke. 👍🏻 As I grounded up the buds, the consistency of the flower was perfect and rolled up in a blunt really well! 
Aroma: A mixture of lemony citrusy orange fruits
Inhale: smoke tasted a bit earthy with sweet undertones 
This strain personally gave me cottonmouth pretty bad every time I smoked it., but not to the point to where I hate this s...”"

afropunk90,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1479360,"“Starts off a very tingly and head-heavy high, then mellows out into a relaxing buzz that's great for morning tokers. One thing that I love about this strain is that I experienced very little to no paranoia or anxiety, even when trying to push my "limits." Mixed this with "Love Potion #1" at one point and was fried out of my brains.”"

ishmale,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1287656,"“My local dispensary provided this for $30 per 10 gram 1/4 so I got an excellent deal on this. i feel like I had to smoke a lot to feel its effects, but it's definitely a decent smoke. if you can find it really cheap, it's worth a try. I found that it always helped me focus and concentrate on my own thoughts so if you're a daytime smoker this is good, but make sure to have another strain to mix it up or else you'll gr...”"
Aksmzk,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1451835,"“For someone who only smokes indicas, Twisted Citrus got me hooked. It's a nice vibe smoke and it's stinks like citrus and oranges. It's tastes better then how it smells. It's a pretty strong strain and I really recommended it. 9/10”"

Bcbud78,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1764312,"“Not normally a Sativa person but Whoa! I haven’t been this baked in awhile. All head buzz right now and can’t wait for a chill afternoon then some work lol. Good flavour and beautiful nugs.”"
sweethams,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1728451,"“I got a distillate cartridge weighing in at about 68% THC and 17% CBD. Euphoric and uplifting with a great body high.”"

KingPi,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1284507,"“Good head high. Good for the sativa crowd. Very hairy and orange. Good flavor too.”"
zacharyd3,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1442388,"“Not bad but not very potent I find, it gives you an alright high but doesn't seem to last all that long for me. I must say that the description doesn't lie, as soon as you open your grinder all you can smell is that strong almost orange peel scent.”"
OSOCV3,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/twisted-citrus/reviews/1334917,"“great”"
