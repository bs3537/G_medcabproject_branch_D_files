Palm Tree CBD
=============
yyz88,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1733181,"“Beautiful buds and great smell, but on various occasions left me very paranoid, which is strange considering it's a CBD and is marketed as a strain that's meant to make you feel calm and clear-headed. I rarely get paranoid from any type of bud so this was pretty unique and surprising.”"
DoubleRainbow2018,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1733722,"“I liked this strain a lot. This strain helped me chill out (I didn’t have any paranoia at all - mind you I was just at home), still my mind and took away any anxiety that I had. I found that I was much more patient and calm with my toddler and I was more in-the-moment and engaged... All of the daily mental chatter I normally experience was gone. 
I felt a bit physically heavy at first, but that went away rather quick...”"

In my younger years of high school I was never able to enjoy marijuana because it always wasted me. Made me too anxious and paranoid, this strain eased me in and I’ve been able to enjoy many other stronger strains. 

I still enjoy Palm Tree the most before bed, this also makes pizza pops taste like Michelin star meals.”"
OviGreen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1766473,"“If you're looking for something that will relax your mind and body without sending your thoughts to the moon, this is it. I tend to smoke slightly larger amounts of this one because it makes me feel like I'm walking on a cloud while fully able to carry out a conversation or a house chore. 

Great for stress relief, bed time, or for watching movies and wanting to feel entertained.”"
Cododojo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1766298,"“Not a particularly powerful strain, but extremely relaxing. There aren't really noticeable psychoactive effects, but offers great pain relief without insane munchies. If you're looking for something to take the edge off but not get blasted into outer space this is for you. 

The high was relaxing, I wasn't the least bit paranoid, and it was quite soothing. I find it makes me a little sleepy and is one to have for a m...”"
CannaAdvisor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1789527,"“this is my holy grail strain! like all LBS strains it smokes really smooth and packs a bigger punch than you would expect  so worth the fact that its a bit pricier than most others in my opinion. you will definitely taste more of the lemon notes when vaping and more of the earthy when smoking in a joint but its still nice and has a crisp lemon finish.  this strain is very much a mega body high vs a head high and tend...”"

The most recent batch I picked up is about 7% THC and 5.5% CBD and offers a mild, relaxing high. It is great for hanging out with some friends and chillin. Seriously you feel so calm and laid back. D O Double G in da house!! 😎”"

I don't know that I'd want it if I had anything at all to do, even just a movie might ask too much. But if you feel yourself in freefall and can't slow down, this bud right here is your parachute and soft place to land.”"
Joak,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1743384,"“A relatively light stone with heavier CBD effects. Left me feeling very relaxed and open to ideas.”"
ehams,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1744153,"“earthy tasting, not too harsh.  best vape on lower temps (200°C)  very balanced; happy and calm without being too drowsy.”"
valhallasdoor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1741720,"“Made me feel relaxed and calm. Good for my anxiety. Didn't feel too high and felt like I could still go about my day to day activities. I would recommend for daytime use.”"
J_Broadleaf,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1768149,"“(3/5) Got a gram from LBS off of the OCS site. Vaped at about 180C. Balanced and mellow head + light body high. Some tingly sensation. Could be used to relax or have a low key night in with friends.”"
Doubee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1750071,"“Excellent strain, tastes great; earthy and woody.  Isn’t too potent of a smell.  Has a very strong buzz that left me very relaxed and happy.  Helped get rid of a splitting headache.

Would recommend!”"
ladyfox37,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1797998,"“This is a fantastic relaxing strain!! Previously hated Indicas.  Often felt anxious on them. This strain made me feel so relaxed and at peace. Zero anxiety. A great way to wind down in the later evening. I felt dreamy/floaty like I had just a tiny bit of NyQuil, yet my head or face didn’t feel heavy nor did I feel any frontal pressure (with indicas this often happens to me). This is the first indica I’ve ever liked. ...”"
CarlyLou,https://www.leafly.com/indica/palm-tree-cbd/reviews/1796402,"“My absolute favourite, tried and true strain. It helps a tonne for my migraines, but is also good for a mellow, happy, feel good, light high.”"
