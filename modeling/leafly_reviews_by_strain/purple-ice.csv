It literally looks like purple ice and tastes even better, definitely best for Anxiety, Depression honestly, if you see this strain do not pass it up especially if it looks like straight "Purple Ice" it's such a dank strain. Recommended to all, I swear you'll love it! A+++++, sooooooo dank!”"
breezy_2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-ice/reviews/1382386,"“First time with the purple ice and I was highly satisfied. I took one hit and received an instant high. It was strong but not to much and lasted a ridiculous length of time even when you thought it was gone it was still there. I will definitely be coming back to this strain and encourage you to try it if you haven't.”"

LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-ice/reviews/1284392,"“Reviewed this one back in April, here to say I came across some more of this amazingness and it's better than before! All purple and orange, smells and tastes totally like purp, like grape or fruity pebbles kinda. I'd say it would be best for Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia for sure & Pain. Definitely don't pass this one up!”"

Most of the meds floating around this area are sub-par, and people even still smoke brick weed.
I am a Southern Cali. native, so I know good weed when I smoke it, I am also a heavy hitter, and this PI does the job very well.
I typically have ...”"

Very underestimated in prior review got another 1/8 and used caution this time. i am an all day every day patient and found that three hits is three to many for most patient friends one is one two many.  don't believe me try it but make sure you don't have anything to do for 3 or 4 hours.I believe its a cross in purple urkle and ice”"

Definitely a 60/40 S/I hybrid mix

When I smoked, I felt the head igh right away and then around the third hit the body mellow effect came in. Avid smoker here though so it might be a little strong for the non-average smoker.

Sweet, light skunky smell with dense almost tightly packed buds. Grinds very well and is white as ice with ints of purple color ...”"

ChubbyCheddah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-ice/reviews/1166111,"“Hard hitting sweet tasting and marvelous. This strain provides the energy to get the job done but don't over do it or you'll be spacey and giggly. True to its name, the light and dark purple hues are covered with crystals (ice).
