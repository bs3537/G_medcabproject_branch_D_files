HMdoc420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/slazerbeam/reviews/1638530,"“I want to give this strain a 4.5 I bought it from a Sweet Leaf and the buds were huge. 1/8 nugs in jar and beautiful color and smell. The smell is of some type of berries. It makes my nose tickle. The high is very nice and lasts a while. It for sure is a Sativa and is great for daytime or whenever if you want a good sativa.

Cruzazul84,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/slazerbeam/reviews/1425226,"“I'm trying what's called lazer kush but the other name is catchy. Smokes good, not harsh at all. 5 tokes is my limit for this unless I want and endless stream of thoughts and a loss of an hour or so. I find a really relaxing yet focused energy that allows me to get a lot done but still feel great.”"

At $18 an eighth from Colorado Harvest Company I WAS imptessed with the bud itself. The buds were dense as hell, light green and covered in trichomes. It broke up really well by hand and smoked fairly well, without it being too harsh. The high didn't energize me in the slightest, it was clear-headed though.
