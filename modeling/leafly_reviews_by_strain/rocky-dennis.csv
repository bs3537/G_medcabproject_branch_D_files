Smell: intoxicating, pine, chemical, fuel, lemon, with just a hint of earthy undertones.

Taste: similar to it's lovely smell, but unlike anything I've ever tried. The inhale produces an immediate smile and the exhale leaves you wanting another taste immediately.

Effects: Joy, giggles, euphoria that la...”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rocky-dennis/reviews/1482718,"“I love any strain with yummy sour rubble as a parent. This train leaves me with a smile ear to ear. 

Not sure how to feel about the name of the strain. Not sure how it relates to the strain. Does it make you so high you feel like your face is disfigured? Is this a strain that provides relief to those with craniodiaphyseal dysplasia? 

It's a really wonderful strain you'll get hooked on that taste just like I am!”"

I greatly appreciate this strain & the  energy (for me) it brings- yet I'm not hyper. Very very nice Day strain for me. I have chronic pain (catastrophic failure surgery in my cervical spine 😱) miracle I can walk 😊‼️ & I'm bl...”"

jimmyinspazzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rocky-dennis/reviews/1522532,"“This strain is phenomenal all around.  Meets all of the criteria for a perfect flower in my book.  Starting with a flavor different than any other strain I have tried before which is awesome.  Adding to that is how enjoyable that flavor is with a strange bite on the end of it.  Takes a minute to get used to seeming almost like a fluke causing immediate fascination as to what the parent strains could possibly be?

DeputyGod,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rocky-dennis/reviews/1602143,"“First, this strain hands-down has the *best* super-hero theme name. This is another favorite of mine (Bruce banner, 🍓 cough, gsc)  and has similar effects as those: great on my migraine pain with some euphoria and lots energy, leaving me feeling productive. Full body high with some fuzziness between my eyes. This is a bit stronger and long lasting than the above listed. Use accordingly and enjoy.”"
Azboom41,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rocky-dennis/reviews/1495241,"“Best strain I have smoked in a good long while. Made me happy and gave me a vibe I haven't felt since I first started smoking. 10/10 would recommend for every person to try.”"

budsimple,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rocky-dennis/reviews/1583580,"“The smell!  I love the smell.  I had a strain called Incredible Hulk several years ago and it had almost the same order.  I want to identify the name is the sent.  Anyone?

As as far as the effect I can confirm that this strain (for me) gives me an energy lift.  I was smoking WiFi (a white widow cross) and Mother's Helper.  WiFi (for me) was kinda of middle of the road, meaning it wasn't that much of a shift for me. ...”"

MrSlfDestruct,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rocky-dennis/reviews/1646829,"“Probably my favorite hybrid right now. The flowers were nice, dense nugs that produced that classic sour smell when broken open. It was so sticky that I had to pass on the grinder and break it up by hand... first world problems lol”"

theORherb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rocky-dennis/reviews/1574325,"“Rocky Dennis is a really nice hybrid, that has strong sativa qualities. I am curious about the name, what's the connection to the strain? It has an interesting smell, that's kind of herbal and earthy with a bit of pepper. The smoke is smooth, and didn't make me cough. It gives a nice head-high, that really helps melt the stress of the day away. I got it for an awesome price at Magic Castle in SW PDX! I'd get it again...”"
whitefireOGmesa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rocky-dennis/reviews/1598320,"“Really great head high, my only complaint is it tastes a little  like an unknown chemical. The high only last about 1.5 hours. Helps with my back pain too.”"
