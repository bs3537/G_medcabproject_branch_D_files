bradt627,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1373570,"“Friends get amazing buds :) NY needs  to legalize seriously because this whole country is going down economically and marijuana will stimulate the economy if the government can place a simple tax or levy on marijuana. On the other hand, this strain was AMAZING.

I am lucky to get this where I am from. Honestly I was instantly uplifted just seconds after inhale. Very strong, pungent order in and out of grinder. Awes...”"
GeekStoner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1351385,"“I'm giving Crippler a 5 as a strong surprising sativa  hybrid. The first thing I noticed about this strain is the berry fruity smell. The smoke wasn't harsh for me so I smoked a bit more than needed for my  medical reasons , it is helpful with body pain however too much gave me a headache but that is common for me with sativa. For pain relief it's wonderful , it's a great day time strain if you don't over do it othe...”"
KorriVi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1351384,"“This was a strain I bought more for the name than anything. Hippie crippler * love that ! Anyway the effects were solid, I liked the Relaxed/chill high, with (at least for me) good general pain relief.”"
AlexDavis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1351380,"“I received an ounce of Hippie Crippler from a close friend about 2 weeks ago. This strain was good overall; nothing unbelievable. The buds were small to medium and dry/crispy. The trichome production was moderate; up close and in good lighting every crack and corner was white with crystals. The buds were very sticky..mainly light green with a little orange/brown hairs. The smell was stronger when the buds were broken...”"
vegetablemed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1351383,"“The flowers overall were a very nice light green. Very dry and light herb broke apart easily. Smooth smoke that had some nice skunk ak-47 influence and fruity blue satellite hints.”"
BLAZINrightNOW,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1343594,"“Happy smoke... The pheno I tried was leaning towards the AK in bud structure and high. Very productive strain without the paranoia I find in most sativa dom hybrids. I have been interested to try it ever since reading the name! Hippie crippler did not disappoint 😎”"
joshyd94,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1351382,"“Delicious, uplifting, get-stoned-and-take-a-hike kind of bud. Top notch!”"
soraw,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1351381,"“My friend bought this weed from a small time grower. The bud looks dark green with some brown hairs on it. The smell is very strong. The taste is sweet and earthy just like its smell. I got that burnt caramel flavor which i really like. Overall the experience is very uplifting and happy. We had one gravity bong hit and follow by a fat blunt. It came on slowly at first. But got us pretty high at the  end.”"
GothicLucien,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1604702,"“Very medicinal strain how ever Leafly has the genetics wrong True Hippie Crippler is Blue Dream x Ak47 x Green Crack”"

I've tried Cannalope Haze and Green Crack, but Hippie Crippler is the best strain that  actually makes me feel energetic. With depression, I suffer from intense lethargy and chronic fatigue. Hippie Crippler got me feeling good AND having no problem getting tasks done (even got me to exercise) with that b...”"
diplyo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1205129,"“I get a different high from this every time. Once I was contemplating my life, once I was super spacy and out of it, once I was laughing a shit ton. Overall a good strain though. Makes you talkative, at least in the beginning.”"
Dratic55,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1350646,"“I'm experiencing a wonderful head high and taking from it a very sweet pine taste. It's not the most potent, but it's very enjoyable. It's making a very tingly sensation and after a while, instant hunger. I'm relaxed and feel quite euphoric. 
Enjoyed myself ^^”"
twonouns,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1386949,"“At first the smell is somewhat unappealing with a scent of cheese or puke, but the taste while smoking is definitely not the case. The high is great for early in the morning or getting work done, but is strong enough to make you feel giggly happy and very relaxed.”"
Aaron420FtM,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1343596,"“Really enjoyed this strain. Very good for sleep if you've got insomnia!”"
Herbalmagician,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1286448,"“This is the best strain for a sour mood. Sunshine in a bag. I smoked this while feeling really down, and it totally turned my mood around. It also has a very unique sweet/piney flavor - almost incense-like, very not weedy at all. It's pretty clear headed too, even at ~22% thc. Very smooth, I didn't cough much until the very end of my .75g joint. I would get this again to use for my depression, but I generally prefer ...”"

EdwardEnigma,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hippie-crippler/reviews/1305112,"“I set the fire alarm ringtone as my alarm. Passed out after a joint. Woke up 20 minutes later to my alarm going off. Ran into kitchen and opened the oven. I started tweaking thinking that the "smoke police" where going to come banging like "hey it smells like a whole lot of kush out here !!!"--I realized that I was faded and it was my phone the one time. All in  5 seconds. Thank you Hippie Crippler.”"
