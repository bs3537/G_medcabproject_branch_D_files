Not good when  harvested too early! Need to Watch the trichones carefully with this strain. It makes it or breaks it! It either tastes clean and light, a sweet lemony flavor or bad like cat piss. It does motivate you to do things. Feel more focused, creative and not that hungry. The buds are light green in col...”"

StonerOfValor,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-sativa/reviews/1373428,"“For what this strain is set out to do, which is provide you with a focused clean high, this absolutely excels. This is truly a medical sativa, that is potent but not overbearing. Definitely will recommend this one to every toker, but especially to people who have depression, physical/mental pain, or negative thoughts”"

Villegas,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-sativa/reviews/1150863,"“This is such a wonderful sativa. 
It has all the properties of an indica high, but without the extreme sedative effects that indicas carry.”"
SamSimnitt,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-sativa/reviews/1066527,"“Not very powerful. Gives a weird high, very slight body and very slight euphoria but kicks in some focus. Good daytime high for kicking back with video games or long boring projects”"

Smell: Smells kinda like lemons?
Taste: You get some lemon on the exhale.
High: Okay the important stuff now. I smoked a joint of this at about 9 pm, and watched a movie. I could tell I was kind of baked, but this Sativa provided more of a clear headed, deep thinking high with no body ston...”"

macprincess,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-sativa/reviews/1290688,"“4.5 - smells so lemony! Fantastic smell, look. Light flavor. Little goes a long way. I suffer with bad anxiety so pure sativas are not usually for me. This was too pretty to pass up. In small quantities this is very uplifting and happy. Makes me feel like doing things. Can't go overboard tho or I get shakey. That is all sativas with me.”"

Crazy rush at the beginning which drops you into a couch-lock hole for about 45 minutes.

Definitely something that needs taming. I didn't rate it out just merely because *I* didn't like it, not to my taste but someone out there will love it especially if you like the monginess.

Cotton mouth was intense.”"
