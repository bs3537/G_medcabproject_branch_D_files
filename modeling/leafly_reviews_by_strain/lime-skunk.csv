BestReviewerEver,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lime-skunk/reviews/1410675,"“Terpapalooza! Definitely one of the loudest, most flavorful strains I've come across. Its high transitions smoothly from an energetic rush to senses of spaciness and relaxation. It's definitely a sativa dominant strain, but could even be smoked early in the evening due to the dynamic nature of its effects”"
Yajairajade,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lime-skunk/reviews/1384484,"“The buds are beautiful frosted in trichomes, the color was of lime green, and rustic pistils, when squeezed the bud bounced right back it had a resinous feel. It's an AMAZING strain smells earthy, limey and of skunk. The terpenes in this strain are Alpha - Pinene, Beta - Pinene, Beta - Myrcene, D - Limonene, Ocimene, Terpinolene, Linalool, Beta - Caryophyllene, Alpha - Humulene. I

ChiTownConnoisseur,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lime-skunk/reviews/1346145,"“Nice flavor/smell, it really lives up to the namesake. Buds are dense and frosty, experience is middle of the road Sativa; not too racey but certainly uplifting.”"
Robin312,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lime-skunk/reviews/1410676,"“Smells amazing! Fruity tasting. Reminds me of fresh squeezed lemonade. I use this when I have an active day. It keeps me motivated but isn't to speedy.”"

Set goals beforehand, you will achieve them.

A slow and steady - yet subtle onset of benefits when vaping some wax crumbles of this strain.  Lime Skunk, not to be confused with Lime Green Skunk, is a good Sativa to have on hand.

As far as the viscosity of the sugar, i note that this batch is closer to a sauce type wet sugar.  Think wet sugar and that's exactly what we have.
