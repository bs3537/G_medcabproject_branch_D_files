White Slipper
=============
TerrapinCareStation,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-slipper/reviews/1360029,"“A true sativa powerhouse! White Slipper has a very quick onset, with a heady high that will last for quite some time. The White Slipper is great for doing arts and crafts, going for hikes, or to have an introspective moment. The White Slipper is our Glass Slipper (Pineapple X Cindy 99) crossed with the White, creating a potent cerebral medicinal affect. With a sweet flavor and aroma, White Slipper also tastes and sme...”"

Mjolnir23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-slipper/reviews/1360028,"“Purchased this strain from Terrapin Care Station in Boulder, CO. The buds have large kona and a frosty, bright green appearance. Very strong smell. Absolutely wonderful strain. After 4 hits, I forget I was smoking and instead get lost in some spontaneous creative moment. Fast acting, long lasting high. Definitely recommend if you are in the mood for a powerful Sativa!

THC content not definite so don't quote me.”"
GreenPie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-slipper/reviews/1375662,"“Great for video games and music. Pretty euphoric for sure, almost psychedelic. Has a crash though it isn't a bad one. It just makes me kind of tired later on which is useful if timed right, for using that tiredness to then sleep.  

I also use this to work out. I had an accident so I have to do physical therapy exercises daily. With this and some music I get really amped-up and it definitely distances the mind from a...”"

Get you some.”"
ChiefGarrettonjua,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-slipper/reviews/1375664,"“Amazing strain to say the least. If you ask me, this strain is best used when doing outdoor activities. In my case, this is the preferred strain for any type of rock climbing.”"

Kosmic_Karma,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-slipper/reviews/1375665,"“well this is the first saliva dominate strain we have tried before. To start it tasted like lemon or citrus almost. The affects are very happy and giggly, we watched funny YouTube videos for an hour and a half. we was talkative and I give this strain a 5 star over all.”"

misssamanthakara,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-slipper/reviews/1347315,"“All around smooth and happy high. Remained calm yet upbeat in conversation. 100% would recommend smoking before seeing your  grandparents - I had the best time with mine!”"
hintofscent,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-slipper/reviews/1288117,"“This strain is definitely more sativa dominant! great for people with anxiety 👌🏼”"
rmxxps,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-slipper/reviews/1767749,"“Uneventful is the way I'd describe it. It's fine, not a total waste but the high was short lived. It was a mid grade high feeling that slowly bring you to relax but aware mood. Flavor profile was not very strong and bit of a spicy note but nothing to make it stand out

Nothing exciting compared to many other strains. I probably wouldn't turn it down but would not buy again.”"
SusanMurin18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-slipper/reviews/1723095,"“Great sativa dominant hybrid. Great daytime strain. Helps with pain and depression.”"
Kkakes33,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-slipper/reviews/1785442,"“Saw this on the menu from Terrapin Care Station PA. My eighth was tested at 25% THC. The aroma of the flower is mouthwatering - a little fuel, some berry, and pepper. Taste is the same but less of the berries. The effects are fast and strong. It’s a great way to start the day when I need an uplifting and head-y boost to get my crippled ass out of bed. 

Also for everyone on here saying it isn’t all that in PA...you p...”"

Smokey_McPot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-slipper/reviews/1315076,"“This is an extremely Sativa-feeling hybrid.  The onset of the high is slower than other strains I've encountered, but sets in quite nicely with a euphoric, happy high - I felt like dancing and cuddling at the same time.  Great recreational strain, but didn't do as much for my back pain as Lemon G or Blueberry.  The flavor is nothing remarkable to me, but it does smoke remarkably smooth.  Very pungent after grinding, ...”"
