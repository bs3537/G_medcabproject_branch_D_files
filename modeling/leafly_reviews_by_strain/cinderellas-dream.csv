Cinderella's
=============
doobwalker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderellas-dream/reviews/1415822,"“"I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream..."

I almost missed attending the ball with this pretty hybrid princess.  
She's not the Disney sort, though- this girl slides up to you with a knowing twinkle in her eye and a sly grin on her face.  
You know the look- 
You want her and she knows you do... but she's going to tease you a bit with her golden locks and her emerald eyes.  But then, before you realize it,...”"
IandI,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderellas-dream/reviews/1381703,"“LOVE THIS STRAIN! I am a fan of both Cinex and Blue Dream, so when this hybrid came along, I was excited to try it. Sometimes, when two great strains are crossed, the new hybrid ends up being homogenized with the best standout qualities watered down. Not the case with Cinderella's Dream. It certainly heightens the cerebral sociable qualities of Cinex with the wonderful body high and pain relieving qualities of Blue D...”"
Void23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderellas-dream/reviews/1377876,"“I smoked this strain for the first time tonight. I am currently stoned and am very intrigued by the swiping motion of my phone's swipe texting.

The strain smelled like orange rinds and had a very soft feeling to it. When I smoked it, the smoke felt very soft; not at all harsh. It tasted very sweet and light, too.

The effects were near immediate, and it felt amazing. My chronic back pain didn't lessen or get worse, ...”"

Seattlehazed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderellas-dream/reviews/1368951,"“Happiest Strain Ever! Really uplifting for the mood. Definitely  daytime strain, I recommend walking with this one. Scent is heavenly - very citrusy sweet without being too sour.”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderellas-dream/reviews/1416660,"“Cinderella's Dream is a very happy high. It's like Blue Dream with a shot of espresso. 🍵☀ The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I think there are similar strains that do what Cindy's Dream does, only better.  Dirty Girl is more uppy and tastes better, and Mean Misty is more clear headed, which means I'll always grab one of those over Cindy's Dream. That said, you will not be disappointed if you give this...”"

Very energetic but not overwhelming. I haven't been able to leave my bed for the past week really because of all of the health issues that I listed above, I vaped this strain and I rode my bicycle, got my guitar out, and had an awesome afternoon instead of spending my day in bed, in a mental f***ing hell. Thanks Cindy...”"

Blue Dream was my favorite strain for years and is a parent of Cindy's Dream, which is why I love it. Similar, but better effects.”"

Thoughts have left my brain for good~
This is contentment. 

Sativa but chill
Love that full on power high~
It lacks in flavor.”"
timmysauce,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderellas-dream/reviews/1310443,"“I wrote a review last night but feel I should revise my thoughts... this strain I received is strong. Good right?! Well it's an extreme heady-high. Almost too much. I didn't find as much balance as I expected. Leafly describes the effects as cerebral stimulation. Pretty accurate but I found that said effect to be more debilitating than invigorating. I found myself locked in place after smoking.”"

Pez713,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderellas-dream/reviews/1167724,"“Not long after the first hit there is a subtle uplifting feeling, almost tingly. This feeling can stay and build with more hits but never becomes intense or overpowering. Thinking is still surprisingly clear and it gave me a desire for creativity and adventure, making this a perfect daytime high. Would especially recommend for new smokers.”"

Really spacey head high comes on fast and provides enough of a boost to go and get stuff done. In the evening, same head high but relaxed afterwards. Earthy but not overly potent smell. It tastes like good weed should.

As for pain, it doesn't quite silence it, but, like Jack Herer, it takes my mind off of it for a while.”"
