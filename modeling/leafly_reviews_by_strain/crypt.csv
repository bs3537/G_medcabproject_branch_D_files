upnfucked,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crypt/reviews/1379776,"“Great indica dominate strain. Strong and very effect for stress and sleep. Be careful to make sure you have a drink when you toke on some crypt cause the dry mouth is pretty intense but it's worth it for the high it gives.”"

Aesthetics: The Crypt I picked up has very nice bud structure... not too dense but also not too loose and fluffy--right in between. It almost looks like it has a slight white fuzz covering it at first glance. Closer examination shows that it's just the tightly packed trichomes.

LiftedYoga,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crypt/reviews/1395261,"“This is the first strain I have tried so far that has actually eased pain. I've tried many strains and read many reviews where people find relief  with a particular strain but never have experienced it first hand until last night.

icewolf27,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crypt/reviews/1222631,"“This strain is a solid 4 stars. Really relaxing loose. Thoughts are very free. Indica affects dominate the sativa affects 15-20 minutes into high.”"
ClaimCollector,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crypt/reviews/1225125,"“Pretty good hybrid. A lot more of a mellow high as I don't get energetic like a sativa but I also am not couch-locked..
