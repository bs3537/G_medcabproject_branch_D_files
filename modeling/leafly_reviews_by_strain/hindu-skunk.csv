giumarra1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-skunk/reviews/1416384,"“Find this a good strain. Good pain relief and strong feeling of arousal. Also found strain to have a mellow flavor, unlike its mother strains. 
 I find this strain is good for: Pain relief, anxiety, Intimacy issues 
 I found the following bad effects of this strain to be:  Dry mouth and eyes.

Overall I find the strain's positive effects to outweigh the negative effects. Mild taste and smell (as marijuana goes) ...”"
GhostOfJack,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-skunk/reviews/1416385,"“One of my top 10.  this strain can cut through an OG Kush high and send you up another 2 notches without added paranoia which is a testament to its strength and quality.  it lacks a little in the taste department but thats it.  4.5 which rounds to 5 stars”"

HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-skunk/reviews/1346566,"“Man oh man oh man....I grabbed some of this at a low price, so I expected some bunk. I'm glad I grabbed as much as I did, because this is some of the best MMJ I've had in a while. I smoke frequently throughout the day and my optimism peaks every time I do. The flavor is dynamic and full, and as I stated previously, the effects are second to none. One of my new favorites.”"
HighFunctional,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-skunk/reviews/1357699,"“The smell when cut-up is a musky ammonia dankness. Nice moderate citrus taste, with notes of lemon candy and menthol.
