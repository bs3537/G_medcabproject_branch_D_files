DonkeyMeat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1383239,"“Personally one of my favorite strains, picked it up from a local dispensary, earlier in 2016, I feel it leans more to a indica feel. I personally recommend this strain more then any og's or blue dream.”"
StonerStig,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1371571,"“HANDS DOWN TOP 10 DANKEST STRAINS. I picked up a quad from cookies sf, i could only smoke like half a blunt because it got me so damn baked (usally i need 2 fat ones), anyways this strain is definitely a winner, so healthy and so much flavor”"
Kalaise,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1413818,"“One of the fastest hitting strains I've ever had. within the first 2 minutes you are hit with an suicide inducing(not really) amount of euphoria. (assuming because of the GSC side) Depression/Stress immediately vanishes soon met with total clarity of the mind and you can really get lost into music haha. It is unfortunately met with a Viscous headache at some point so that's the only reason it's left at 4 stars. sligh...”"
ICouldntThinkOfAUserNameBecauseIGotHigh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1375632,"“This strain is SO good it's SCARY.

Nightmare Cookies is definitely one of my favorite flowers that seems to balance the perfect effects of good Sativa and good Indica.    W/ a creative, uplifting and calming high.

I'm not too big a Girl Scout Cookie fan but I'm an avid fan of The White/White Widow and adore this.

DO NOT pass this strain up!   Or the Boogeyman will get you!”"
JerrySprunger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1378610,"“Very clear headed uplifting and body sedating as for the high effects. The beautiful purple hues and density of the nugs is what took me from the hello. Since we cannot open jars in a rec shop the look is all you got to go off of and this one did not disappoint. Unique smell I keep putting my nostrils to the jar to write a review and I just get lost in eupboria lol. This particular bud I got from Skord, a Washington ...”"

lemondude13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1357560,"“A uniquely heady sativa dominant hybrid. Brings the cookie euphoria and mood elevation along with a trippy, cerebral head space. I felt on the verge of a mystical experience after smoking a considerably small dosage of flower. The taste and aroma comes entirely from the gsc parent while the effects come straight out of an Isaac Asimov novel. One of those varieties you've got to try personaly to understand what I mean...”"
anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1371567,"“This was a beautiful budded strain, tasty, as well as a head pleaser. I have migraines and anxiety and this made me happy and feel physically mellowed. Definitely recommended!”"
inandyo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1413821,"“Just tried this strain for the first time.  Buds were tight and heavy with kief.  I found this very smooth smoking with a nice full body high.  Although very powerful it leaves a enhanced mental clarity as opposed to the proverbial couch lock.  I would exercise, go out for the evening or simply spend a relaxing time at home on this strain.  I highly (no pun) recommend Nightmare Cookies.”"
RaiderRod,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1371569,"“It's a Nightmare for shore.  Fruity pebbles tasting, sedation avenue.  My new fav.”"
laboratory,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1371565,"“Picked up an eighth of this based on the name alone. It is one of the best times I've had while under the influence recently. Would and will pick up again. Awesome strain.”"
GirlLovesBuds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1685068,"“After spending a day fighting the crippling disappointments of adulthood, such as remembering that it was Wednesday instead of Thursday, I found myself feeling depressed and anxious. I decided to take out my new Nightmare Cookies cartridge and I have to say that I feel really relaxed and at peace with the world. Bring it on Thursday!”"
RiptideRoxa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1396182,"“An excellent sativa dominant hybrid from Skord out of Battleground, WA.  This strain features super dense nugs that are frosty and golden with undeniable hints of purple.  A great head high, I wouldn't recommend for smoking if you need to pretend to be sober, there's no faking the stoniness of this bowl.  For true Sativa lovers, I have heard feedback about this strain being a little "heavy", but for lovers of hybrids...”"
Maynard75,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1587654,"“My body and mind are pretty picky as I often get body aches/anxiety/paranoia from most strains, but after this strain found me a few months ago I couldn’t be more pleased.

No body aches nor anxiety (social or otherwise) and it’s a nicely creative strain as well.  One hit puts you in a sweet, but social, spot and a few hits locks you on the couch for some serious music listening or Netflix chillin’.

My favorite by a...”"
Katavro,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1392185,"“One of the best strains I've ever had, Very good head high for me personally, got me back in to what used to be my favorite hobbies back in my teens and early 20's which are drawing and sculpting, I've stopped doing both for a very long period of time due to lack of inspiration and motivation, now in my late 20's and this strain definitely got me back in to doing and enjoying those things even when I'm sober.”"

daisydahmer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1340059,"“Good strain, feel happy and awake. Would recommend highly :) Had purple hues with orange hairs and ground up pretty lightly though there wasn't many stems. Note to self: try more "cookie" strains!”"
Blaizze050687,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1447087,"“This is definitely one of my top go to's from now on. This strain has an awesome very heady high for a hybrid, but with just enough indica to mellow it out and relax you stress away. Very uplifting,and creativity inducing, use this for work! The buds themselves were a gorgeous frosty white, with orange hairs surrounding the deeper green buds.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone that happens to find some. Enjoy!”"
Josekilla,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1350255,"“Beautiful purple colors. Pungent Citrus smell with hints of berry. Very smooth smoke with a couch lock feeling. A good daytime bud to smoke that will keep you focused on any activity.”"

surfertoes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1587535,"“I read the reviews about it doing wonders the morning after. i smoked it before bed and originally didn’t like it. I took a break from it, then did some bong rips before bed and it was so relaxing. I definitely felt energized the next morning, yet still relaxed. It’s really nice in the daytime before doing something that you want to be over quickly- it helps pass the time.  great body buzz and tranquil mind high.”"

pnw_mermaid86,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1731444,"“One of my all time favorite cookie strains! It’s fairly pungent and reminds me of sweet sticky tree sap and pine cones.

stonerserpent17,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nightmare-cookies/reviews/1763237,"“This is an expensive strain at pisos dispensary, and totally worth it! The flavor and the high both satisfy whatever you were looking for in a functional indica. Surprising the blend is an indica leaning hybrid. All in all a great strain grown by Pepperlane of Las Vegas, Nevada.”"

Picked up a cut and she is a real keeper, total resin coverage, smells sweet, cheesy, and undertones of fruit. Yields above average, but nothing super heavy. High is mellow, GREAT FOR ANXIETY. I will grow this for years!”"
