As a patient of severe and debilitating pain most of my life,  this strain is wonderful. It helps with fibro, nerve and bone pain, sleep, and everything in between. I was able to get this medicine at my local dispensary ONCE. And it went fast, so it must have been grown and handled correctly. If you find some and it doesnt give you the relief I d...”"
ChillPill,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dark-star/reviews/1397166,"“Dark Star is an amazing CBD-heavy Indica with amazing painkilling properties (IMO very close to those of codeine-syrup) and an amazing sensation of relaxation and cerebral peace. I've had both of this strain's parents (Mazar-I-Sharif and Purple Kush) and they're also both amazing Indicas with strong relaxation effects too. Unlike it's parents, Dark Star also contains more CBD-to-THC and thus is a better painkiller (q...”"

Heavy, heavy indica. Only one I've found that will reliably put me down and put me OUT. Taste is... alright, it tastes like shit.

Stonedintellectual,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dark-star/reviews/1397165,"“This strain smells like lime and pine trees, so it's very refreshing.

This strain makes it much easier to focus, and it's almost psychoactive since it makes everything appear more HD. Be warned though: Have munchies readily avail...”"
Swede,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dark-star/reviews/1377992,"“Great strain for pain and muscle spasm! I really like this strain, with in a few minutes pain was gone and a space feeling comes over you. For me this is an evening pain relief. It also mellows you out. I recommend trying this strain if it's in your area. The spacey feeling reminds me of Mars Og with the body feeling like Purple Kush, Great combo!”"

FrogFish27,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dark-star/reviews/1220164,"“Hella mellow strain.  I love the build up to this even high, and enjoy multiple bong rips to keep the high going.  Great for getting close to bed time, and a perfect night sleep with a refreshed feeling in the morning.  I will defiantly buy a few more grams of this one.  The bud tender at Ganja Goddess delivered on this recommendation.  Thanks Aaron!”"

CuttyStarks86,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dark-star/reviews/1336589,"“Epic Indica. Delivers a strong couch lock and good for pain relief. not a strong odor or taste but reminds of a classic. Covered in trichomes and very impressive. medium yield but worth it. made some Co2 shatter rods which got featured in Dope Magazine's December 2015 issue and I must say, it rates it. may be my current favorite Indica”"
