If the sole sensation of “couch lock” was created into a strain of cannabis, this would be it. It smells beautiful. Honestly one of the best smelling strains I’ve ever had. Gave me the munchies OD. So good on the body. I’m so tired, I can’t wait to take this nap. 5/5. A hitter.”"

The flavor isn’t very noticeable to me but it numbs my body and has quieting psychoactive effects. It’s couch glue for sure”"
