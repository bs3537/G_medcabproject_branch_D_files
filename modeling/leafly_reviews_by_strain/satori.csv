JotiBoy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1394354,"“Last year I bought some Satori from canadaflag and I fell in love with this strain. I remember reading High Times and it said that Satori is a strain that brings on feelings of bliss. It really does this. The high is clear, powerful, and blissful. I feel energetic. I feel like I have to start 10 tasks at the same time. I love Satori. Mandal Seeds really nailed this!”"
Smokinat420bud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1394355,"“I grew 10 seeds 9 popped 
7 were female  
1 inside 6 outside 
this strain seems a little unstable I had one only grow 2 feet tall only had about 10 grams
one was over 7 feet tall full of Trichromes with a Hugh yield couple pounds 
the others were about 5 to 6 feet but didn't look or taste as good as the taller one with much smaller buds 
and they smells almost like a skunk pooped in a baby diaper but has a Fruit Jell...”"

barrano247,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1394353,"“Possibly my favorite strain ever. I smoked it about a month ago but if i can remember, it pretty much disables you mentally. I remember my friend an I went to target after smoking this (cant recommend driving high off this stuff), we barely made it through because every 5 seconds we would burst out laughing for no reason. Great high, long lasting, somewhat clearheaded and very uplifting, PERFECT for a sativa fan it h...”"
NorskRasta,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1394359,"“I picked up a quad worth not too long ago, and all I can say is that this is by far one of the best strains I have ever smoked. Smoked it out of a double-chamber bubbler, and after one hit, I was high. It has a very distinct and clean taste to it. When picked up fresh, it will be abnormally fluffy and smell delicious. I cannot think of anything negative with this strain other than you get red eyes and sometimes reall...”"
NuteGreenwitch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1394357,"“I don't understand what a previous reviewer stated about this causing limp d*ck.  For me, what makes Satori so special to remember is the feeling of oneness with everything.  Satori brought a unique flavor to the pipe, burned well but a little gooey from the resin, was easy to gauge when you had enough, and might I add... could create a lover out of a spent napkin!  This weed will go down in the history of weeds that...”"
DoctorFrost,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1394358,"“Been growing Mandalas' Satori for about three years now. Overall excellent growth(slow to bolt). Packs major size last half of flower. Low strength nutrient is all she wants(saves your pocket). So oily at the end of cycle - looks like diamonds reflecting. 
*As for the smoke: if you can finish a bowl of this yourself - bravo. It's CLEARLY cerebral - felt from the shoulders up. Take caution if you find some grown prope...”"

Hanz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1394360,"“Great strain to grow and one of my favorites to smoke.  Choose mothers carefully when growing from seed.  The taller, more sativa pheno's are what you're looking for.  A few tokes and stress/anxiety melts away.”"
headfullofclouds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1394365,"“The batch I got was pretty decent for the price. A bit dopey and hazy. It was good for a while to switch it up to this. But got pretty bored with it on it's own for regular medicine. Nice for a change or a relaxing afternoon but not for all the time. Maybe I need to try another stronger batch? Reminded me of Skunk or Cheese a bit but lighter and more spacey.”"
softjay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1394367,"“Smoke this and be a social butterfly. It's a head high without the pesky cloudiness of head highs. Creative, functional and witty.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1477111,"“I had been wanting this strain for a long time so I had built so much hype before trying it & I was let down. I got Satori half gram shatter by Firebrand, it doesn't do anything for me. Some other reviewers commented on the lack of buzz Satori has.
I did not experience this blissful feeling people kept describing, if anything I felt sad I've been after this strain for almost a year & it barely took care of my nausea....”"
TrailHealthClub,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1394362,"“Hands down the most powerful up and clear thinking strain I have ever experienced.  In terms of a Sativa dominant strain this is the one that is worth waiting for. With a bloom cycle that is finished and not done after 11 weeks this heat tolerant plant is the one to grow in the outside heat zone of the bulb. This strain can take the heat. This is a true connoisseurs delight and the most creative high energy buzz ever...”"
billywitchdoctor42,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1378803,"“Love this strain. Great for day or night. Daytime use I felt happy, relaxed and focused with a clear head and nice body buzz. Night time use is good to unwind, watch a funny movie and sleep like a baby. Works well for mild-moderate pain. Had a stiff neck, loosened me right up.”"
Soapy86,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1394363,"“I love this strain. Great potency. The taste is awesome. The aroma is pungent, sweet, and fruity with a hint of citrus. The high is definitely a creeper but that doesn't really detract from the experience in my opinion. It's sociable and functional, energetic and creative with a slight body effect. Definitely a great daytime smoke. The duration typically lasts 3-4 hours.”"

babaChiT,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1468558,"“this strain came my way almost 10 years ago, and I still remember its name, Satori ... beautiful buds, and WOWZAS, the buZZ. The stuff would get me doing push-ups and working out. It's been so long, but man, smoking that herb made me get off my 22 yr old ass and hit the gym. Truly awesome stuff”"
JboneAK,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1258867,"“The Satori i had was visually very sativa, even leaning more towards a *larfy* appearance. It had dense coat of trichomes that left a fine dust along the walls of my grinder. It's aroma was very sweet and seemed specifically honey like to me.

It was a bit difficult to burn. It was like trying to burn a log with a match, and this is with it ground up. The initial effect is unremarkable. It took a few minutes for it t...”"

jensexton,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1391222,"“It was kinda frosty but had a bunch of fan leaves and didn't taste great. Not a bad strain by any means but I won't pick it up again.”"
ArsonMontoya,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1271587,"“So far I find this to be a wonderful strain. I tried it today while feeling balanced but needing a little pick me up mid day, it left me feeling euphoric, and relaxed.”"
Aarghmac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1063863,"“Nice call on Greenlink's part to recommend this hybrid. I look for strong sativas, but this 20% indica helps round out the effect.  I was able to "disappear into my work" for hours afterward.”"
DoctorSmoke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1388223,"“Disappointing, and it's the grower's fault. The pack was about 15% light -- not surprising because the buds were too dry. I'm sure the weight was honest and true when originally prepared for retail but the packaging was just a thin, mini ziplock-style bag stapled to a business card. Even worse, there was too much stem with the bud. 

The cannabis was unremarkable, but an accurate assessment is impossible with the poo...”"

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1063871,"“This is some ridiculous bud. Im smokin some other top shelf quality herb right now but this is the best man, better than cinderella 99 thats one thing im smoking currently. Took 2 decent hits out a bong an im on mars. Cant describe the high but its basically a complete mind warp, i feel like im in a alternate universe. Very flavorful smoke too.”"

We were going to stay a night there and decided to smoke some Satori. Suddenly I wished to draw a picture of a swans that landing on the water and I immediately started. 
This strain definitely always significantly enhance your creativity. I wish it was little more energy, but... it's Satori”"
Zackw419,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1665321,"“I grew this strain a few years ago. Not to sound corny, but this is a very meditative strain. Its strong and it hits, but its smooth, its not too much of this not too much of that- but it gives all of itself as is. So its not like one of those easily forgettable strains. It isn't boring. But its just gives you what you need and nothing more. Both indica and sativa lovers will be satisfied.

QD5n0Y,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/satori/reviews/1139837,"“The very best high for me because of how spacey and meditative it gets. There are downsides to everything this good though, you get crazy hungry and crazy sleepy. Only babies get this sleepy I swear its impossible to be any sleepier. And the THC is so high and potent that it can lower your testosterone too much and also make your dick soft like an anti-depressant. The high may be worth it sometimes though I miss sato...”"
