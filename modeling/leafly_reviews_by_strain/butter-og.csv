Aereanna,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butter-og/reviews/1414870,"“Not bad. It's definitely smooth but I don't taste the buttery after taste (which I'm okay with honestly 😖) but it does have a fruity smell. It helps a lot with pain almost instantly and starts off with an awake happy pain free feeling them suddenly hits you with major couch lock and a heavy tired feeling. 

I like to mix it with my C4 every now and then and that causes a nice even head and body high but it causes ex...”"

It tastes like it's name sake, which is a bit weird, but I like it, It gave me more of a body high which is best for me because I have terrible pain and muscle spasms.
It got rid of my headache and loosened my neck and shoulders pretty well. 
I felt relaxed. Over all I enjoyed it.”"

switchinator,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butter-og/reviews/1330906,"“Just picked this up and must say it is smooth and buttery with way relaxed and arthritic pain drastically reduced.  Nice buds from the nicest budtenders around!”"
kmfl1988,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butter-og/reviews/1396487,"“Not a very potent strain but tasty. At first you get that warmth in the head as if it's going to be fire but that goes away then it just turns into a high you can do with or without. It reminded me of drinking maybe 2 shots of liquor or having 1 glass of wine. You won't be stoned but you'll be slightly more relaxed.”"

rpgzealot,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butter-og/reviews/1631949,"“Moist buds that smell like piney butterscotch and produced a rough, aggressive smoke. The high was (nearly) instant and intense, with a level of dizziness that made sitting near mandatory. After an hour it mellowed out into a relaxed, talkative high with serious munchies.”"

BeenBlowinOG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butter-og/reviews/1418553,"“Watching Game Of Thrones Season7 episode 4 right now after smoking some Butter OG and I am losing my mind. This strain is so smooth, a wonderful high, and this show is crazy. I'm having a blast”"
brian318,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butter-og/reviews/1386150,"“This is a really smooth smoke. When the girl at the dispensary opened up the jar, I was hit in the face with a sweet, buttery dank smell instantly. The buzz is really chill and couch locked (if overdone). Best suited for evening time.”"

switchinator,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butter-og/reviews/1330907,"“Just picked this up today and must say it does have the buttery smooth glow to it.  It also definitely creates the relation desired as well as drastically reduce my arthritic paid.  The buds are awesome and the budtenders are as well!  Can't go wrong here...!”"
Diphenhydraman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butter-og/reviews/1262108,"“Very nice strain that has all the effects of a full indica strain and some heady effects that are minimally disorienting or unbalancing. I use this before sleep for insomnia. The strain has more euphoria effects than other indicas, or so it seems at least. 

The smell of fresh flowers is very nice but it doesn't smell of butter or has any particularly unusual overtones. Just smells like an indica without coffee overt...”"
Ankush22,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butter-og/reviews/1293529,"“Just like the name says, the flavour is a nice buttery taste and the inhale is real smooth. Definitely recommended!”"

May wanna consider for personal bedroom use 😂.”"
Pikminion,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butter-og/reviews/1428032,"“Makes me sleepy and increases appetite.  It does reduce depression some, but not as much as I'd like.”"
Hanapucanna,https://www.leafly.com/indica/butter-og/reviews/1313443,"“One of the best strains for pain relief; effect builds more slowly than in some strains, but lasts well, so it's great for getting a full night's pain relief. Flavor and aroma are subtle, psychotropic effects in the higher end of mid range.”"
