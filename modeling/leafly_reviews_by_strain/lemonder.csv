dragon67,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1411012,"“smooth, mellow, relaxed high without losing consciousness! Smell  and flavor are delightful and inviting.”"
Merrill420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1357948,"“Smell is like pledge and pinesol, but softer and with a hint of that dank from the o.g. Hits incredibly smooth with a mild aftertaste similar to the smell. All in all a great example of this strain grown by Seattle's Private Reserve!”"
ReginaldWrigby,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1355549,"“Most recent batch at Diego Pellicer had a Terp Total of 4.85%.. This strain is starting to creep into my top 5, just like the high 15 minutes after a nice bong rip. Nothing comes close if you're looking for a bud that smells lemony or citrusy and tastes just the same... Get the word out, this strain is legit!! Check out Diego Pellicer while they still have it.”"

Had some to celebrate the halfway of a big hike in the mountains, the guys at the dispensary said this is the best weed in the state right now and I agree!”"

kelseyjenkins07,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1418474,"“This is the best strain I've yet to try! I am in love 😍. 
I have dry mouth and eyes when I'm not high, and this doesn't give me cotton mouth and make my eyes hurt when I blink! It must be witch craft 😂”"

Then I heard a sound / and it got me all a-tingle / it was that jolly old man / Motherfucking Kris Kringle! Santy Claus brought me / a sack fulla dank / "Lemonder," he called it / and that bag hella stank. It smelled quite like lemons / It smelled like Pine-Sol / and after I blazed that whole eighth ...”"

jeweloree,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1595557,"“I wouldn’t be surprised if a luxury candle maker tried to make candles out of it. I would probably buy some. When you smoke it there’s a pleasant aftertaste that reminds me of yellow skittles. The high is relaxing and fun but not very affecting of the mind. It’s great for hanging out with people who aren’t smoking with you, so it doesn’t put you too much in a different headspace from them.”"
Two_Ton_Tim,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1647930,"“This is one of the most beautiful buds I've ever seen, and the smell is outrageous! Quickly one of my favorites by just looking and smelling. Good high, great taste!”"
misspontiac31,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1575079,"“one of my faves, I'm a smoker of 36 years and this one will get me high 
consistency is always good , not bone dry has stickiness, smells as good as it tastes, VERY LEMONY”"
Ostrodamus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1749177,"“I enjoyed this strain. It wasn't overpowering at all in either taste, scent or effects. Smells of lemons and flowers, tastes a bit lemony as well. Beautiful buds, tons of trichomes. This strain relaxed me, and also gave me that warm feeling like I was basking in the sun lazily. It did give me dry heavy eyes, but that isn't a reason not to smoke this. I'd purchase this strain again.”"

foofeefog,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1553026,"“Picked up an 1/8 about 3 weeks ago and now that I’m all out I have to ask if I want more of it. This batch was so sticky! Probably one of the stickiest buds I’ve ever come in contact with. It’s smell is what really brings this strain home. It fully embodies both its lemon and lavender parents. It’s affects hit me hard and had me thinking I was a space ranger for a good portion of the day. It earned its top shelf pric...”"
PrincessLeia1111,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1707854,"“I am SO happy that a budtender at my local dispensary recommended this strain to me.  I smoke mainly to relax and to get relief from anxiety. I generally favor sativa-dominant hybrids... if there is too much indica, I become anxious about how "numb" my body starts to feel. 
Anyway, I initially wasn't sure what to think of this interesting mix of strains. I wasn't "in love" with it, but I would say I was "in like" wit...”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1761501,"“Lemon smell. Lemon wood taste. Great hybrid effects. Big euphoria without anxiety. Body relaxation without an iron blanket. Wa Seattles private reserve is a staple for sure. I will get again. I recommend for daytime use, treating mild asthma,  and acid reflux. Great for anything. Superb functional happy strain. Lemonder, get some. This stuff goes quick.”"
shaedolf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonder/reviews/1329033,"“Relaxing along with a rush of happy thoughts. :) Picked this up at The Gallery by Seattles Private Reserve!! Smells like lemons and pine needles, smooth smoke with a citrusy flavor! Definitely going to buy some more”"
