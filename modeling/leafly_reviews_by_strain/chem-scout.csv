Chem Scout

NeonPablo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1390797,"“The most balanced hybrid I've come across. There's a euphoric heady high, combined with major body relaxation and pain relief.

The buds are beautiful, super frosty with a sweet and pungent bouquet.”"
Mex420x,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1331638,"“Bought some from Harbor Side in Oakland. It was a bit more pricy BUT WELL WORTH IT! I prefer Indicas and this one didn't. The jar label said it was a 50/50 and its made from Chem 91 X GSC. So smooth and the indica can be felt heavy. Definitely for night time such has after a long day at work or stress has well.”"
MetalLord13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1331640,"“2 hits and done for a good hour zoning off staring at the clouds out my front window. Very relaxing.”"
edgydrifter,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1397279,"“A very heady smoke.  Much more euphoric and enlightening than any indica I've had in a long time, and even more so than many of the sativas I regularly enjoy.  Body high is relaxing and a little tingly, but is not accompanied by any significant couchlock.  Likewise, the euphoria isn't paired with any noticeable reduction in mental clarity or focus. Good duration.  This is a pretty remarkable strain.  Can be equally e...”"
rgram206,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1366605,"“Very lovely strain I got some chem cookies, as soon as you hit it you will feel it immediately, it hits with a wave of relaxation and pain killing effects that will leave you feeling great.”"
GreenGolfGuy21,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1375808,"“Chem Scout is easily on my all-time favorites list.  I would even say it's in my top ten.  Beautiful buds that sparkle when sunlight hits them.  Very heady-high, dissociative at times.  Ideal for nighttime use.  Great to watch a movie and let your mind float away into a great nights sleep.  I broke my back a couple years ago and this strain not only knocks out my pain, it takes my mind off it as well.  Anyone with ch...”"
rgram206,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1331639,"“Really great score getting chem cookies, very earthy and exotic taste and smell cures all my back pain great for aptite.  Stone is heady and fun with a raw body high to boot. All in all this is a new favorite strain of mine pretty heavy dough.”"

tilldeathfitness93,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1366412,"“New favorite strain for MANY reasons: smell, feel, taste, crispness, freshness, non-psychoactive traits and of course, its' psychoactive characteristics as well. I have been consuming Marijuana on a daily basis for approximately the last 10 months and this strain still gets me nice and ripped. What I love most about the smell, both pre-burn and during smoking is that it reminds me immediately of the first time you sm...”"
TreyDedicated,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1397280,"“Best strain I've had to date. Instant euphoria. Distinct taste. A complete mood changer. Great herb.”"
maestraDee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1417610,"“This is my favorite strain so far. It tastes like warm baked cookies coming in. I feel uplifted, motivated and relaxed.
I usually experience low energy throughout my cycle and now I feel like I have a natural pick me up. It adjusts to your situation Have to drop off homemade cookies (you baked while high on Chem scout)  with the neighbor, great! Wanna chill in the tub, even better! I love this strain and would defini...”"
JackFlash92,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1384773,"“Chemdawg Cookies is a powerful strain that gives you major face melt/head bang after about 4 tokes but don't let this phase you it turns into a nice full body relaxation and gives you bad munchies!! Little bit of giggles and an all round feeling of contentness. Nice tasting bud with a slight bit of paranoia 
5/5 good bud”"
errzy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1379637,"“While not being a fan of either chem dog or GSG, somehow this mix worked wonders. The MDMA of indica! 

Can't wait to get more.”"
eparks88,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1283588,"“A very mild indica. Takes the edge off of a trying day without sapping energy. Happy without being too giggly. Possibly may give you the munchies though.”"

winterland6977,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1353269,"“I love this stuff.  Some of my favorite night time medicine.  Beautiful, frosty nugs that have the classic cookie taste with the gas from the Chem.  Great strain.”"
JoshLoc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1361423,"“Found the most beautifully grown batch of this flower. Lots of purple and lime green and super dense.  Smells really dank with some spice/pepper in the background. Starts out really heady and then a decent body high sets in. The body and head high don't complement each other for me like some hybrids do. I love Chen butI've never been that big of a GSC fan, so I kind of expected it wouldn't be my favourite. Had to try...”"
GrapesonGrapesonGrapes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1470962,"“Focusing and cosmic are what first come to mind when I think about this beauty. The flowers are a deep emerald green, with nice speckles of light green and purple. Relatively fluffy for an indica hybrid. The aroma catches you right away and tingles the nose. Sweetly pungent and earthy. The smoke is smooth and earthy, a tiny bit skunky. The effects are really nicely balanced and not too sedating at all. Carrying the b...”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1325556,"“Incredibly smooth smoke, Definitely seemed to take on more girl scout cookie type characteristics as far and look and scent but had a slightly sweeter edge to it. Might be slighty indica dominant but this is basically a hybrid to me. Very cerebral but definitely got a good pain relieving body high along with it. 4.5/5”"
herfave,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1424397,"“FIRST THINGS FIRST *this is the business. Me and my boy use this for pain. this is wonderful for immediate relief. say goodbye :headache, cramps, loss of appetite, and also provided some insomnia relief. Last night, i was waiting for my advil to kick in at at 5AM- and couldn't even sit forward to grind this up before sweating and throwing up. With sweaty hand i turned on the fan. when a wave of shivering stopped- i t...”"
sianb27,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1520442,"“first time trying this strain and it's absolutely incredible, perfect for a smoke before bed or after a long day at work! completely relaxes you.”"
WMDVulcan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1611588,"“I'm not much of a fan of indicas because I like to be productive after I smoke but this strain blew me away. Its great if you just want to forget about all your problems and just sit down and relax. I enjoy conversing with a close friend while on this strain because it clears the mind and helps you appreciate yourself, those around you, and life. In my top 5 strains and definately my favorite indica.”"

EastCoastMtnTribe,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1785481,"“And then Chem Scout entered into my life. This strain looks like heaven, smells like you walked into the Dankest, loudest dispensary and tastes like Happiness. So delicious!!! I just love when I get my hands on a strain that tastes this good. Makes you feel so warm, fuzzy and relaxed. Great strain to come home to after a busy day.”"
FatBranden,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1634713,"“One of the most potent strains I’ve come across, very euphoric,  extremely tasty  especially through glass, will be Definitely picking up some more in the future. And I have dabbed it before, can’t go wrong there.”"
Cmia77,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1726330,"“It relax’s for pain and stress. Great for night time.”"
KingCoe96,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1277902,"“Highly potent strain that delivers a strong body high that sticks around for a while. Surprisingly doesn't make you all that hungry or couch-lock you.”"

imwrecked12345,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1365599,"“Really nice strain. Get a strong euphoric buzz and feel so relaxed once the effects start kicking in. Nice tasting and a pleasure to have in my lungs. Also found it to be a little bit of a creeper where all of a sudden hits you and feels like your face is melting but so enjoyable. Smells nice and produces a nice blue smoke. Top strain. 5/5. 
Also gets me paranoid which is always a nice little treat.”"
thebudreview,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1368271,"“I find this strain to definitely be one to smoke when you're ready to really chill out and settle in for the night. I got a very heavy head and body high when smoking it via Swishers. Now I'm wishing I would have vaporized it, because I think the cigarillo gave the bud a harsh flavor. Usually though, flavor and effects correlate in my experience, that's why I feel I should have just vaporized it; the effects were spo...”"
prtyredd,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1326405,"“It is hard for me to find Indicas that really make me relax. The taste is a bit strong very pungent in smell as well. This is one Indica I would recommend especially for pain relief.”"

delusionalart2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1275222,"“Very good strain to put in your bong. I rolled up two nice ones and put the remainder in the bowl and tried it out and let me tell you my shoulder pain is gone and so is my knee pain. Not even stressed about the days problems man. Great deviation of GSC.”"
winterland6977,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1367485,"“As with everything I have tried from I.C. Collective, Chem Scout is top shelf.  Two of the greatest strains of all time combine for one hell of a starchild.”"
maidenoregon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1280214,"“super dense tasty flower! very high thc content and is not for rookies. helps with insomnia, and stress relief. definitely one of my favs!”"
thrashincashionn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1320593,"“I got this for the first time yesterday. I smoked about 2 hours before going to bed and while I was awake and active I felt amazing, however when I laid down and tried to shut my eyes I got the spins and a lot of anxiety came on. 

All in all is this a good strain? Absolutely 

People with anxiety/panic disorders? Might not be your best bet”"
dogpound1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-scout/reviews/1593888,"“New favorite strain! Fruity gassy funk. Icky, and smooth. Awesome cross between Chemdawg 91 and GSC! Not as earthy as GSC. The breeder I got this batch from in norcal is a master. It is indica dominant, but the high will transform into whatever setting you are in. Over do this strain n and you will have major face melt and couchlock! New favorite for sure.”"
