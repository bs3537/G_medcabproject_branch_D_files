Gives a relaxed feeling while keeping you energized. Does a great job at relieving my anxiety. I suffer from anxiety, PTSD, and depression.

1. Smell - It smells like butter ? I couldnt believe it but there was a faint aroma of dough and butter ... it held up to the name. 

2. Taste - It tastes a little buttery or like nothing. When I was done with each hit I realized how buttery a...”"

I am sad as I only bought an oz of it and it’s almost gone 😤 I’m in Arkansas so closest pot shop is Denver but this is a strain best known to be grown in Oregon. I’m considering going back there.”"
