Make sure to stay hydrated since this causes some serious dry mouth. The high comes on hard. It's a great balance of cerebral and body. Not for novice tokers. Next time this is around I will be stocking up.”"

The initial impression of it is incredible because of the look of it. The smell does not knock you off your feet, but you will reassess this after you enjoy the incredible journey it takes you on. Highly recommend for all of my fellow stoners.”"
Freyii,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-power/reviews/1347078,"“Overall this strain is very visually appealing, but lacks in the aroma department. Offers a strong body high with very little head fuzziness overall. One of the more overrated strains in my opinion, but still good bud nonetheless.”"
Sillyv,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-power/reviews/1699448,"“Solid bud, nice relaxing high. Has more of a body high than most sativa dominant hybrids. Delicious fruity scent”"

Purple Power would be great for outdoor activities like fishing or camping. Puts me in a good mood, and makes me talkative while spreading a good even body high (slight body tingle) where it needs to be.”"
