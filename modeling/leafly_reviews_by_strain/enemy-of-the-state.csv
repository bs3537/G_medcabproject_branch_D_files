However, if you're looking for a true indica, few are this good in my experience. It took away my neck pain and resulting headache in a few puffs. Gets you slow though, and thus also works great for sleep. It doesn't really get there if you're looking for any cerebral stimulation and does not produce CEV's at all. On the other hand: no paranoia, dizzin...”"

Smell isn't anything special. Only after weed. 
Taste the same. 
It's a pure Indica and you feel it. Not a total Knockout! 
EOS is sending waves into my body how no other strain does. 
Highly recomended for any muscle pains. Works even at my wife. 

Overall 9/10”"
KKjong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enemy-of-the-state/reviews/1386982,"“Real nice Indica strain, a must try if that's your thing!

Heavy and outspoken odour, sweet and spicy. Tastes just like it smell's. Real heavy body stoner.

This strain is for me a bit like Orange Bud or California Orange, a tasty and pleasant smoke, ideal for a day on the beach!”"
Primo_,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enemy-of-the-state/reviews/1394378,"“My go-to strain!
Been smoking this everyday for a few months now because of its beautiful medical perks. Anxiety almost fully dissapears and it keeps my head cool and mellow no matter what mindset im in or how my day has been. It also gives a great buzz throughout your body which really helps those muscles to relax.  
Highly recommend this for any indica lover, if you like sativa this might not be the strain for you....”"

Mamen3000,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enemy-of-the-state/reviews/1387577,"“Great evening treat, it alleviates pain and provides a sweet relaxation for both body and mind. Interesting taste, fruity and spicy yet leaves a floral aftertaste.”"
Skman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enemy-of-the-state/reviews/1523332,"“Great Indica - made my body feel relaxed and hrs you slowly. Taste wise for me personally it’s not what I like. Real strong notes of spice. But all in all a great indica.
No paranoia, headaches, dizziness, anxiety.”"
