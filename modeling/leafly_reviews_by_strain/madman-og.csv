Really though, Madman is a miracle for my body/back pain, and I immediately "sigh" that stress out. You sigh deep & that feeling relaxed your stomach on exhale. Medicating with it out of a volcano just now (I GOT A VOLCANO BITCHES!!!) was just extra amazing. I highly recommend it, worth every penny so you can really taste the terpenes & never have to feel a burn i...”"
HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/madman-og/reviews/1381812,"“Another great Indica for getting much needed sleep/relaxation. Madman OG has a deep green hue and sour/piney scent. After a few weeks hiatus, I decided to give some new strains a try, and Madman came highly recommended. Madman's smoke is rich and my experiences conclude that the high is slow to take hold, but it's potent and it lasts. Perfect night-time sleep aid or post-workout recovery strain.”"
kushedpops,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/madman-og/reviews/1381811,"“this strain definately creates a mellowman. Has that oG funk smell, smooth but hits to the chest. The strain i have taste like coffee, went back to check the flavors and sure enough there it was! Was debating glad i hadnt.”"

prendelo507,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/madman-og/reviews/1476575,"“I loved it !! It's seriously amazing. I have intense insomnia and anxiety yet this manages to relax me so well that I sleep soundly and awake well rested. It won't make you sleepy though it'll just relax you so don't worry if you're in a social setting/using in the daytime. It's a miracle for me tbh only cons are that it does give munchies and--at least for me--the high doesn't last that long and it goes from 100 to ...”"

This one is really really physical and body relaxing just what I need help with eating, SLEEPING, pain and stress. This is a great strain for actually getting the indica power to knock out what ails you and still able to function, I mostly smoke Indicas because of my crazy anxiety, Sativas like ghost train haz...”"
MrCrohns,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/madman-og/reviews/1508924,"“Nice body euphoria and mental effects.  Very strong appetite stimulation which I don't like, but might be useful for some.  LA Confidential is an odd strain for me and seems like a strange choice to cross with OG Kush.”"

skywalkaflaka,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/madman-og/reviews/1364082,"“Has a very earthy, diesel, gonna-make-you-pass-out type of smell. With a nice mix of light green buds and dark green, sometimes purple leaf-remnants. Very potent, and tastes like diesel the most but otherwise is exactly like the smell.”"

I felt a bit of euphoria as well.  Good strain for anxiety or to distress and wind down.”"
outeryou,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/madman-og/reviews/1603118,"“This is my first time trying this strain. I normally get Blue Dream. Mmo is a Super nice hybrid, i would say, 50/50. Comparable to Bd in effects. I.E. motivating, ready to work, or do something productive/creative. Stimulates my motor functions to get up and move. Ill-effects may include some slight anxious and/or paranoid feeling, nothing to heavy, very minimal but it can be their  :):):)”"

The THC level was 20% & right after smoking i became happy & euphoric  followed by the wonderful body high which can lead to sleep. Buds were green with orange pistils & a light cover of trichomes over the dense buds. Taste & smell was piney, woody, & earthy to me. LA Co...”"
ChemicalGeorge,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/madman-og/reviews/1627354,"“This strain is DANK. Apart from it being dank this strain is so SMOOOOOTH. I took big hits from this one and I barely coughed at all! But man, don't plan on doing anything to productive after this strain, because you're going to want to get ready to take a nap! I warned you.”"

It took a few minutes to hit in, and about 10 minutes to fully take effect ...so go little by little hah. Everything went sloooooow, I could only focus on the chirping of birds and the wind blowing by. I was so relaxed and on a beautiful high... I fell asleep after about 20 minutes.. for a couple hours. Awesome.”"
