leahwaz73,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-meringue/reviews/1413708,"“Lemon meringue has an amazing lemony citrus smell with a hint of diesel. Lots of crystals and orange hairs. It hits fairly smooth with a sort of creamy earthy aftertaste. It immediately helped soothe anxiety and nausea, and you can feel the pressure release behind the eyes. If I'm in a lot of discomfort from a migraine or nausea, when the relief comes, it's like a huge weight is lifted off me and I find myself finall...”"

It smells like a lemon, creamy, sweet sort of smell with big dense buds that are dark purple with light green and kit if orange hairs. It's a great bud for the day time that is a sativa dominant but can reallly be smoked at any time of the day. It's very enjoyable and willl give you a happy euphoric high.”"
