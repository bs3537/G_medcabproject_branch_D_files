1 big bong rip and 1 was high. 
A full bowl and I was heavily medicated -(Higher then smoking 3.5gs of the mid grade most people in my area smoke)
I smoked 3gs out the bong and I was extremely high! (I didn't remember anything I did during the time I peaked)

This stuff tastes & smells NOTHING like "diesel, coffee, or earthy"…the best description would be more like a slightly cedar-ish hops flavor, very clean on the inhale, easy on the lungs. The flowers are tight chysanthenum-like nuggets, with few leaves. Flower time is about 10 weeks, and it's a slow vegger, too.”"

The high is somewhat social, so its great to kick back with your friends.”"

This stuff has a great piney flavor with the effects being very similar to a sativa, you will be wanting to be doing SOMETHING. However, if you are tired and ready to pass out, this will knock you out so do not even worry about it.

This is the indica strain I have heard about, because i have tried a few indica's  and they were amazing, but this screams the indica buzz I have heard and read about. I did a dab of it, and another first, I dabbed Brass Monkey Nugg Run Shatter (https://www.brassmonkeyca.com/concentrates/shatter/) and the taste and the smell were described perfectly by Lea...”"

TheOfficeOC,https://www.leafly.com/indica/platinum-og/reviews/1478040,"“This great all- around strain is an important stress reliever for the everyday smoker, and the patient who has a hard time falling asleep at night.  Stemmed from OG Kush , Master Kush , and one unknown parent. This flower can alleviate any physical pain, and regulate hunger.”"

jakl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/platinum-og/reviews/1095635,"“First time trying platinum og from BPG - I was positive & introspective as I fell asleep. Pretty sure inward-eye describes this self-analysis trip. I was overcome with child-like wonder, observing my own way of interacting with the world/society - trying to improve, while ignoring my ego.
Physically relaxed, I had a calming buzz and sunk into my blankets for sleep.”"

I like the high overall, nothing that special though.  Great for bedtime bowls and insomnia. Not as great for daytime seshin' or lighting up at a party.  Couch-locks you pretty hard.”"

The classic high we all experienced at one time in our fond memories of smoking. I love to smoke and drive but I wouldn’t ever on this strain as it’s really got a big body and head high. I’d rather drift off with some relaxing thoughts than concentrate on anything else than how wonderful it feels. I can see it become overwhelming to some p...”"

It has a decent head high for being indica heavy. More of a relaxing high than a fun one if I may be honest. Definitely got the munchies but it wasn't too bad.

Good indica, decent sativa effects. Strong, but not the strongest. Can't say for certain if it was worth the $15/g”"

MarijuanaWriter,https://www.leafly.com/indica/platinum-og/reviews/1246517,"“Being a heavy consumer of cannabis often times I do not experience the  strong buzz that others do. The Kush strain in general is usually a phenomenal one. In this instance Platinum OG was not a disappointment. The people at Maggie's Farm delivered a beautiful strain of this ganga. Within a few moments the first few hits kick in. This OG had a very sweet almost kiefy profile.”"

This strain doesn't have a strong odor so it's safe to prepare this strain inside. Its effects are almost felt instantly especially when prepared in paper. I personally have only experienced this herb with a joint but I'm pretty sure it's effects are the same using different methods as well. This strain provides instant pain relief and mental relaxation.
