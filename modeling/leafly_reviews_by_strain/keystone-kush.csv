Super  review!heavy stone with a nice mellow headband kind of buzz, but the real peculiarity about this strain is the taste, I swear to you it taste like straight up Sleepytime tea. Fitting, for such a sleepy time kind of weed ✌️”"

Form: Shatter
*This strain is the same genetic makeup as Joliet Jake but with I guess with more of a CBD percentage*

Taste 3/5 Definite Katsu taste, also has a hint of that CBD taste

Relief 5/5 Great for getting me to sleep, and helps with my back pain

leeannec,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/keystone-kush/reviews/1795274,"“This was a heavy hitter for me and i'm not a lightweight. I used it for sleep and pain and it was excellent! I've only used the vape. That being said,  it only took maybe 4 hits to knock me out. Great strain in my Keystone state!”"

LiveInTheMoment,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/keystone-kush/reviews/1800853,"“Very relaxing strain that I think benefits insomnia, stress, and anxiety. Great for PM use or mixed with a stronger sativa for daytime use, to curb any anxiety. Equally a very tasty strain (in concentrate form, vaped at low temp). It seems to do a bang up job for joint & muscle pain too.”"
