Perfect in concentrate or flower. Micxes with anything. 
This was also the 1st strain my hubby felt euphoric, energetic & focused.

leahwaz73,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/future/reviews/1367913,"“This strain is pretty amazing. Nice smooth taste, not harsh at all, and a fun tingly body buzz. Extremely uplifting and euphoric. Great to unwind after a stressful day. It helped with my nausea and anxiety and made me feel like the future might not be so bad (pun intended). Be prepared for dry eyes and dry mouth though”"

First of all the flower is beautiful orange reddish hairs & trichs everywhere. One of the most coated strains I've seen. The concentrate is even better. I get couch lock when I consume too much.

Was on sale for $20 an 8th and I have to say that the buds were very Soft and not all dry and crumbly like old bud is. Once you take that first rip, you'll feel a rush of euphoria, but what I love most is that it is not over whelming what so ever. Great strain for anxiety, and those with nausea.”"

I'm happy and relaxed with a lovely head high. I can feel my muscles relaxing and my pain is much better. The only negative is that I'm a little dizzy. Since I have no desire to get up I don't mind so much. I will definitely get this again!”"
JohnHoward,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/future/reviews/1379045,"“Wow! Packs a real punch. Best taken in small hits. Long-lasting, euphoric stone with very relaxing body effects and an overall feeling of calm and well-being setting in after an initial rush. Also seems to distance me from pain.”"

It hits with a deep body relaxation almost instantaneously. She provides a very nice body buzz and a deep euphoria. The flowers are a beautiful bright crystally green, with little bits of orange. They are compact, but break up very nicely. The aroma is earthy as hell, with some lime and fuel undertones. The flavor is as ear...”"

In flower form the amount of trichomes is ridiculous when I put some in my grinder it took me 10 minutes to get everything back out of the grinder. The trichomes were stuck to the grinder almost like a glue, that gave me my first clue how potent it was. 
The smell is like kush & GG4 so is the high.  But with a uni...”"

It really helps my back pain and muscle tightness. Then later as you are relaxing you start to feel a nice comfortable sleepy feeling allowing me to fall into a nice deep sleep (with a big fat grin on my face). This is one of the few strains that covers all of my medical needs. Thank you Harvest ...”"
BriLindsey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/future/reviews/1613284,"“Have only tried in a concentrate(shatter wax) but I absolutely love this particular strain. It's a 50/50 hybrid that's both intense and bold feelings and flavors. It is wonderful for pain and anxiety. So far my favorite hybrid because it literally treats all my symptoms and get it regularly for that very reason. Definitely recommend anyone try it in any form of use you can get, best strain I have come across period.”"

This one gives you that feeling in your throat, that frog feeling.  Love that. Not all strains give me that.  I just picked up this strain on bottom shelf, still the same great high.

Things are funnier, I make puns in my head throughout the high, but I definitely have trouble focusing on one task at a time. Super fun for hanging with friends during the day time. Also great for cleaning my apartment. Not the best for chilling solo.”"

So unbelievably strong. More anxiety/paranoia than I would expect from a heavy Indica. And didn't aid my sleep, actually kept me awake and I felt hungover the next day.
