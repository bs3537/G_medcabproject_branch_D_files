BigSmoke503,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-candy/reviews/1414272,"“This version of Space Candy was purchased at Fresh Buds PDX, Batch #10862. It's currently my favorite strain to smoke. The aroma of the flowers is sharp and biting, in a good way. Lots of pine and lemon aroma in the nose, with a real sour (good way, again) smell, like a lime. Visually, it's hard to tell if it's dark green or purple, there are so many white crystals and red hairs on these dense nugs. 
The smoke is fla...”"

TheFriendlyViking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-candy/reviews/1380897,"“Space Candy is an out of this world concentrate I got from processor Honu . Listed as a hybrid with a total cannabinoids of 72% with a shatter consistency.

The high is a uplifting happy high that had me chatting and laughing.

The flavor on this one is pretty amazing stuff that remind me of grape drink (sugar water purple) it is a very clear sweet grape flavor that is a little medicinal. Very tasty!”"

cgwinn1985,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-candy/reviews/1412998,"“Strong out the gate, and fades into a more mellow head buzz after a while. Decent strain though. Makes me kinda loopy for 20-30 mins after it kicks in. Nice and relaxed after the spacey essence fades.”"
Therealcastro44,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-candy/reviews/1276360,"“Purchased this strain from my caregiver for the first time about 3 months back, now it is my go to evening strain. Easily one of the best smelling/ tasting strains iv come across. Tastes just like it smells, Grape soda and berry candy. Flawless. The buds reminds me of GDP as far as looks go, orange hairs reaching out of pale purple buds that are coated with trichiomes. After vaporizing you feel awake for about a half...”"

Vision is narrow, but accented in a way that triggers an almost physically pleasurable response. Very moving. Ability to function continues to deteriorate while mood elevation increases. Music is close to being the best, but the bewilderment and positive bias prevents much emotional nuance. High can be a bit distractin...”"

IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-candy/reviews/1655308,"“Unique strain that smells and tastes like a candy green apple and looks almost like coral with a range of colors. Very resiny and covered in crystals, would be hard to manage without a grinder but still a surprisingly smooth smoke. Nothing too strong in any direction but puts me a relaxed good mood.  Definitely worth checking out but bag appeal alone will have people doing that without any recommendation. 4.5/5”"

I love it and will be very sad when I get to the end of it.”"

From what I understand this is Sativa dominate. Who cares? It was a perfect high and relief. It has some of the visual effects of many Sativas, stony, but, also is relaxing as much as it can be uplifting and euphoric.  It does have the potential to make you giggly and have ravenous appetite.

The colour of it is super dark almost grey, the taste of it is sweet with a hint of butane, the smell is questionably normal. The high makes me clench my jaw, that is when I'm not talking my head off. Space candy takes me into space where I can get lost for hours. It's not the strongest high, but it's still a high.”"

When smoked, it gives off a light fruity taste. It is sweet, almost like an apple, almost citrus.
