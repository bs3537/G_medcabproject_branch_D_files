vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-kush/reviews/1380531,"“Excellent arthritis med! I had a tough couple of days, and this nearly eliminated my pain. Body was *so* comfortable, and just enough head to entertain randomly  meandering thoughts. No auditory enhancement, but music had CEV at times, a quality that I want more of. I had a big dinner just before I vaped, and had the munchies anyways.  This is good for those of you who need to stimulate appetite (not I). Have beverag...”"

ALittleGrass,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-kush/reviews/1331850,"“Very good body and head high. The high felt like it lasted 6 hours, maybe longer. Made me feel super sleepy and calm, a very good strain to use for ADHD, it seemed to help me a lot. The taste wasn't too bad, it wasn't very strong, earthy and coffee more than sweet.”"

to my taste I would suggest something more clear and less immobilizing... I can only watch TV now, even talking is hard... lazy like a sloth... I think it will be useful to calm down before bed.”"
Lisaashley,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-kush/reviews/1176671,"“This strain really helps with putting you to sleep with no nightmares.

GPL56,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-kush/reviews/1663279,"“I tried WK because I was interested in the Pax Era vaporizer and WK seemed to be the best strain for my need, that being treating insomnia. It is interesting how strains have common yet different effects of different users. There are other strains that do not claim to be as effective to induce sleep but are more effective for me. PK works best for me, Kos is also very effective, and WK is somewhat effective. 
WK is v...”"
Jesse.,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-kush/reviews/1336099,"“One of my new favs. Some of the dankest weed I've yet to smoke too. Great medium sized caked out white buds with a earthy spicy aroma. The taste is similar to the smell with a slight pepper taste lingering after the exhale. If your a fan of heavy hitting kush do not pass this one up! beginners may get major couch lock though.”"

       The taste of this bud was very plant like and had a little citrus twist to it. 

Smell:
      This strain smells very plantish with a citrus twist and intoxicates the senses. Has a sour smell overall. Very appealing smell. 

Look: 
      This bud is very dense with little clumps but also flaky, crystally leafs around the outside. Long stems with thin nugs. 

High:

Its smoothness makes smoking not so harsh on the throat like some strains they seem leave a savage cough behind almost taking its victims out of that sesh.

Indicaem,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-kush/reviews/1338226,"“This is an indica that is supposed to be very sedative, but I found it to be nothing special.   The high was not sedative and did not assist with sleep. It was relaxing but not able to slow my mind down or assist me with my altering my moods.  I found this strain to make me very hungry and too earthy tasting.”"
SilentGiant,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-kush/reviews/1073796,"“Probably by far one of the best strains I have ever had. The huge nugget (1/8 oz) was very frosty and light green. And don't even try picking it or breaking it up for a joint or blunt, this stuff is beyond sticky. Took a good 5 minutes to get just a gram broken down enough. Smoking this strain through a bong/water bong/vaporizer is the best way to achieve full effects, as a joint/blunt "wastes" the bud.”"

It’s like, write lazily and listen to Hope Sandoval’s voice and even if you had a woman over you’d fall asleep in her arms and it’ll be the greatest night sleep, or my case, morning sleep.

Smell isn't over powering but sweet and earthy. Very fruity. I vape in an arizer solo so very smooth and tastes lovely. Very strong effect within a min or 2.

This is a definite keeper strain for my arsenal 👍💖👍”"
