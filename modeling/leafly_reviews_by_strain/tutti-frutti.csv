iluffchinchillas,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tutti-frutti/reviews/1392458,"“Great strain. I enjoyed the high off of it and everybody else has nice highs off of it as well. It was uplifting and for me, I didn't feel too couch locked afterwards (though pretty much everybody else said they did). It was a very nice weed for just sitting down and relaxing.”"

wh67,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tutti-frutti/reviews/1218519,"“Good day-time weed. Definitely energetic, sounds are more vivid which may be due to the increased focus this strain induces. Uplifting, slight disassociation with regards to extremeties, and I'm absolutely loving it.”"

Omnisense,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tutti-frutti/reviews/1218512,"“This is a top 5 strain I have ever had.  It's taste is hardly given justice by the desciption "Fruity"(at least for the grower I got it from over a decade ago in the Seattle area).

  It has a stimulating high, well capable of cognizance and clarity in my experiences.  But this was a long time ago I had smoked this, so my memory isn't totally pure...  (And my tolerance back then was pretty darn high).

In my experien...”"
sour_diesel28,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tutti-frutti/reviews/1218520,"“This was a good way to medicate seeing as a half ounce is 125 in New Mexico, which was beyond reasonable. Great outdoor grown California smoke , Citrus scent at first then accompanied by hints of Diesel and skunk. Only takes 1 bowl to gain relief, this is mostly Sativa so it will get you going in the morning and throughout the day, I did become more "immune" to the strain after 7 grams though.”"

Orbs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tutti-frutti/reviews/1168359,"“This is a nice hybrid that stood out for me. I smoked a spliff with about 0.5g in and shared it between one other person. After we had finished the Spliff, I felt very relaxed and heavy, but at the same time also felt creative and quite mentally alert. A nice flavour, but I found it was more of a smooth, tasty aftertaste rather than the flavour hitting you as soon as you toked it.”"

I give this strain definitely a 5 starr rating. Also very fruity and earthy taste.”"
