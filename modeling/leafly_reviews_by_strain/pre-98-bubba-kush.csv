mklodt,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pre-98-bubba-kush/reviews/1413547,"‚ÄúThe pre-1998 strain of Bubba Kush has always been on my personal top 5 list of favorite hybrids.  Many of us that grew up in Southern California and during the 'Generation-Y' era feel a deep, personal connection to this strain as we smoked it in many of our early experiences with marijuana.  These genetics first became widely available at some of the 1st medical dispensaries in LA during the 90's.

This is the type of bud you used to get back in the day, and before you smoked it you were thinking the dealer stiffed you with these small popcorn buds. Some things never change.

Smell (unburned flower):  When you first pull it out it has an almost citrus scent on it.  It smells more like a nice hop used in an IPA (India Pale Ale) than the traditional skunk smell.

This indica is PERFECT after a long work-day, in the middle of the week, for relaxation followed by a deep long sleep.  Zaps pain, anxiety, but can make you lazy.  Personally, I can get a little  anxiety for a few minutes if hit too much, too quick.  However, this drawback is short lived and followed by hours of bliss.
