Blue Dot
=============
Stormfeather,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-dot/reviews/1410947,"“Hello, my name is Dot. I have been growing weed in Humboldt County for over 25 years. I created the Blue Dot strain, not someone in Sonoma County.  I crossed the Blueberry Indica with the Train Wreck over a period of 3 consecutive years. I used a blue sharpie permanent ink pen to label bags after they all processed and trimmed up. They were distributed in these packages which is why people started calling it Blue Dot...”"

AnnArbor420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-dot/reviews/1387588,"“I got this strain from ganjamamas in Ann Arbor. It was so uplifting and energetic, I cleaned my whole house. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a boost in your day.”"

KatrinaWillowtree,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-dot/reviews/1378657,"“I have smoked a lot of good stuff since the mid to late 90s in So. cal area but I would never forget smoking blue dot which my friend got as a medical marijuana in the early 2000s. It got me so high to the point where I felt I was smoking for the first time all over again. As other people have described, it is a very hard hitting sativa with cerebral and uplifting effects. I haven't tried since but I have never forgo...”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-dot/reviews/1596572,"“I have to disagree complete with StormFeather claiming the strain was his/her creating by crossing time wreck with blueberry. I have tried what is labeled & for sale in AZ in shatter form Blue Dot. 
If it was TW & Blueberry I immediately would've been upset. Those two strains are so played out & I'm so tired of them. Even combined I just don't like it.
The Blue Dot I purchased definitely has some sativa dominant effe...”"
Goobacca,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-dot/reviews/1172454,"“This was an amazing strain! Blue Dot is that perfect daytime strain. It kept me uplifted and functional while melting my pain away. The long lasting high was also another + Stop by Fusion Dispensaries of Welton and try some for  yourself. 💚🙌  (only a 20 minute drive from Yuma 15 from foothills)”"
bertkauf,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-dot/reviews/1598594,"“A very enjoyable sativa high that started with good energy and feel good then settled into full relaxation.  Strong but not overwhelming; I never felt mentally impaired or blurry and was able to concentrate.  When I settled into a chair and gave into the high I became very relaxed, even drowsy.  One of the nicest.  Very pleasant.  Blue Dot hits the spot.”"
95SuperSkunk,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-dot/reviews/1573341,"“I read the reviews of this strain and seen the photos, and I am convinced people are getting this strain mixed up. Some reviewer stated he created the strain and his name was "Dot". Maybe he did, but I can say 100% that it was a medical club strain. Anybody who went to the bay clubs in 99 an 2000 have seen it. I bought it frequently. It was sold in a fancy prepackaged white tin labeled Farmacy, and had a blue garage ...”"

John18,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-dot/reviews/1608856,"“I purchased Blue Dot from a dispensary in Los Angeles, on La Brea Blvd, The Yellow House, back in 2003-2010,(approximately), before they were shut down for tax evasion), and it was always a big deal when Blue Dot hit the scene.

Everyone wanted the Blue Dot! I remember the smell as sweet and the taste as quite pleasant.

The effect was more sativa, I remember, but the overall experience was great.

I have not seen Bl...”"

Good mental high
Good for the daily smoker”"
aggybum,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-dot/reviews/1303092,"“Definitely one of the best high's I've ever experienced. The dispensary I bought it at is also always out of stock because their employees can't get enough of it either! Gives you lots of laughs and is super relaxing, so it helps with my anxiety, and by the time my high is gone, it becomes more sedative and helps you ease in to sleep so well.”"
dawgwings,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-dot/reviews/1261502,"“Blue Dot, on a Happy 4/20! Fantastic Genetics! White Widow crossed with NL #5, and some Skunk and Big Bud? Oh Baby, absolutely outstanding, and highly recommend. Got a great cut of this at 20% THC, and some terrific pain relief also. Berry and fruity smell and flavor, with some creeper qualities that last accordingly. Very smooth, and well worth the donation, ENJOY!!”"

teenyse,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-dot/reviews/1795500,"“My bf and I smoked it after dinner on Friday. We’d had some drinks already, so we were feeling happy. Smoked a blunt of blue dot while waiting for Uber. By the time the car got to us, we were laughing and chatting and feeling really good. Definitely social, fun times weed that elevates your mood but gives a clear head high. I probably could’ve worked (I’m a writer), but instead we bought some seltzer (the friend of m...”"
