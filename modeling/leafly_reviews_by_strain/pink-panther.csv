akolr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-panther/reviews/1387211,"“My dispensary gave me an extra gram for my order, so I thought I'd try the Pink Panther after having read an article about it. Apparently, it's a rename of Etta Seeds' Pink Plant.

I experienced a little couchlock, felt like I could just sit and chill without feeling like I was going to pass out and go to sleep. Very uplifting for me, with a decent amount of creativity boost. The pain in my foot from an old injury wa...”"
benjathelion,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-panther/reviews/1360993,"“This has become one of my favorite strains. I find it to have all my favorite characterisitic sativa effects without the drawback of excess nervous energy and racing thoughts which sativas sometimes induce in me. I find it uplifting, fun, playful in mood, without being overstimulating or racy. It seems equally suited to both outgoing activity and cozy relaxation. Specifically, I find that it pairs well with activitie...”"

fueledbyham,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-panther/reviews/1351350,"“This strain is so great I had to write my first Leafly review about it. 

Got this in concentrate form and wow is it potent. Don't know where people are getting the idea that it's indica dominant. Had me writing screenplays and learning guitar for a good 3+ hours. Good strain for those who want to get things done”"
Kingly1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-panther/reviews/1353515,"“Don't usually like sativa dominate strains but got this anyway.  The smell is probably the yummiest of any bud I've ever had, the taste just like it smells. the buzz is hard hitting at first then relaxes after about 10 minutes to the happiest and most lovable high. snuggle up with someone or something and watch loony tunes.  it the happy euphoric buzz of the sativa with the body drag of a potent Indicia. Not for thos...”"

Chunksoup,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-panther/reviews/1351348,"“One of the coolest strains I've found so far. Great by itself- a bit of a creeper. Unique, however, because of of its synergistic effects when blended with high energy sativas like Super Silver Haze or J-13. It not only brings out the best in other strains, but it adds an ethereal overtone to everything, especially when blended with already-cerebral strains like Northern Lights and such. Definitely a favorite and one...”"

matteroll,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-panther/reviews/1351349,"“Got this delivered to my door by my dispensary. Lab tested to be 24% THC if i remember correctly. This strain has a very nice piney smell and the aroma is STRONG so if you are trying to hide it, put it in a mason jar (smell proof)!  The taste of the strain is really earthy/piney/earthy and it is surprisingly smooth. Barely coughing with this strain but it still gets you REALLY high. The high is really nice. It is a b...”"

Stonedform,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-panther/reviews/1141400,"“A beautiful red-pink hue, Pink Panther is that rare Sativa with a gorgeous colored flower and the potency to boot. Recently picked up a batch that tested at 29.3%, the color was surprisingly still there even at that potency level. 

The smell is very sweet and fruity, but not the candy like smell of things like Black Jack or Strawberry Kush, instead it is balanced with a musky pine scent. The taste is incredibly deli...”"
mikahbrandes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-panther/reviews/1353517,"“The things i enjoyed about this pink panther was the aroma, it was so sweet and sticky situation without a grinder too, definitely found pain and anxiety relief, but the best was the couch lock considering I'm able to sleep now. Goodnight, pick this up if you can!”"

SpookyPuppy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-panther/reviews/1234801,"“Super sweet tasting, i got a lot of sweet earthy taste as well. I think this strain depends more on your mood at the time because when you are upbeat and you smoke this you'll be energized and enjoy doing activities.
