But I absolutely love it. It tastes fantastic and smells delicious. It made me feel relaxed and euphoric. I guess its great for pain, I wasnt aware of that when I bought it so thats an extra bonus.

Very strong and hit me immediately. I didnt feel the couch lock but once I came down I slept like a baby. Very ple...”"
Jayrevsabigone1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-lime-special-reserve/reviews/1390759,"“Great strain, not an indica though. If leafly did their research, this a hybrid leaning towards the sativa side. This is not a new strain either. This has been in Mendocino county for years. Awesome smoke though!”"
errzy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-lime-special-reserve/reviews/1415636,"“Just... Awesome. It was borderline psychotropic, but that's just me; I smoked four bong hits every 10 minutes, this is saying a lot for me.  Because:

1. I'm a lightweight. 
2. I don't often do bong hits. 
3. I usually don't go back for seconds, let alone 4.
4. I would have smoked more if not for falling asleep.

Oh yeah,then relax into a happy deep sleep.”"

Holy hell what an explosion of flavors. I get something different every blast, pine then lemon then earthy then sweet.
It says indica and the linage would point that way but I get way more of a sativa effect from it , I think it takes after the Northern Lights the most.

Went from coughing fit, to pain free in that short order. 
Nice flavor but was a bit rough on my throat. 

Stayed comfy and baked off my butt for a while then got the munchies and went crazy in the kitchen. 
Awesome strain and will put on my list of strains I cannot wait to try in my vape.”"

That lime taste lingers on your tounge, you get a little spaced out and giggly but you can also feel your body relax. I'd suggest drinking a traditional margarita with this smoke ;)”"
Stormtrooper8000,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-lime-special-reserve/reviews/1361539,"“Definitely one of my favorites in recent memory. It's a nice hybrid, relaxes the body, nice head high, but not too sleepy. Good for just hanging out with friends, as it keeps you pretty talkative. It's got a bit of CBD in it too which I think may help with mental clarity; rounding out the stone. The nugs are not the craziest looking in the world but they do smell very potent and limey. Ours tested at 23% thc, 4% cbd.”"

730stress,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-lime-special-reserve/reviews/1315822,"“Great smooth smoke with hints of citrus. The buds really do smell like lime/citrus as well. The limey citrus smell isn't overwhelming but definitely there. Very very dark purple nugs that look almost black.”"
stonedinthebay,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-lime-special-reserve/reviews/1361541,"“Grew this strain from a local club and it is one of the best so far. very tall and stretches fast. the buds smell great and the high is stimulating; made some bomb ass banana pancakes”"
AZVenom,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-lime-special-reserve/reviews/1431162,"“I was not a fan of this strain at all. This cos have been a bad or old batch but I  found my buds to be very dry, frail and crumbly; so much that a grinder was completely unnecessary. The aroma was very earthy and a hint ground black pepper but not very pungent. The smoke was a bit harsher than usual and the effects were very short lived. The dispensary sold this strain as a premium shelf strain as well. Side effects...”"
sweedie314,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-lime-special-reserve/reviews/1275070,"“Outdoor, $25/eighth seemed a little low for something as nice as true Black Lime. This was listed as "indica/sativa" instead of straight indica. Nothing spectacular. Tastes young and "root-vegetable...y". Short high imo.”"
samluu77,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-lime-special-reserve/reviews/1473338,"“Lovely relaxing effect but definitely hits on the indica side for me. Nap time after medicating so I could only use night time. I used a Select Elite cartridge. The taste is incredible. Never used flowers but the concentrate is enough to make me buy it and sparingly use indicas and hybrids.”"
ViviG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-lime-special-reserve/reviews/1391621,"“I always indulge when any one dispensary carries black lime...its simply delectable. makes my tongue tingle and gives me such a euphoria I sometimes forget this is an Indica.”"
PandaRose1949,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-lime-special-reserve/reviews/1411051,"“Powerful; I feel immediate relief for joint pain and pain associated with fatigue. Smells amazing, almost a pine and lime together. Would definitly recommend, but maybe not for the first timer.”"
