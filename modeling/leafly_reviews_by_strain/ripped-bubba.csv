Ripped Bubba
=============
Usernamealreadytaken,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ripped-bubba/reviews/1357612,"“This is my favorite strain so far.  It’s creative, relaxing, social, not sleep inducing.  Thank the nature mamma and weed nerds for figuring out how to make a perfectly balanced indica dominant strain.  I could smoke this to meditate, to go out dancing, to draw, to write emails, to wander around in the woods.  I can’t really think of a situation where I wouldn’t want to feel how this makes me feel...that’s like true ...”"

Eyes are closed and I'm wide awake

This makes me reflective. Objective...? 
Too soon for my heart to be Just so I'm just here.. in this moment.. fondly reminiscing other fondling moments...  

That's what all our lives are; living our moments fully as we create them, w/o knowing when or what or why we will remember some moments forever, and some never again.

JennBee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ripped-bubba/reviews/1161334,"“My Favorite !! When I smoke it I feel like I'm turned in to a Martha Stewart Hero. I have a lot of focused energy for a long time then I just slowly fizzle out and sleep like an 19 year old kid that lives at home with his mom and dad .... no cares in the world.”"

After not being physically active much due to working on a computer all day (and a deep love of crispy pork) i played tennis a lot last week and dug a hole in clay (digging i havent done much in a long time). As a result of being out of shape i was mad sore. I woke up all night with pain, ripped a couple dabs of ripped bubba, and I went straight from anxious, stressed, ...”"
peachydeuce,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ripped-bubba/reviews/1245879,"“Truly smells like seaweed to me. Doesn't have much of a taste in my opinion. It's a relaxed high. Good pain reliever. Pretty even cross for me between indica and sativa. I feel relaxed enough to be tired, but at the same time like I should get up and do something productive.”"
BrokenReverie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ripped-bubba/reviews/1268213,"“Norcanna here in California provided this magnificent strain.  It is a strong and potent hybrid that will knock out novice tokers,  just imagine some buff ripped dude named bubba.  Name suits the strain.  Highly recommended.”"
TLeafB,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ripped-bubba/reviews/1251650,"“Ripped Bubba is hands down one of my new favorite strains. Picked up some from South Coast CG, and the giant nug was so perfect I almost hated to break it up. Bright redish-orange hairs throughout, bright green mixed in, and some purples as well. Sweet, earthy, almost piney taste and aroma, with a flowery/lavender backnote. Gave me an uplifting mood boost right after smoking. The batch I had was high in THC, was cove...”"

74Tiger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ripped-bubba/reviews/1325359,"“Mild "cheese" aroma with sour/citrus undertones.  Frosty, dense nugs that go a long way, so that tells me that this plant was well cared for and got plenty of light.  This strain was a cross between "Bubba Kush" and "Jack the Ripper".  A hybrid strain of 60% Indica and 40% Sativa with test results of 19.24% THC and 0.38% CBD.  Overall I liked Ripped Bubba, it's mellow and relaxing smoke without putting me to sleep ri...”"

I've gone through more than an ounce of this stuff in the past couple weeks and it's truly shaped up to be one of my favorites. First of all, it is kiefy beyond anything I had ever seen.

col4bin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ripped-bubba/reviews/1171341,"“Tight yellowish-green clusters of small, resin-caked calyxes are very nice to look at. Mild musty cheese aroma in the jar with a faint citrus smell when broken up. Flavor is very subtle - almost tasteless, but a whisper of savory herb remains in the mouth on exhale. True sativa effect (which is a surprise coming from such dense flowers,) medium-duration, medium-intensity. Not bad, but not awesome.”"

Smoke larger amounts at night to get that hungry/sleepy indica effect that'll kick the shit out of insomnia or anxiety. Could be a little higher THC % tho in my opinion.”"

For something on the Indica side, I found Ripped Bubba to be quite energizing. The high was kind of a goofy, happy one. Definitely appropriate for an evening with friends. The only drawback with this strain I guess is that I could not think too clearly while on it. Great overall hybrid.”"

I love the smell while grinding this strain up. but The only downfall is its not that strong as far as THC in my opinion. I would probably pass this up if I were to come across this strain again. ♡ & Peace”"

Mikefu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ripped-bubba/reviews/1209949,"“Love this strain for daytime use. Allows for great focus and ability to get things done, all while surrounded by a full-body chill.  It's like being wrapped in a warm, fuzzy sweater of happiness and cheer while being able to do whatever needs to get done.  Not the most powerful, not the most heady, but the best strain for getting stuff done during a stressful day.”"

It also stopped the nausea I had completely. Not stinky which is good for urban dwellers in high-rise buildings with minimal airflow. This was good body, mind and soul medicine for me tonight. Also, I am focused enough to read without a problem. Love this strain.”"

There's a persistent, disquieting...offness. Like foods or colors that don't QUITE pair. Not bad...just, a tad below neutral.

The tingly, racy sativa surges like a current over your body. Again, the Jack clarity seems at odds with the distance of the high. The clearness does allow thoughts to flow freely ...”"
