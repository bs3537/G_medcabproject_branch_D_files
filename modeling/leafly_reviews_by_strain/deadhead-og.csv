four4beats,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/deadhead-og/reviews/1415827,"“This is a fun strain to consume in casual situations with friends, but in my experience would prefer not to use when work is needed to be done or focus is required. The effects I felt were an elevated mood, mild-to-strong body tingles and pain replacement (where any mild ache is replaced by a more enjoyable tingling sensation), and a classic, spacey head high.

HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/deadhead-og/reviews/1416118,"“Deadhead OG with emphasis on "OG." Rated five stars for its stimulating energy burst, and a slow to develop body relaxation. Deadhead is fast acting, and the OG doesn't defer too long before relaxation begins. I recommend this strain for late afternoon pick-me-ups, post-workout relaxation, stretching or yoga. I've experienced that when it comes to this strain, a little goes a long way. Enjoy!”"

I enjoy the overall experience -- taste, smoke, smell, buzz, medicinal effects -- when smoking "Deadhead" OG Kush."  I use primarily to get a good night's sleep.  There's no other strain that works better for getting really good sound sleep.  It's also great for just unwinding after a long day.  It really...”"

Amazing pain relief, and definitely a night time med because it knocked me out! No real downsides, other than the normal dry mouth and munchies. Easy to hold in, and not a taste that's bad enough to keep you away from it. (again, I'm not a smoker who can appreciate the taste or smell.) Definitly a good strain!!!”"

Overall, this is our very favorite, on a desert island pick.”"

christinachavis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/deadhead-og/reviews/1135832,"“Dead Head OG has a mixture flavor I've never tried before, but like it. =) It helps me rest, as long as I take it at night without mixing with sativa, it helps relax my muscles, increases creativity thought, and helps me focus. I believe it would make good brownies.”"
