Kara5837,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bob-saget/reviews/1352664,"“So I like to start off by saying this is the best strains I ever tried and I have tried many.  I never felt the need to write a review about any strain until now. I have thyroid problems along with low blood pressure and low blood sugar so I'm always getting panic attacks and anxiety. I can tell you that I felt I couldn't even have a panic attack if I wanted to on this strain. It puts your mind state in such a happy ...”"

IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bob-saget/reviews/1337759,"“This strain feels 100% sativa at first but had me drifting to sleep after a while. Was told a 70/30 S/I split. Fruity sweet sage smell with a chem undertone. Effects remind me of the strain Star Dawg, very cerebral high that lasts but starts to wear you out. Would be difficult to be very productive with this one but a good spacey buzz. 4.5/5.”"

The taste wasn't over powering but was definitely their. I loved how 10 minutes pasted after only one hit and I could still taste the bud.  It sticks with you. The high is uplifting and nice, and also feels full bodied, thick and full.  Great name too, you really can't go wrong.”"

NorCalChick,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bob-saget/reviews/1611730,"“Bob Saget is the dopest weed I have partaked in, in some time.  I am a veteran smoker & after two hits I am ready to begin the days journey with no stress, feeling happy & super euphoric.  Love this strain!  Also try Bob Saget 2.”"

It had its very own unique smell and it tasted just like it smelt. Highly recommended for anyone that grows and want something a little different”"
