Chemo
=============
Allie17,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chemo/reviews/1417279,"“One of my favorites, if not my favorite strain I have acquired over the years. Chemo shows you no mercy, so this strain is definitely not for the inexperienced. To start, the buds themselves were covered in crystals and trichomes, and, excuse me for my wording, but honestly had the cutest orange curly hairs I've ever seen on a bud. It was beautiful. It also smoked great. It had a very earthy and woody taste to it, wi...”"
Yorick,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chemo/reviews/1355266,"“You'll fall over if you don't have much tolerance. Very nice, heavy indica that relaxes the mind and body before summoning the ultra munchies. After that comes nap time. Amazing pain relief too! Not too smelly but potent as fuck. YES/5”"

PlatypusGuitar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chemo/reviews/1351556,"“This is a very powerful indica! The chemo I tried is around 25% THC and a cheesy aroma. It knocked me right out each time I smoked it. It is so potent that it is impossible for me to use this during daytime and stay productive. It will put me right to sleep! Which is great for the last joint before bed. With this strain, I usually don't wake up during the night and I usually always do.”"

TrustedReviewer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chemo/reviews/1344463,"“I have smoked this strain since the late 90's and can attest to it's Canadian availability and rumored medical quality. This strain completely embodies an Indica. There is a very heavy sedative effect, great for sleep, pain and appetite. Watch out for red eyes and hunger on this strain. If you have something important don't use this strain.”"

CanadianSkunk,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chemo/reviews/1353694,"“Chemo's effects were very good but was not a very enjoyable smoke as I found it to be harsh when smoking in a joint. Not saying it's bad weed, in fact it was lovely - just didn't taste all that great. Buds were dark almost dark green buds with small hues of purple. Smoke was thick and heavy and upon exhale but kinda tasted "burnt" to me. Effects were strong and long lasting.

afropunk90,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chemo/reviews/1456501,"“Really beautiful looking, and has a nice pungent woody smell. Make sure that you don't have anything important planned after smoking this because it'll have you on couch lock with a jumbo bag of chips. Nice for an evening time smoke. Great for insomnia. Definitely my go-to Indica strain.”"

Another customer I met was RCMP and she had similar problems. It was fine for pain. It reminded me of the supposed Panama Red and Thai Sticks that I used to get in the early-mid seventies. Zero paranoia.Relaxing and the music still sounds great. High recommend for pain.”"
