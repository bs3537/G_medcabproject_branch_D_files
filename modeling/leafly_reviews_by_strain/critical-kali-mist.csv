She is a goddess who in ancient tantric religion practices would take a shot of bhang (a boiled cannabis tincture) and then honor the Sacred Feminine by worshiping her through sexual practices.

It smokes smooth, but leaves a bit of an aftertaste, it is chemically to me, but maybe others would say Earthy. It isn't bad, just an for sure aftertaste. I get high pretty fast on this, and it is a full body high, like I am floating, I am smoking it right now and typing is rough!”"

This is good for when you want to watch some sports or play guitar, anything that gives you a rush. However, a slight Nausea is presenting itself.”"

The smoke is a clear hard hitting sativa that almost can cut through the high of a indica,that I had been smoking on earlier that day, clear headed high that hits you quick and wakes you up yet it's sti...”"

Not really energizing but leaves me feeling happy, light, and relaxed without feeling lethargic.
