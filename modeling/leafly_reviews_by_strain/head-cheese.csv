Head Cheese
=============
deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/head-cheese/reviews/1383278,"“😵🎆 Head Cheese is everything you could ever want from a Sativa-dominant hybrid. The high is very distinct and is perfect for waking and baking or general daytime use. Personally I could smoke this anytime, as the mood lift is so prominent that this has quickly become one of my favorite strains! The smell is so disgustingly good, like a block of parmesan cheese and a pine cone had a stillborn baby. I would recommend...”"
UncleAcid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/head-cheese/reviews/1414040,"“Despite what is quite possibly the absolute most unappealing strain name (Right up there with such high school classics as the ever so elegant strain known as "Cat Piss"), and a somewhat odd smell and terpene profile, it really tastes pretty good and always produces absolutely AMAZING effects!

I've never seen flower that high. Taste has a bit of citrus but I wouldn't say lemon but definitely still citrus. Powerful body high. Great for relaxing at the end of the day. I am about an oz a week smoker and was able to feel a distinct high from it still. Don't miss out on this if you come up on it.”"
leroythefish,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/head-cheese/reviews/1373619,"“Smooth smoke, post exhale tastes like burnt nachos but in a good way.  As I was staring at the fractals spinning in my ceiling I noticed that it felt like I was wearing a helmet made of vibrating fuzz.  Definite pressure change in my eyeballs.  Euphoric bliss with one foot on the ground: can accomplish tasks or just stare between atoms... 
Great after dinner smoke.”"

oscarstokes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/head-cheese/reviews/1437168,"“the best strain i have ever smoked thus far. i am relatively new to weed yet have been able to capture the best of what a sativa dominant hybrid has to offer. i experienced strong stop motion effects, as if i was in a stop motion movie, e.g. robot chicken. i am not usually able to participate in activities such as going to town while on any strain, however on this my experiences were amazing.”"

The bud is nice, dense and a medium forest green. Then it looks like some bud gnomes came up and sprayed it with silly string and crystals. Truly a great bud not too flashy but you know its solid. The inhale is surprisingly smooth and mild as far as taste. The exhale is pungent kind of like a good IPA beer. It hit my eyes ...”"

When I first got 'Head Cheese', I thought, "What a stupid name."

I was humbled very quickly. After partaking I ascended to heights previously unknown. It's so smooth and soft, and every time I take it I feel so grateful to be alive.

Top notch! Do yourself a favor and try some 'Head Cheese' if you haven't already.”"
