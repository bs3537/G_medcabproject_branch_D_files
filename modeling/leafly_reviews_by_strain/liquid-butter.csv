Liquid Butter

John18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/liquid-butter/reviews/1397244,"“I was lucky and got a batch of freshly "churned", Liquid Butter from SCSA dispensary.  I took a small bud and broke it up the old fashioned way by using my fingers...and, yes, I smelled my fingers. They had a citrus odor with a hint of pine; a very pleasant odor.  If I had a pound or two of Liquid Butter, I'd rub it all over my body...every nook and cranny.  I lit the bowl, and took three big hits.  I can now underst...”"
Mezy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/liquid-butter/reviews/1355280,"“Liquid Butter not my favorite indica but still a good high. On exhaling I tasted very strong notes of pine. Taking a big hit made my mouth taste like I had pine needles that had been sitting in melted butter. I wouldn't smoke this on a day I need to be up and going as it definitely brought me right back to my bed. I used this for nausea and falling back asleep. However what this strain did for me the next day was gre...”"

EpicGreenKanzi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/liquid-butter/reviews/1352165,"“Absolutely wonderful smooth indica. The high is a warm golden light that hugs you.  I am not an indica person but this is quite enjoyable.  Head a little spacey but nothing too psychedelic. Am surprised  this strain is not more well known. Oh it is as smooth as anything I have ever smoked.”"

So last week he came home with some Liquid Butter. I read up on it and I was skeptical because I always get strains to help him with sleep and they all FAIL! But.....oh my oh my, this strain right hurrrrr is AMAZING!! He's been asleep by 1am since we got this. And it's helped me sleep through my sciatic pain. And in the morning I f...”"

morgfacenorgface,https://www.leafly.com/indica/liquid-butter/reviews/1062955,"“4.5 stars... this is the strain you want if you want to feel calm, sleepy, and relaxed. I find it gives a slight mental and physical sensation bordering on psychosomatic numbness... As in, it doesn't feel like menthol, but the signals are dulled. I guess I would kinda say melty... Possibly hence the name. great for chronic pain control and insomnia... If it doesn't put you to sleep it at least takes the edge off. You...”"

jactup,https://www.leafly.com/indica/liquid-butter/reviews/1062951,"“I enjoy how hard to choose a top shelf strain can be at times. Every time I suggest some of the best strains that I have acquired, I always think of liquid Butter. The first best part about it is, When you tell someone they always ask how you made it. Nope, this is tasty smoke. The buds had trichomes as big as salt crystals. The very smell of the flower even reminds you of hot liquid butter. Growers defiantly gave pr...”"

It taste like sweet butter with a hint of that harsh pungent stint that most indca's pack. Smells like sweet bread cooking in the forest. I recommend using for relaxation at the end of the day.”"
