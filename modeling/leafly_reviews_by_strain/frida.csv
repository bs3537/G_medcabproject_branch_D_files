Frida

Dbp25,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1356528,"“Another high CBD strain lover here. Frida is a charming and disarming lady. I am not sure why it is classified as indica. It certainly is relaxing and calming, but that is due to the CBD.

Anyway, reviews of high CBD strains rarely include "this weed ripped my face off - I was soooo stoned!' That is not the point of high CBD strains. But the example I purchased from The Novel Tree certainly does what it is supposed t...”"
csmcaboy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1334356,"“Big fan of CBD strains and my expectations for them have previously been less nuggy, less sticky, less like the herb I'm used to.. and that's ok because that's the way it is. Then, along saunters ol' Frida with her super dense and sticky nugs looking large like mothers day brunch was the day before thanksgiving. It resembles a haze, like super lemon haze or other. Very enjoyable!
I would call it an all day smoker. Fo...”"
annabeanOG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1589044,"“Frida by Raven Grass is an amazing high CBD low THC strains. Very relaxing and makes you feel an interesting soft sensation around the eyes, with no overwhelming psychoactive effects.
 
I’d best describe it as the best cigarette you’ll ever have because the CBD makes you chilled out as fuck without being high. 
Great if you’re new to weed want to smoke with friends without getting uncomfortably high. 
My fiancé is a ...”"
Path78,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1334358,"“I am a cannabis novice, but Frida has already become one strain that we're going to always want to have on hand. 

Frida's high CBD content really makes itself apparent in the easy going, quick acting relaxation one gets after just a couple of hits. However, with its higher THC content than some other CBD strains, I feel a bit more fuzziness in the head than with something like ACDC.

My only mild knock on Frida is t...”"

I felt tingly and warm after vaping some flower and it was amazing how my significant musculoskeletal pain really eased away with this, as did nerve and migraine pain on other occasions. I love high CBD strains and this is an excellent sample from Raven Grass. If you smoke this you will definitely feel the THC...”"

Shibalover,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1334361,"“Terpy and not very stoney at all which should be expected from high cbd. Still felt the thc, just not very prevalent.”"
liltripster,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1557572,"“I have become more interested in CBD strains lately and ive been obtaining them from Raven Grass. I first tried 'Gilda' and that felt like a nice warm blanket and provided comfort, really great for wanting to relax after a long day.

I recently got 'Frida', also from Raven Grass, and I'd have to say this strain really provided me with some great relief to my psoriatic arthritis but I got the similar feeling of Gilda,...”"
Markelis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1624157,"“This is what I turn to as an athlete when I'm nursing a serious injury.  Pain and the inability to sleep are the main reasons I seek out high CBD strains and concentrates, and Frida...she is the Queen. 

A lot of users might feel slightly high on this, but I honestly attribute that to the extreme relaxation that takes over your body about 5 minutes into your session.  There isn't much of a cerebral feel to this, but ...”"
Jball1993,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1669722,"“This strain is the best ever. I deal with high anxiety and panic attacks and it does the job. It's also very high quality and comes from another famous strain that I've had called AC/DC. I fully disagree with the negatives saying anxiety because I can't smoke full strength strains high thc and this never makes me feel the same way. It's sister Gilda is also amazing”"
VapeQueen710,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1710575,"“Method: Select Vape Cartridge (2:1)

Aroma: LaCroix-esque (very light) lemon, fruity smell. Not much else. 0.5/1 Stars.

Taste: Stronger lemon/citrus but also stronger earthiness and dirt you get from CBD strains. Unrelated but be careful trying to vape on this for too long, quick to get burnt and at some point the burntness sticks. 0.5/1 Stars.

Feel: A very great meditative high. You can lie in bed staring up at th...”"

greencoach,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1414698,"“If you are looking for pain relief and don't want the high, this is the best I have found. 
I bought the concentrate -- and found it the best solution for pain and inflammation. Other strains had mixed results -- and I needed something without a high but with a strong CBD.”"
ohmygaha,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1334357,"“Great for pain flares and anxiety. I just discovered this strain and it's quickly climbing the favorites chart.”"
Ithyphallic52,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1354834,"“I love mixing this strain with some of my other weed. I try to balance the mix to around a 1:1 CBD/THC ratio. I have some strains that are +30% in THC that tend to be overwhelming at times so adding this helps to alleviate the anxiety / negative effects.”"
primm19,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1599439,"“I was actually looking for ACDC when the budtender recommended this strain for me. Given the two strains are related, I figured it was worth a shot.

It's described as meditative on here, and I think that's a perfect word to describe the feeling of this strain. I could never close my eyes and try to meditate while stoned, just too dizzying, but I still sorta feel like I'm in that same headspace when I'm high on this ...”"
blabervanna,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frida/reviews/1362541,"“A friend suggested this strain for my arthritis. He said he didn't get the stoned feeling. Um, I did! It was a bit harsh to smoke, but kicked in within minutes. Super relaxing and pain free evening for me. I will definitely be smoking this before bed more often.”"

I can assure people I got hit hard by the high even with a small amount. I usually smoke Sour Tsanami so not sure why that never gave me such a high. 

I will try again over time to see how it helps with my inflammation...”"
