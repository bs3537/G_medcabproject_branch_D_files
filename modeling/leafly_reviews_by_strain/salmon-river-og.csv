StayHighFolks,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1693851,"“So this beautiful batch was my first dry leaf purchase in the great state of Pennsylvania.  And I must tell you my friends that it's just the perfect strain to crush anxiety and send your day to a sweet lullaby.  Not to sedating but just right.  Kudos to the folks at Liberty!  Scent is very pleasant, wildly enough almost has a slight fishy scent.”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1344264,"“Salmon River is a beautiful strain.  Medium to dark green hues laced with deep purple. It smokes smooth and is ohhhh so relaxing without knocking you out. Five Zero Trees is my Salmon River supplier... I've not seen it elsewhere, but it's such a perfect strain I make sure to hit up Trees every couple weeks to grab it. Last week I had a really bad day and decided to treat myself to something that would calm and relax ...”"

Valkyrien,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1344265,"“Salmon River OG is one of my favorite! I find it does sneak up on you, but you aren't left waiting very long for that relaxed giggly buzz. Taste was somewhat pleasant, not sweet but not a harsh smoke.”"
Joyw7,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1701270,"“I just picked this up in cartridge concentrate in my Pennsylvania Dispensary. I am estatic! I bought 2 now going back for 3 more for my medicine box. Strongest Indica I have found for my pain and insomnia. I have been on sleeping pills and anxiety meds at night  for sleep, pain, PTSD, and restless legs for 10 years now. Zapped me out, couldn't keep my eyes open. No anxiety, paranoia, or headache like some other indic...”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1697497,"“One if my new favorite indica's, the taste is very complex but familiar. The buzz is very strong and sticks around for a few hours.
I have the #3 phenotype. 
The flavor comes thru even more so with a vape cartridge.
Glad I gave this strain a chance, the name was off putting I was afraid it'd be salmon like.”"

I picked it up at To Shelf Budz in Milwaukie, OR. it was grown by Stone Creek Farms and boy was it tasty. it helped numb the pain from my persistent 4 day long migraine and lifted my bad mood caused by sitting under florescent lights for 3 hours at the Drs office with before mentioned migraine. I'm very happy with Stone Creek Farms amazing flower 😊”"
NaturesWayMedicine,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1693216,"“Smelling like berries, cocoa, coffee and hints of lemon; patients have been raving about Salmon River OG. It has a sweet berry flavor and undertones of lemon and cocoa that they enjoy. Patients say this flower works best for chronic pain, muscle spasm, and insomnia.”"
Jessdelaney,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1765317,"“GREAT strain. I asked the budtender for a recommendation of a mellow, relaxing strain that will help me sleep by calming down my mood and not by knocking me over with a sledgehammer. I'm not a fan of the couch glue feeling and I wanted something that was more of a gentle calm. This strain is exactly what I was seeking. It helps me get into the right frame of mind to fall asleep easily without sleeping so hard I have ...”"

Pdxkar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1625948,"“Very nice buzz, but as an indica, I would have hoped for something relaxing and sleepy. Instead it keeps me up and around past my bedtime feeling alert and creative. I am going to move it into my morning offerings.”"
Edh1981,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1735634,"“Salmon river of #4 is a very nice strain. I was pleasantly surprised by the spicy and fruity scent and the nice tight buds. Pretty heavy at first then it levels out nicely.”"
datdrungus87,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1732627,"“My favorite strain. It smells delightful, like perfumed chocolate. High 
for me is a short, intense sativa brainstorming rush and then it's groove city for hours. If you like a little sativa effect but without getting too trippy, you'll love this strain. Very productivity-enhancing for creative endeavors.”"

Greatlakesgrown,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1773709,"“If I see it local I will always pick some up.  I Specifically use it at night to help relax and get in the mood for sleep. I have a hard time relaxing and this has been a savoir. Also helps for pain. Gave me some pretty serious munchies. salmon river  tastes  earthy and like it came from a field adjacent to a river. No joke. Enjoy!”"
pattyc4kes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1694402,"“I really like this strain for my anxiety/ptsd. It brings me down and uplifts my mood at the same time.

This is a very enjoyable daytime indica. I suffer from chronic pain, anxiety AND fatigue so many indicas make me too sleepy. Salmon River does not. Instead I am relaxed and in less pain and just feel nice and stoney. I can do it first thing in the morning and I’m still up and about. HMS wins again with dense nugs.”"

Mattielb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/salmon-river-og/reviews/1792974,"“This is one of those strains that makes you realize there's more to a flower's profile than the THC percentage. I purchased 1/8 flower grown by Liberty / Holistic Farms from Restore in Philadelphia in early January. Bought it on a whim because, to be honest, the low THC percentage (15.5%) didn’t really ring any bells for me. But I had tried Liberty/Holistic’s Raspberry Cough and was very impressed.
