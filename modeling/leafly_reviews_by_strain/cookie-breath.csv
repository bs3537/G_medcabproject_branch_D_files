The nugs are fantastic; covered in deep, deep purples, with orange hairs and crystals shimmering all over it. I had perhaps some of the stickiest nugs I had ever felt before.The smell; that famous cookie smell found throughout GSCs family just smacks you in the face! The taste... Definitely earthy, but with a sweet undertone to it, if that makes sense. And the high... Lord! I smoked two bowls ...”"

I didn't really get the munchies but I ate a big meal before I vaped.  The bud was very dense with a  sweet earthy smell.  Could taste a wine undertone when vaped.”"

ChristopherShakur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-breath/reviews/1575389,"“This strain performed very weirdly for me. But weirdly in a good a way. It almost had a more sativa dominant effect. I had a very tingly back of the neck on up full of energy head high. But it was also a calm energy if that makes any sense lol. I surely got a lot of work and heavy thinking done while on this. A bit paranoid too lol. Very nice buds with little hints of purple and frosty carrot hairs. Had a very earthy...”"
tylerpockitt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-breath/reviews/1445373,"“The smell and taste of this bud is phenomenal... Its a sweet pungent taste and the smell is like none other. Very distinctive. The high I had was amazing. I prefer sativa breeds and this one was perfect. I didn't have extreme munchies. The high lasted long and I was extremely social and energetic unlike other strains I've had before. I slept nice, but it didn't immediately make me tired. I was ready to go run errands...”"
BuckRussell,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-breath/reviews/1789226,"“Yum!!!!

This strain is Top Shelf Perfection when grown and cured properly. 

*Effects: Very up-lifted, happy, energetic, creativity juices are flowing, feeling inspired, grateful, very relaxed breathing and body positioning. I noticed after

Bowl 1:  Just feeling very euphoric and in a light hearted and gentle mood. No anxiety whatsoever. Happy happy!

Bowl 2: The light bulbs going off. Ideas for work and music are ...”"
TrillBlvd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-breath/reviews/1683169,"“one of my top 5 fav. strains. Hairy ass purple/orange bud. Smooth hit, doesn't take much. Wish I had a few of these seeds! Bought from (now closed) Tru Releaf in Lansing, MI.”"
PhoenixWrathBCG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-breath/reviews/1722226,"“After receiving a free gram of this from a local dispensary, I decided to try it out. While I've had strains of the GSC line for a while (namely Forum Cut GSC and traditional GSC), none of them have been nearly as enjoyable of an experience. 

Appearance-
On appearance, there are lots of visible crystals on the bud, along with striking orange pistils interlaced with the darker green base.

Scent/Taste-
This strain wa...”"

Witch0fthewilds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-breath/reviews/1572995,"“I love this strain! Very euphoric for me, made me happy and got the giggles later on the more I smokes. Wasn't couch locked or devoring food. I also wanted to add that I suffer from chronic severe migraines daily, and most strains either don't take care of that at all or just add to it. But with this, all I got was dry mouth and dry eyes, it even took the edge off my migraine. I was very pleased to also discover that...”"
JakePrev00,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-breath/reviews/1767382,"“It’s a nice feeling. You don’t get wicked giggly I smoked during a bad anxiety kick and it cleared my mind and I felt happy and at ease, the come down wasn’t bad either which is a huge plus.

Negatives- it’s not as strong as most stuff but still really nice.”"

KushMasterKush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookie-breath/reviews/1593712,"“extremely frosty, great bag appeal and solid taste. I don't like to speak of the effects since cannabis in general affects us all differently. It vegs well and looks great in flower, but appears to be a low yielder. Not too much of a surprise with these genetics though. 5 stars to smoke, 4.5 stars to grow...if yields dent matter to you, then 5 stars all around!”"
