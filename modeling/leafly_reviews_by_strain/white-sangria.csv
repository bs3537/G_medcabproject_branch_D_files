zkjev01,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-sangria/reviews/1397345,"“Very clear headed, uplifting, focused type of effects. Medicating with concentrate from trichome vault extracts. I feel like I can go on with my day and not have to grab some caffeine to stay alert. I never felt drowsy and I never felt cloudy which is perfect for daytime use. I never felt the stoned sedated effects so skip the pre bedtime puff. Very low anxiety with this one and I'm very sensitive to the anxiety effe...”"

I was still able to function. It is so bright and pretty. The bud itself is sticky and very hairy and covered in crystals. It's lighter than a lime. Beautiful. Tasty. Amazing”"
elheffe702,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-sangria/reviews/1439028,"“So good. It's so smooth, in pax2, that it's almost like a cold, crisp breath of fresh air on a day, with just a hint of something, maybe citrus, in the air. I have chronic pain from a car crash a few months ago, and this really helps. Today I worked, went ice skating, and I'm currently having my own dance party with my ear buds...huh huh, totally new meaning now lol...in my recliner, tweaking my Pandora stations. I'm...”"

FlowerKittyGirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-sangria/reviews/1413585,"“I love this strain! It tastes good, provides clean white smoke, and looks great. above all, however, is the high. It's definitely a day-time pick me up.”"
hufflepuffpuffasss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-sangria/reviews/1619579,"“One of my all-time favorite strains, but only when it leans strong on the indica side. When it ends up as a hybrid, it tends to have lots of resin and makes me cough extra hard. But for some reason when its a pure indica its perfect. Just depends on the grower, as with any plant!”"
PhilWahl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-sangria/reviews/1590157,"“A nice high once there but this Weed  is very harsh, maybe grower failed to flush in last 2 weeks of flowering, hence salt and a some other chemical residue in these flowers”"
heattwave,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-sangria/reviews/1589241,"“Great for pain management after a dentist visit. Also great for creative writing and listening to music.”"
jrok203,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-sangria/reviews/1413586,"“Calm and focused. Little to no high for me. The taste wasn't great, but it was smooth. I don't normally smoke during the day, but I feel I could maintain at work on this strain. Great strain for anxiety, to relax your mind and still have energy.”"
airjoe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-sangria/reviews/1376447,"“One of the best pre rolls I've had. Taste and high is perfect.”"
Froggeth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-sangria/reviews/1469507,"“Smells extremely sweet (like a blood orange), tastes as it smells and retains its good taste down to the roach when rolled. 

Provides that hazy middleground hybrids are known for, forgot to finish my bowl after the first hit had me pretty well medicated. Leaves a pleasant aftertaste and the effects fade into full-bodied relaxation after about 2 hours.”"

P4ND4_,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-sangria/reviews/1777748,"“White Sangria hits. Reading others review on its taste I felt cheated. My experience was that it had an deep earth taste as plant material would. No fruity notes. I would  not recommend for Chronic Migraine due to IIH. Cerebrally stimulating. Paranoia. Might aggravate and contribute more to IIH symptoms. Trying to find a positive, my main purpose for using is medicinal not recreational. I would point a Migraine/IIH s...”"

I know this, I tried this and put it into the cook for edibles pile.   Later I re visited that strain. It's very cerebral and intense. I took it out of " cook"  pile..”"
