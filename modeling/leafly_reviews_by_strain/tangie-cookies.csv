Enjoying some tasty Tangie 🍊Cookies 🍪, which is a combo of two personal faves, sweet Thin Mint GSC + a savory, bitter Tangie — not necessarily a combo that appeals to me at first ponder! But she makes good sense in my bong lol, so that’s all that matters right now ;) She’s def a bold, pungent flavor that not everyone will enjoy, but her lovely euphoria, managed bac...”"

With a deep and pronounced aroma profile leaning to the powerful tangie side and boosted by the linger of cookies funk, this strain is an absolute must try. Gorgeous Ganja!!!”"
CannaBarbie420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangie-cookies/reviews/1593394,"“I’ll be honest, I usually hate sativa strains.  I suffer from anxiety, and, I always find they make my heart race and make me uncomfortable.  After smoking tangie cookie because it was so beautiful lol, I have to say this is the first full sativa I have ever smoked that I truly enjoyed.  Fun, uplifting high, great for exercise or work, without any negative, anxiety ridden feelings.  Great flavor.  Definitely big, ora...”"

Clear, pure euphoria, with a sedation that doesn't feel heavy, but won't let you get up.
Purchased through Eaze as Tangimal Cookies, by Humboldt Farms.
10/10 definitely recommended.
Grown outdoors, this flower smells and tastes fantastic.”"

ReturnToEarth,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangie-cookies/reviews/1787944,"“I was told that the strain I received was called Tangerine Cookies. Which I assumed was likely a cross of at least 2 key popular strains, Tangerine Dream & GSC. I was almost right, lol.
Anyway, the buds seem to range mostly from dime size to near ping-pong ball size, are mostly roundish in form with VERY little leaves. Just 85+% solid bud. & when I say solid, I mean very, very dense. Not quite as dense as they come, ...”"

LimeSorbet,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangie-cookies/reviews/1795912,"“Strong Sativa. Cookie taste with Tangie High. Very mental high, good for PTSD and Anxiety. Decent body high not too strong though.”"
Berrypopsix,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangie-cookies/reviews/1607881,"“This is some serious dank! Taste like an orange sugar cookie or orange biscuit cake or something similar. 
Grown by Pruf PDX. 
Some of the best weed I have had all year. From the flavor the high 5 stars - knocked out of the park! 

Don’t pass up on this one!”"

That concert was hella lit off of Tangie Cookies, also have used it at work and has totally helped me get a lot more done and be more productive. Love the euphoria that comes with this strain. Would very much recommend to people for sure!”"

Rolandg77,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangie-cookies/reviews/1703352,"“Hit this one all day and crushed the last one: pretty close to bad paranoia and anxiety (I sometimes have issues with this - probably not everyone does) then super relaxed and giggly. Pretty damn dizzy. Wouldn’t want to have to talk to anyone right now. Droopy, red eyes. Landing ended up really fun and euphoric. Hit before bed was just relaxing. Definitely sativa effects with a strong head and light body high.”"
