I'm still present, able to think clearly, but I am extremely relaxed, and also reminded of the beauty in my life: I feel grateful for so much, including this strain. Grandpa has a calming presence, and gentle wisdom. Namaste.”"

Not so with Grandpas Breath. I love the heavier leaning sedative effects, and the smoke tastes amazing. I suffer from anxiety disorder and had no issues when enjoying larger amounts.

The high is cerebral and physical, it made me want to do longer and deeper stretches. My back pain and shoulder pain reduced significantly. Good for the evening when you are winding down, want to get sexy 😂”"

This is a pretty pungent one, so newbies may not enjoy this one as much as ‘ol timers, as it’s pretty harsh on both uptake + exhale. Tastewise + terpenicly-speaking, this particular Grandpa is easy on the GDP, heavy on the OG Kush, but painful menstrual cramps quickly dissipated + my joint/muscular pain lessened tremendously—medicinally ...”"

Nugs are very frosty, not the heaviest yielder but this particular pheno was very cookies dominant. Great for consumption, above average, but below amazing to grow. Good job dvg”"

Vapescape,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grandpas-breath/reviews/1603276,"“This strain is mainly a relaxation station. This is perfect for body aches and pains! If a completely healthy person were to smoke this just for fun, it would be most effective to smoke it at night time as it most likely will put you in a comfy atmosphere.”"

It’s the ultimate chill but no couch lock unless you choose it then you will just melt into your couch with Grandpa’s Breath. Give this one a try, it’s a must!”"

The conversation turned into a competition who could say the word gushers with the accent of a dear relative. Something that no one had ever done. Then it happened. At first we all thought we were hearing things. But then it happened again. We were doing it. GuiissshhhheeeeRRrrRrSsszzzzzz.  So perfectly.
