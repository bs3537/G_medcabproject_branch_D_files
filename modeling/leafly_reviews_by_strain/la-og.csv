Lisa9,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1363212,"“Best product out of everything that I have tried for pain. And it really helps me sleep. I also seem to wak up in less pain. Other positives, I don't fight trying to hide my red eyes when I go out in the morning. I don't go to bed with hunger pains.

I use it in a tincture.”"
KushMunkee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1263502,"“Man, this is like my third or fourth hit over the course of the last couple of weeks. And wow! I love how the L.A. OG grabs your face and frees the spirit and the stress. Great head high, starting to tingle down the arms and spine. It gets into your toes making stretching said toes an absolute delight. Just fan those damn toes out and feel the universe!

Eyes feel airy and light. A little dry in the eyes and mouth....”"
kkcastillo21,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1349070,"“If you're in pain or can't sleep...try this. I suffer from insomnia and endometriosis (painful girl disease). Not even Ambien or Lunesta can help me sleep, but one bowl from this will knock me out. Pain wise, 15 mintues later I can't feel anything. This is SUPER strong though. I once smoked 3 bowls and was so high I felt paralyzed. Still my go-to Indica though.”"
g.kirk,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1393898,"“This strain is a god sent for anyone looking for a heavy hitting indica. I picked up a half oz from Sacred Seed (Med) in Denver. I had tried just about every indica they had and nothing was strong enough until they suggested I tried LA OG. The buds are a medium light green with light brown/orange hairs running through the middle of the buds. The smell is exactly like Fruity Pebbles. The smoke is my favorite part, its...”"
AndreaN,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1338021,"“This strain is by Kynd . THC - 23.57%. CBD 0.11 % ( limonene 2.10 % myrecene 0.70 % ) 
Very nice tight buds ! A great medicine - helps lull me to sleep !  
A little drier than I would like .... But that seems to be a " Nevada Problem " that some producers haven't quite gotten a grip on yet 😆😁😳..... Oh well ! 
Mix this with some Ringos Gift & I am feeling fine .......”"

Grand451,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1376077,"“A couple weeks ago I mama bed to get my hands on some la og and the first thing I decided to do when I was in the clouds was meditate. Boy o boy, I had an amazing experience; I was somewhere I've never been before and the moments of true bliss. This as well helped me alleviate pain from work and reduce my anxiety. I would recommend this to anyone who ever has trouble managing pain or just needs some fire to relax.”"
bluephoenix12,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1363213,"“Very dank stuff, long red clusters of hairs with very green leaves that only peak out barely from the ton of whitish amber crystals.  The high was strong and was prominent in my forehead and fingertips but was overall a full body and head buzz.  Also made me feel more creative, but the high was so enjoyable it was difficult to get going on anything.”"
Reno420Sparks,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1513457,"“I really enjoy this strain. Its really high in (caryophllene) like the gorilla glue #4. Works great for pain and anxiety.  Also combined with cbd for opiate withdraw. Suffer from severe anxiety and this strain doesn't give me any anxious feelings at all. A must try for anxiety, depression and PTSD.”"
BlazingSince2000,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1341910,"“Strong very potent buzz, great up lifting high that won't bring you down. I have back pain and sciatica so when I wake up in the morning take b- rip and all my pain is gone for a few hours. Will get you couch locked and you will forget about Father Time.”"
mobiuscydonia,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1150171,"“Gets to work in two big hits from a 14mm size bowl. This stuff makes you feel tickled in the abdominal muscles.. Then eventually heads North and massages your head. Then dances on your skin. And then hunger. That is the high for this also you see in waves. Pretty fucking good high. I like this better than gsc. Gsc was alot more chronic and kinda gave me a head ache. Good High thoooo. 

-Written whilst highhhh”"
broken,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1150172,"“Overall a good og strain, nice fruity, musky smell, good taste. 3 hits should be a good start, then a mellow buzz, good flower to kick back with, if you see it,  pick it up, you should enjoy it, i sure did! AZ Medical Patient.”"
OGLucas420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1263501,"“this is a great strain especially if you are looking for flavor that's close to  grapes or purple cough syrup”"
AndreaN,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1276734,"“Down to my last little flower of this , & it has actually become my go to medicine, when the other strains aren't doing the job . 

It's hard to find really awesome indica Strains- there are plenty of hybrids & sativas flooding the local dispensary market, but finding a great indica has become a challenge ! But this LA OG has been a god send lately 😊✌🏽️💤💤👌🏼”"
KushMunkee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1138978,"“I picked up a gram from MedicalHerbs4U on recommendation and currently make this my occasional vape. Wow. Massive head high with explosions of color, augmented sound and supreme giddiness. Incredibly happy/euphoric and finishes with energy. Hits right in the sinus/eyes at first, then starts moving down the body. On the plus side, this makes me horny as hell!

Nugs are dense and slightly sticky - springy when ground...”"

Very relaxing and happy high, do not use during the day though, or else you will pass the fuck out and wake up around 3 a.m. not knowing where the fuck you are lol. Very strong and sweet aroma and the bud is just coated in crystals.😋 9.5/10”"

Rushx1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1581988,"“A rare gem that any connoisseur must grab if found. However, let the smoker beware, grab the headphones or remote and do not plan on doing anything...I repeat, anything!”"
Cannasocial,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1341911,"“Best insomnia/pain cure yet. Blows away all pain and restlessness. I can turn right off and go to sleep. Really strong overall high...nighttime strain only. Easy smoke smooth throat feel.”"

Wickedbark59,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1313539,"“Not a huge fan but it was alright. Takes a lot more to get the job done than some other strains. Didn't really help with nausea but did help with pain for the most part. One thing I will say is that it seems to smoke differently depending on the form. Didn't care for it when smoking with a pipe but rolled into a joint it was alright.”"

Don_EL1T3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1624890,"“I got a few grams of shatter of this strain the other day... Honestly have to say it tastes like some lime candy I used to have when I was a kid... Overall it was a nice high, wouldn't say it was too in your face or anything more mellow than intense... A nice smoke before bed dab a few hits of this and Master OG and I'm relaxed enough to at least lay down to be able to pass out...”"

scott649,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1149515,"“It was a good buy, went in with only $45 to spend and got an 1/8 for $20 and it smells and sticks together like a mid-to-top shelf bud. Nice smell that over powered all the other strains I have. It's good stuff but only if you get it from the right place!”"

The wax came in at only a tad under 60% THC, which is a little low for concentrates...However, even small dabs are  very potent. The wax I got was from Kynd and the price was relatively good. Taste was excellent and a little sweet. Smoke was easy and mellow, using an enail at 600D F. I still enjoy flower, but con...”"

Shaylen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-og/reviews/1699568,"“First strain that gave me an actual couch lock. My eye lids, forehead, head, even tongue were tingling. Sounds odd but it was a very soothing sensation. I've yet to find a strain to calm my heart palpitations and racing thoughts when going to bed but this helps take an edge off and at least gets me some sleep. A great strain for insomnia and anxiety. I think I found the strain for me, FINALLY.”"

Took about 4 good hits to try and go to sleep, big mistake! Once I got in bed and closed my eyes my reality became a prison of infinite self referential evaluation. I literally thought I would lose my mind. For brief movements I could get a handle on reality, but only the smallest foot hold. It was like being forced to men...”"
