Arielisabella,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bio-diesel/reviews/1399230,"“Unbelievable euphoria. I am quite susceptible to these effects since my tolerance is relatively low, I recommend smoking this strain slowly and in small amounts if your tolerance is low like mine - in other words smoke blunts and joints, not buckets and bongs. Unless of course you are a regular smoker, in which case, enjoy this strain like any other but indulge in a completely unique body/head high.”"

LoriL.,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bio-diesel/reviews/1363871,"“This strain looks beautiful and sparkly and the effects are very pronounced, with pressure behind my eyes, a sure sense of focus without any couch-lock.  I should say that if I wanted to, I could either clean my house or take a nap.  The smoke itself is expansive but smooth with no harshness or overwhelming diesel taste.  I felt a definite tingly warmth starting with my face.  This would be a really good strain to sh...”"
