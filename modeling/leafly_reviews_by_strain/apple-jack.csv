mainenugs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1391969,"“I talked to my guy yesterday to put in an order and he told me he had apple jack. I looked it up and it had some pretty lack luster reviews so I was not very excited but picked it up anyway. 
He told me that there are very few people who actually have clones of this strain so I started to be more excited.
When I opened it up, it reeked of delicious sour apples. The hit was very very smoky and the nugs were insanely f...”"
Jazzlinda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1413362,"“Really potent, euphoric high. It was more intense than other strains I've tried, but not too much. I love this strain, I can see it quickly becoming a favorite.”"
vyrd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1390078,"“picked up some by dream city (grower, Seattle area, was on mid), tested at 22% thc with minimal cbd

it smells fruity and sweet, with a subtle undertone of fresh rainforest to balance it out. buds are pretty dense, this is a grind job for sure. slightly sticky and trichomes are a pale butterscotch, not quite amber gold. 

smokes pretty easy, crisp like an apple haha. unfortunately the smoke is not what I'd expect fro...”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1388061,"“I really do recommend Apple Jack if you have nausea. It works perfectly and the high is very soothing as well. It was nice to be able to think about something other than when will I get sick again.  I felt like doing some chores and later it was also perfect for watching some of my favorite shows...quite the transformation from the puking mess that I was to the functional person I soon became. Bravo!”"
Kofitii,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1437155,"“I've had both mid tier, and private reserve Apple Jack  and both of them created the same effect but at varying intensities. Its a nice light high that's easy to concentrate on. Not great if you're looking to get mega-stoned, but amazing if you need to stay focused and just feel really great.”"
vonte47,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1388063,"“Killeen Texas (corner plug)
Delicious aroma type a spell you'd want to shove up your nose to smell it forever.

Grinds with ease fluffy feel.
Relaxing smoke (rolled in a joint purely crisp) 
 
Make my eyes feel tingly and my body feel light 
Mood:happy 
Status :chilling ❄️”"
RWright,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1368924,"“I've bought Apple Jack on two separate occasions. The 1st batch was close 20pct. Thc. and the second was their highest testing flower to date at 30.6pct Thc.  I didn't find much relief out of the first batch but was impressed with taste and smell.  I do have a higher tolerance so was willing to give another try when released at 30pct.  The buds had amazing butterscotch tones to it and to me it had a nice mild smell o...”"
Timbaroo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1536386,"“Great daytime strain. I recently got back into smoking after a two month tolerance break and have been smoking indica or hybrids to build up my tolerance (when you’re high and spell it tokerance). Finally I was in the right spot to try Apple Jack. Spent ten minutes smoking a bowl through a spoon pipe. I was trying to pace myself bc sativa, but I wasn’t being a baby about it bc the buds looked pretty mid. But wow it h...”"

Jugg4lo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1767374,"“Taste & Smells like a fresh box of applejacks! Takes you back to being a kid. Smoke some flowers & see if you don't want a glass of milk! Haha
Not just cinnamon & apples. Straight Applejack's!”"
Bernscachu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1536011,"“This was my first buy. I picked it up for a preworkout. I have to say I enjoyed it. The workout was great I was really able to get a good muscle and mind focus. A good amount of energy but I did feel that anxious and paranoid feeling but nothing too crazy.”"
gjgraheezy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1372021,"“instantly fell in love with this strain. I'm a big jack herer fan, and Apple Jack gives me that clear headed happy high and adds a great body and positive vibe high. my go-to for a good wake n bake. amazing aroma and flavor to match. it even helps with my morning nausea that I occasionally suffer from. nothing but good things to say about this little guy. a must try if it's good quality”"
Dieann63,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1769700,"“Apple Jack is not just for breakfast!!!
Smooth in the bong...tastes really good!
Tastes of Apples and mother nature.
I feel like this strain has a way of waking me up! I'm buzzed, but not falling asleep. Motivated to get things done, nice pain numbing experience for me too!
I skipped my nightly methadone pill for pain and slept thru till 5am in need of pain meds. Normally take above and percocet at bedtime to be able...”"
AZHerbExpert,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1583177,"“Looks: Chunky lime green buds with small orange hairs, covered in a light layer of trichomes with small glandular heads.  Smell:  Very tropical/ apple fruity/ limey like Jack Herer.  Taste:  Very much like the smell.  Like fresh green apples and lime, with a little pine on the finish.  Effects:  Very mellow, and cerebral without couchlock effects.  Great day time strain.”"

MamasitaMichelle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1453365,"“Surprisingly potent, felt kind of like a cup of coffee-- a little buzzy, almost verging on anxious at some points but never quite tipping there. Though, it made me feel laser focused on things at times, which could be a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it.”"
Ksilva,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1390297,"“I got a sativa called Apple Jacks so I guess this is it. This didn't do anything for me man. No wonder it's so unpopular on here”"
HikingWalrus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1638918,"“Released feeling of anxiety and tension for me, it was so uplifting for me that the effects made me feel clearer in the head. All in all just a energetic hybrid”"
KingSativas83,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1509079,"“Love this Strain. Definately a strain For growers of all levels, difficulty easy-medium. I found it to be a very high yielding hybrid pheno with aromatic flavours. Would recommend try atleast once.”"
inkedangie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1467403,"“I liked it the first time I smoked it. I felt happy, giggly, & relaxed. The second time I felt super anxious and paranoid. I tossed and turned for 10 hours and was high for almost 12. It's different with everyone, but I wouldn't buy it again. I'll stick to indica instead.”"

mtchyg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1460302,"“Wow. For starters, the scent is about as close to fresh cut apples as any cannabis has any business to be. The flavor is an earthy sweet apple flavor. And stays that way for a while using the vape. 

Very happy (and delicious) strain. Relaxing.”"

Atomc1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1618464,"“I have found this strain to be great for daytime use, giving crisp mental elevation, and  what I describe as “cleaning up the body feel” without slowing my physical performance down. The effects seem to be long lasting and strong, and its taste is just as powerful with the Jack really coming through having an infused hint of green apple. It is fresh and tasty indeed. Keep your eye out for this one and get some when s...”"
Anonymous416,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1802692,"“This is a good strain for daytime use. I have anxiety and this keeps me well distracted from it. Effects last about a good hour & a half. I’d say it’s more sativa dominate cuz i don’t get sleepy.  Overall a good 7/10.”"
JungleFalcon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1572032,"“Tried it dealing with my panic disorder/agoraphobia/anxiety. It keeps you happy and energetic for the most part. It says a negative is that it causes anxiousness but I didn't experience any at all. Awesome strain for sure. Good for day time”"
Nooper,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-jack/reviews/1632485,"“This is a super speedy strain, great for working out or productivity in general.

Won’t let you sit on the couch, let alone lock you there.

I found it a little too skinny to notice the apple much... but it does what it does very well.”"
