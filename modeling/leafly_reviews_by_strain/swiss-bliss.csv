It looked outstanding and very very dank, I took a whole bong hit and could feel it's medicating effects almost instantly. The high is amazing. It started at the back of my head making its way to the center of my chest then proceeded throughout the rest ...”"

(I work from home)  I could smoke this all day. Day being the keyword.  I cannot sleep at night when smoking this.  I suggest an Indica as well to balance this out.”"

I just remember that you could stick it to the wall and it would stay put, for a couple seconds at least.  The buds were always well manicured, fragrant, and bristling with white crystals.

Great with movies, hanging with friends, and even that simple but needed alone time with your friends the electronic entertainers.”"

I think it's a creeper,  too, so watch out. In short, take it slow at first. positives are that it makes you laugh at shit and does get you super high on less smoke.”"
Krystalmyth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/swiss-bliss/reviews/1727097,"“Absolutely delicious strain. Vaping a fresh 95% THC Distillate and the flavor is just so... crisp. I can taste the earthy citrus, and it just makes me smile every time I take a hit. I'm surprised by all these 4 star reviews. This is a very bright and creative hybrid that is so sativa in its nature it might as well be considered one fully. I feel joyful, playful, talkative. I was glowing coming home after trying this ...”"

josephzorzoli,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/swiss-bliss/reviews/1283671,"“Great strain... I would describe the taste as kinda earthy, but I can also taste a sweetness to it. Very euphoric high. Great for watching TV or just taking a nap. Although I had a small headache...  Not sure if it was the strain or just the fact I was kind of hungry before I smoked.”"
