JustinKCHC,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-jack/reviews/1397457,"“Great sativa dominant strain for indica lovers. Definitely a favorite hybrid. Ups the appetite as well.”"
blazethenugs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-jack/reviews/1363409,"“Jack Herer X DJ Short Blueberry.  This is truly one special strain. Blueburrry Jack I got it on with was 20.03%thc, 20.4%CBD. Pretty amazing numbers, rare to have 20%CBD alone, very rare to have +20% on both.

Listen, the stank-so-good, irresistible, piney smell of Jack Herer with the fruity berry aroma from Dj Short Blueberry mesh seemlessly.

A subtly sweet, piney, dominatently Blueberry flavor, my taste buds were ...”"
doogie.houge,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-jack/reviews/1360283,"“The cut I got of this, probably had the highest THC content of any cannabis I've ever tried. They call it "Blueberry" Jack, but the emphasis is "Jack" as it has the best traits of that mythical strain. At first glance, it's pure Jack Herer. But closer inspection shows densely packed buds, just saturated in brown trichrome strands. The aroma is fruity and sexy, the taste is mildly spicy. The last thing you'll taste th...”"
samb716,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-jack/reviews/1410913,"“Bought a gram at AZ Natural Selections of Scottsdale. Incredibly sweet smelling and dark green buds with a piney undertone, very frosty with keef and a dense cone structure. Taste is much more piney than the smell, but still very sweet. High is very heady, incredibly clear and high energy. A nice sativa undertone keeps you from feeling any anxiety. Great for enjoying any activity, would definitely buy more than a gra...”"
HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-jack/reviews/1355188,"“Bottom line concerning this strain is there is not enough of that classic sativa high for my preferences. May work well for those with social anxiety, because of its clear heady high and not much angst throughout the dosing. I gave this strain 4 stars because of the presentation; one of the best smelling strains out there.”"

serinity0087,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-jack/reviews/1261050,"“Excellent any time of the day strain. First of the bud structure was dense, large, pointy buds. So the Jack makes himself known even in appearance. DJ shorts Blueberry shows in the large roundness of the buds and the immediate smell & taste. 2 great strains paired nicely. Essentially I'm a Indica smoker but will try to always keep some of this around and make sure to grab it up when it's around. High thc & cbd which ...”"

Absorbing stuff and engaging with people is constantly intriguing and fun! Power of the high is a bit challenging, but fun for those with experience. It’s got a light, easy going view on life, but there is potential for edginess (thanks, Jack). Not much physical relaxation - in fact, the opposite - feel a bi...”"

You feel relaxed but productive at the same time. Subtle on both ends so it’s an equal mix that blends almost perfectly. I only gave it 4 stars because it did make me feel spaced out off and on. Definitely recommend staying home and being productive there!”"
