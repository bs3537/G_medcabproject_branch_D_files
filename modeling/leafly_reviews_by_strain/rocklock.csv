PowRider,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1414192,"“So I'm usually a sativa fan who only uses Indica strains on the rare occasions when I need help sleeping. I picked this strain up from my ld when I asked the bud tender to recommend a energetic hybrid. Let me say "wow". This bud is awesome if you need to get things done while enjoying a balanced head and body high. I found that if you add one or two more hits than normal you get an incredible pulsing from head to toe...”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1580803,"“Herr comes the BOOM ready or not.
I picked up a half gram of Rocklock by Venom Extracts.
It's the perfect indica for chillin, there's no sedation.
The feeling is slight and my first go around with this strain was flower. Now that I have it in shatter the feeling comes out strong.

Also great for relieving depression I have just buried someone close to me & haven't been able to snap out of heavy mourning. Now I feel a...”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1540244,"“Unique indica. I would recommend Rocklock for nights you want complete relaxation without falling asleep shortly after medicating.
Rocklock would be perfect for going to concerts or a night on the town.”"

incognito2963,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1378456,"“Nothing but great things to say about this strain. Nice chill feeling with a little bit of couch lock; Not completely, but enough. I tried to watch Jeopardy and that wasn't happening, so this is not a strain to go to class on! Over all one of the best medications for me to date.”"

Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1246896,"“Just like it's name says Rocklock very dense buds so heavily structured nock on wood toughness. It smells of fresh citrus and pungent.
It tastes like herbal not dense skunk, or earth like just put it tastes like a nice herbal Lavander thats sweet, although not bitter :p.
The effects creep on to the body slowly like you're being given a hug. The eyes creep in after and relaxes the muscles in your body, rather than ten...”"
medloveto,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1378460,"“Really liking this strain, nice pain relief and relaxing effects without the couch lock. Great day time meds that still pack a potent punch. Very tasty and smells like berries.”"

MrMedi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1148694,"“rocklock is an excellent strain aesthetics wise. it's got large, sense buds with an insane amount of light orange hairs. large amber trichomes cover the buds,and there is even purple chunks of bud on some examples. the flavour is mild, however very sweet.”"

WeatheredOne,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1475404,"“I bought this for the indica affect.  I thought "couch lock" when reading the name Rocklock.  First thing I noticed was the smooth clean draw and fruity taste.  I'd say Juicy Fruit gum is the flavor.  I bought a  1 gram pre-roll.  I smoked about 1/4 of it before it finally hit.  Tube says 19.71 THCA .20 THC.  Only a head high cant feel the body high.  I ended up smoking 3/4 of it and still wide awake and wanting to s...”"

So, score! Also, in a really cool treat - it's removing my anxiety a fair bit. Like, the super loud intrusive thought anxiety stuff I've had going for the past 3 days is gone but I'm not any sleepier than I was before I started smoking, so that's super cool. I really like this one for the whole ...”"

schuffy88,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1162189,"“This indica-heavy hybrid smokes incredibly smooth, with a pleasantly sweet boquet of lemon-lime and a hint of fresh berries, they should call this one 7-up it's so bubbly and refreshing. It will knock you out but not before you treat yourself to the finest munchies. Trouble sleeping or getting rest? Get a hold of this.”"

BOS6,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1278860,"“the reason fr my three star rating is just simply the taste the grower did not flush properly and its sucks because the bud itself is beautiful light green with vibrant orange hairs very dense and crystal coated had a sweet perfume like smell but i could still taste the nutes”"

TwistedRose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1657516,"“Up front she’s a numbly indica, sliding into your nerves and turning them to rubber bands, but when she reaches your head you might start to think thinky thoughts. You might get creative but creating is hard work with this much couch-lock, so maybe just some tv and drawing. You might need snacks for the comedown.”"

But I have tried a few that have been whoa, no munchies, no couch lock, just knock my ass out, no weed hang over the next day and a bit of energy to start the day. I got this at The Healing Touch in Encino. I had a mostly good experience with them but I purchased this strain from them, Soma Rosa Farms. The flower was dry, it was packaged in ...”"

tunzo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1184671,"“This strain was an overall good bake nice and heavy for my pain but not too cerebral so I was clear headed”"
PinkieParker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1287142,"“I got an immediate head high as a rush for like 10 seconds that smoothed out into a nice, lasting, mellow, best of both worlds high. The munchies set in fast but didn't seem to kill my high very much. All in all its a good strain that helps relax the body as well as stimulate the mind. The smell is very pungent and diesely and the taste was pungent and also slightly fruity. Very good growing and curing.”"

sidewalkstonergirl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1388846,"“I wanted an indica-dom strain to help me sleep (#homebuyerlife, compounded by some other factors), but am finding this gem is actually chill and helping me get in my head just enough to stay focused on what matters but chill enough to not care. Munchie status 3000 but who cares;
tastes great and like McDonald's says, I'm lovin' it.”"

Astro_Jay,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1471638,"“I think the strain is strong, solid, tasty, and cerebral. However, I must say that of the two strains it is hybridized from, i.e., Warlock and Rockstar, I did not like either of them as stand alones but they work well in creating Rock Lock.

I became very talkitive and enjoyed relaying information about astrology during my time with the Rock House strain. I was able to think and speak very clearly and was happy too. ...”"

Torontoker420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rocklock/reviews/1263166,"“One of my personal favorites that im glad I got to try.
Ive since found out that this is in fact an indica but it does smoke and produce more sativa effects.
ive notified the club of it being mislabelled as a sat.
 Great uplifting motivational stress for numbing pain while making you want to get up and do stuff!”"
