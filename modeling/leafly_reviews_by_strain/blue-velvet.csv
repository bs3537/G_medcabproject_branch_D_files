I can't seem to get high enough with this flower, but... not too bad TBH. Would buy again, but full disclosure; I've never NOT said that.”"

It heightens your senses, you can hear better and food tastes better. It makes me giggle at everything. The best part is it smells and tastes like blueberry muffins. And its easy to smoke. I can inhale and hold it in until almost no smoke comes out, with no coughing. I have nothing bad to say about this strain. Most strains give me headaches and thi...”"

I was sitting on the toilet contemplating life and things i did in the past it was so intense. Then continued to sit down and hold onto the toilet for dear life. Left the trap then knocked out in my bed. 11/10”"

Good for night walks, music listening and Sunday chill.”"

Never in my life had I used this word until popping open a bottle of this stuff, and now I feel that is the only word that really does it justice. The berry sweet smells and tastes amazing and I love the high. Very chill, no anxiety whatsoever (which hybrids tend to stir up in my body) and very smooth smoke. I do have to dock one star because it's taken more hits of th...”"
trenchdweller,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-velvet/reviews/1698669,"“After smoking the rest of my bag I have came to the conclusion that this is the worst hybrid i have ever came across. 
Super weak, and shitty taste, also must say that the high is barely there... fuck this strain, wouldnt sell this to my worst enemy.”"
Deez23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-velvet/reviews/1212348,"“this strain is def.. new to me and ive never heard of it.......when i heard of it thought it would be some low grade bs because of chocolate thai's characteristics but this surprised me. I love the way it smelled and smoked. It does have a bit of a coffee aftertaste to it too.”"

bluesychick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-velvet/reviews/1513738,"“True to its definition, a very balanced hybrid. Chilled out without being spacey. Great intermediate strain.”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-velvet/reviews/1256393,"“A high that’s hard to put your finger on. It’s elusive as you’re trying to think about it. Or...that says something of the cognitive abilities it evokes. Mostly a soft and cloudy head space that makes it a struggle to think. You’ll want to just relax and engage with something. It’s got a gentle, rosy disposition that’s pleasant and smiley. Though, it’s pretty low-key and physically draining. A more peaceful high with...”"

LEQCANNASOINS,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-velvet/reviews/1411656,"“A not half bad strain for mornings for me from Dutch Seed Passion the mix of Oaxaca Gold x Chocolate Tallahassee fits my Chocolate craving mornings already spicy enough from the Dagoba Xocolat with chilies and dark cacao I have every morning as a great Wake and Bake aid.

This fun strain is very productive for this guy !  Almost euphorical in nature.”"
shyland,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-velvet/reviews/1377196,"“Blue Velvet, aka Blueberry is a harsher strain when smoked. As soon as it hit the back of my throat I was coughing and couldn't stop. I bought this in a larger quantity and discovered that after smoking about a 1/8  oz I had an irritated throat for days afterwards. If you aren't sensitive to this strain like I am, it's a great pick for a long lasting head high with relief to headaches and depression.”"
