DarthCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/matanuska-thunder-fuck/reviews/1412438,"“Genetics: Haze x Northern Lights x Skunk x Highland Oaxacan Gold

Looks: Absolutely beautiful.  Light green with some of the most amazing pistils I’ve ever seen.  Hairs are long, mustard/creamsicle colored, and upon further review through a microscope, decked out with amber trichs.  Sugary as all hell, a gorgeous representation of the strain.

Smell: Skunk comes through heavy in the smell, lots of Haze notes too....”"
