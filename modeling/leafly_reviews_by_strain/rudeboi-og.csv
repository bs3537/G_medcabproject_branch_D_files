RudeBoi OG
=============
blaqhippiejesus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rudeboi-og/reviews/1390511,"“I think this strain is a misnomer; it should be called Energizer Bunny. Rude Boi is a super energizing and engaging strain.  Its uplifting vibe put a smile on my face as I laced up my running shoes and took the dogs for a moonlit run.  Listening to the dance grooves of Daft Punk, Rude Boi had me floating. I'd say this strain is the perfect accompaniment to staying moving while getting lifted.  Great for going for a r...”"
Herbalmagician,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rudeboi-og/reviews/1390512,"“Legit, top-shelf, 5 star, conoissuer's weed. Mine was grown by the ever-awesome Resin Ranchers here in Oregon, clocking in at  just shy of 25% THC. The most notable aspect of this strain (to me) is the incredibly dank, savory, nutty/pine/citrus one-of-a-kind flavor that lingers on the palate long after the exhale. The effects are potent and well balanced between head and body, suitable for a wide range of activities/...”"
Remedy394,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rudeboi-og/reviews/1526160,"“I purchased the strain because I liked the genetics and smell (the nose knows, I'm telling ya). At 29.72% thc, this rudeboi hit hard. I use medically daily. My tolerance is high. This lovely bud calmed the nerve pain (hard for me to find flower that does that like this), crushed all anxiety caused by my autonomic disorder, and eased my nausea to boot. It tastes and smells good and has an almost narcotic-like, stony c...”"
CBDizzly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rudeboi-og/reviews/1356366,"“RudeBoi OG is the best OG.

Massive heady buzzy uplift and almost opiate like body load within a minute of first dose. Long lasting high impact medicine. Probably not recommendable for novices or accomplishing complex tasks.”"

skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rudeboi-og/reviews/1316049,"“Wow. I'm smoking Resin Ranchers Rude Boi and it blew my face right off. I picked up one gram to try it out, and I'm a heavy smoker... two bowls and we were zoned out, in our own little worlds... it was very nice. I can see why this would be a five star strain for many. In my personal opinion, I think the quality of the product, and not the strain itself, is what makes this such a mind altering, relaxing, trance like ...”"

lotega,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rudeboi-og/reviews/1626529,"“This is a great strain. Really well balanced head and body effects. The high is happy, silly, and spacey, with little to no couch lock. However, if you need to at lower doses you can push through the spaciness and think through complex things. After the head high spaces me out it makes my whole body tingle and loosen up (the pain killing isn't as strong as some though). A warning though -- even at the 22% my Gold Lea...”"

The effects are absolutely incredible... definitely Indica dominant, but also provides a peaceful, happy head high. It's the perfect strain for relaxing after a long day because it soothes all of your little aches and pains, as well as melting your stress away.

The flower itself was very dense and light covered with crystals. The taste is VERY earthy, piney, skunky, diesely, etc., just an overall very robust flavor that I forget about every time I start a smoke sesh without preparing my throat/ lungs and regret it afterwards for a few minutes.

There is no harshness to it when smoked. However, I hate the taste. It is strong and lingering. I usually do not seek this strain out but if there is no other strain I want I will pick this one up because the high is great and that is why I gave it four stars.”"
Aspire,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rudeboi-og/reviews/1633326,"“This is an interesting strain and gives kind of a harsh one in my experience. I'm awake as hell and living it by binge watching shows on Netflix. 5/5 for me.”"

Knocks me out with the force of a freight train. Of course it is stimulating a bit at first, like you get with most strains, but it pretty quickly turns into complete pain and insomnia relief. Never fails to knock me out....”"

However, I've experienced plenty of uplift and energy.  I watched a documentary VERY interested.  It's almost like half bud, half opiate.  Strong headiness/cerebral, body high but with clarity.  Some giddiness.  It doesn't give me the munchies too much, which for me is a good thing.”"

I bought 7g because it smelled amazing. Rudeboi OG has a beautiful aroma that is floral, piney, and spicey. I normally prefer smoking my water pipe, but the flavor is really wonderful out of my bowl. As indicas go, many people agree that it’s a more uplifting and motivating strain; my personal experience confirms this, as I totally rearranged my house.”"
