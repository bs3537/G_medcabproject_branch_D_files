I must give a warning though, white widow and pink mango made me extremely horny. I was on a different level of arousal. Lucky for me I am married and my husband really enjoyed this!! Lol”"

If I'm not working on a project I can just relax. Always have great restful sleep with vivid dreams also.  Doesn't have an automatic effect like making you hungry or not hungry... sleepy or not sleepy. Just kind of depends on the day.”"

Great for talking to other people while high,  while keeping relaxed.
Doesn't taste so good, but smells great. Has a sweet-like aroma.”"
