I traded a buddy of mine traded some Strawberry Cough and Sour Alien for some Berry White and Jillybean.  I'll review the Jillybean once we try it but since the wife and I tried this first...
I do know where this strain gets its name, but it definitely has all the soulful Barry undertones.  Smooth, relaxing and just like a Barry White playlist, it had both the wife and I ...‚Äù"

ajr819,https://www.leafly.com/indica/berry-white/reviews/1318248,"‚ÄúI have already reviewed this, but after a week of habitual use, I have a bit to add. 

I smoke marijuana for medicinal properties. As a result, I have an extremely high tolerance for THC and typically do not ever get to feel the high that I used to get when first starting out. There is a secret to Berry White that I must share. 

First and foremost, use a grinder with Berry White. The reason is because there are so m...‚Äù"

I smoke maybe 2-3 times a week, but when I do smoke, one of its parent plants, white widow is my go-to. It only takes one hit and I'm good for 4-5 hours. Generally I game after I smoke, but berry white makes it damn near impossible. This will be my bed time strain for sure.  This stuff is a lot more den...‚Äù"

LorDoza,https://www.leafly.com/indica/berry-white/reviews/1365473,"‚ÄúStrong, pungent lemonade smell when ground up. Smoke is fair on the throat. A sweet, floral taste that is very mild. A bit of a zest to it though. Immediate head high and stoned feeling. A nice indica that places it's Blueberry parents' quality flavor  directly on your palate. A very vibrant strain. Overall 4.5/5 in my books‚Äù"
potprincess2000,https://www.leafly.com/indica/berry-white/reviews/1319169,"‚ÄúBerry White has become one of my favorites. The flowers have a sugary cookie and berry scent. Very rosey, earthy and rich. The taste is very fresh however it can be a bit nauseatingly sweet with heavy pills. The Blueberry and White Widow genetics make this a very  STRONG strain. It has an almost immediate effect with intense muscle relaxation and a very pleasant heaviness. This medicine is deeply mellowing and relaxi...‚Äù"

It smokes super easy...the Berry White.  Like smoking a fine mist of air, with a piney aroma and taste.  Easiest I have ever smoked.‚Äù"
