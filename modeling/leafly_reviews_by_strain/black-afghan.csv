FireMarshallBill,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-afghan/reviews/1630308,"“One of the strongest, heavy-handed, euphoric strains I've encountered, even as a Cali native. Usually grown in boutique batches and a descendent of Sensi Seeds and their white label subsidiary, it is a hybrid with the infamous Black Domina and hard to find Afghan Kush - the most resinous of all afghani landraces. Acquired from a celebrated grower in San Diego with a documented lab reports showing THC levels above 26 ...”"

Each strain having different effects. Black afghan just gave me the complete "Fuck that" feeling. Whenever I smoke Black Afghan I get way too lazy. I don't recommend smoking black afghan before class, as you will not be able to do anything in class. Anyhow it is one of the best strains that I have ever smoke...”"

The gram I picked up had 23% thc.

I vaped this at 365 degrees. The effects are a heavily sedated body high. At first, my mind is mush and I feel kind of disoriented.  There is a mild euphoria. My second go around with this strain gave me slight paranoia until the high peaked. I felt like this is a pretty social strain if you are...”"

Had a nice vape sesh of this and it has a nice afghani smoothness with a dark dirty aftetone (smooth taste/dirt after taste meh). However this is a solid hitting indica, when I think of black afghani I think about falling asleep. This is definitely a later evening strain or a deep relaxer if that’s what you are looking for. I would really recommend this as a solid indica with true indica effects tha...”"
