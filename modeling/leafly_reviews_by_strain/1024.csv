I was hesitant on buying this Strain because of the price, but a deal happened, and jumped at it.

I'm a Sativa guy and nit picky about a lot of strains.......but......Holy Shit! 

Very potent, hits fast and very easy on the lungs (Flower) during inhale/exhale. Not much of a aftertaste.

Method:Bong 2ft (2 hits) 
Starts off very focused and and uplifting with insane focus. Probably the best I'v...”"

jatb1975,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/1024/reviews/1430673,"“For me, the best results came from hitting this flower out of a bong. I ground up just enough for a nice bowl, and sprinkled the kief right on top of the bowl. The effects were almost immediate, and lasted a little for a good while. It made me super focused and driven. I wanted to keep moving and doing tasks. I was pretty much oblivious to everything around.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/1024/reviews/1518138,"“Wow the herbal musky taste and the smell similar to incense I spot on. Definite uplifting sativa effects. A little short lasting but overall a pretty decent strain. The biggest reason to try this strain would be the aroma/taste, not the high.”"
Dread80,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/1024/reviews/1351717,"“Wow! this is a REALLY great strain and super potent.

Really nice pine/sage and hits nice.... Easy on the lungs, "taking 2 ft bong hits".


Starts with a lot of energy and creeps into a very stoney head high with total relaxation but still enough to be up in at em.  
A weekend strain for sure...

Joint pain turns to warm tingles.
Zero paranoia, and and you will either be focused on one thing or zone....
Definitely wi...”"

TNpain,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/1024/reviews/1603546,"“Love this. It helps with my MS muscle spasms and my nerve pain from Trigeminal Neuralgia. It definitely gives me a boost of energy.  I use a Kandy Pen for my dry herb so I don’t think I get the actual aroma or true taste of it all.”"
StoopidPigeon,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/1024/reviews/1597835,"“Hands down this is the best Sativa I’ve ever tried. Of course it’ll vary betwixt users, but this one is best for me. I would recommend this to anyone. It instantly washes away stress and anxiety which lead to a lot of conversation. If ya know me, I’m the quiet type so a lengthy conversation rarely involves me, unless it’s Cannabis, music, art, or  Cannabis...😏”"
