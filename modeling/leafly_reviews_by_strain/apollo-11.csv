Sjburke25,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apollo-11/reviews/1166692,"“Overwhelming pungent aroma that fills the nasal cavity with a deep sour cheese taste.

symbol9991,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apollo-11/reviews/1174077,"“I love this strain.  It takes you on a cosmic journey while leaving you grounded on planet earth.  The high is soft and noninvasive but very very powerful.  This is a very potent strain.  You want to laugh, and talk, and party, and just have fun.  Even if you are having a bad day the Apollos (11 &13) will elevate your mood almost instantaneously.  Proving the weed really is a poor man's prozac:-)”"
