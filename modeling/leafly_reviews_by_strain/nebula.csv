Nebula
=============
Audio_Geek,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1392377,"“Probably one of my favourite strains of all time. 
It lifts any depression, stress, or worry you may have at the time -- I've felt quite relieved on several occasions.  It's also quite nice if you are introverted like me and find it uncomfortable to get a conversation started at a social event. 

The attributes of the strain:
Quite nice for creativity.  I've dicked around and made various types of music on this strai...”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1393408,"“I must say this is one of the better strains that I have ever tried. It goes well with good BEER.  Alternating sips of my fav lager beer and pipe hits as I type this. The flavors compliment each other and the buzz can't be beat.  Dreamy!”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1416662,"“Nebula gave me extremely strong clairvoyance and clarity. All the background thoughts ("noise" if you will) disappeared.
The single, cohesive thoughts are difficult to steer but the focus is extremely strong.
My favourite strain so far, a must try for the cannabis connoisseur.”"
macintyre,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1354528,"“Extremely potent strain. The high THC content gives an immediate head high. Very little negatives, just happy very heavy high. DO NOT smoke before having to do anything important. Helped pain and depression almost immediately and lasted for over an hour.”"
BCboii16,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1150670,"“If you plan to smoke this strain make sure you're in an area where you can sleep because this is such strong indica, I smoked .5 in one cheep and I was absolutely destroyed, you literally don't feel normal at all. Honestly can't explain, very intense high”"

magichabits,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1066860,"“Nebula is a top strain for the effects I'm after - powerful, clear head high plus an uplifting body sensation, lasts a good length of time. Extreme eye-reddener. Conversation can be a challenge due to frequent space outs.”"
IandI,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1415751,"“Nebula had me talking, euphoric and excited at warp speeds. Good conversational weed and fairly long lasting.

It worked exceptionally, the taste is very mild and the flowers are absolutely drenched in trichomes.

You'll have the best conversations with people as you're more mentally present and less far gone. You'll be In harmony with the moment.

DavidWard,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1195551,"“This is my all-time favorite. It gives a medium strength, soft buzz that has the effect of imparting relaxed focus. Great for...well...everything! I use it to help me focus with work, exercise, and study. It also helps with deepening the experience of de-stressing. Top notch strain all around. Also seems to combine really well when smoked alongside sativa strains.”"

Great for depression or anxiety. When you break up the buds you get a very pleasant  smell of honey with a slight bit of peanut. Taste is pretty much the same. I would buy this strain again. Would recommend after a long day at work or if you're just feeling down.”"

cascadianmass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1238567,"“Nebula will send you to the stars! This incredibly potent flower is very aromatic and smells like stardust! It kinda tastes like stardust as well, due to the high amount of crystals and trichomes. Can be blue, red, and green with orangish hairs, and as you crack open the exceptionally fluffy buds, you may just notice a star begin to form.”"
CanyonRunner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1394394,"“This is hands down my favorite strain I have ever tasted and experienced. It deserves far more attention.

THC: ~70%
Taste 5/5 HONEY!! Really does taste like honey on the exhale along with earthy undertones.
High: 5/5 PARC Dispensary had this strain mislabeled as indica dominant I saved it for right before bed. It definitely has psychedelic properties. It wasn't so much hallucinogenic, but that almost mind numbing high? Really great for meditation.”"
dreadp,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1066856,"“Definitely a hard-hitting sativa, especially if you've got a premium sample on your hands. I found it has more of an 'edge' than Jack Herer. This has given me bouts of panic/anxiety if I smoke too much on the first touch from being sober, so handle it gently. The high is strong, crisp and 'tingly'. Also, make sure you have some water around, as the dry mouth and eyes can be intense man! Buckle up!

Redshift187,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1291045,"“Very smooth flavour, quite strong.  At first it gives a lot of energy, almost bouncing off the walls.  After an hour or so it settles down to a very euphoric buzz.  One of the most enjoyable weeds I've ever tried.”"

FadedKush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1318240,"“I can definitely give this strain an A+ and say it's a must try. Smells delightful and has an overall good stone as long as you don't over do it. I had one too many bong hoots and ended up seeing tracers, my legs felt literally like jello and I was hearing my thoughts in slow motion 😂 I slept it off. Non the less a beautiful strain indeed!”"

dke783,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1373988,"“This is an excellent strain for a dreamy, thoughtful, and pleasantly uplifting experience. No paranoia or cognitive impairment, just a mentally-active and physically pleasant buzz. Ideal for a solitary afternoon doing chores, reading, walking the dog, doing cardio on the treadmill. I haven't been around people while on Nebula, but I think it might be a good social enhancer, too. If you want a pleasant uplift without ...”"

So, I bought the Nebula-2 (not listed here) and my results were nada. This did absolutely nothing for me. So maybe I was a little too cautious with my strain selection. And I also think that maybe, the fact th...”"

HappilyPainFree,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1385934,"“Nice, pungent, sweet smell upon opening the bag. Vaping it gives the best flavour appreciation. - flowery, honey and earthy  at the same time.  I find this strain very calming and euphoric - it gives a new dimension to music! 

Mild body high, relaxation of muscles. No dizziness, just a mellow creep-in-slowly blanket of happy descending on your mind. 

Puts me in a creative mood for deep thoughts and deep reading. Do...”"
Newhampshires,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula/reviews/1385933,"“Pretty good. Rated 7.9-8.2 out of 10. Grinds excellently, sweet taste. For me, some nugs got me stoned and others not so much. Idk, maybe that was a 'me problem' though.”"

SWIM ate a brownie and within 30 minutes began to feel relaxed (anti-stress). Music sounds amazing with this strain! SWIM just kept headphones on. Listen to electronic, Erykah Baduh, w.e. you want. It's absolutely beautiful. SWIM typically ends up playing Zombies and let me tell you, it's a trip, 4x more difficult but the experience is awesome! SWIM has also taken some pictures while ...”"
