Master Kush
=============
MindTrigger,https://www.leafly.com/indica/master-kush/reviews/1415812,"“This is my default strain lately.  It has a very potent but level effect from start to finish, and just tends to take the edge off of things enough so I can relax, enjoy, but still focus on whatever I am doing at the time. I am a casual smoker, so usually it's the weekend and I am doing things around the house, yard work, etc. I also like this one when I am going to hang out at a bar with friends because it allows me...”"

Romptoast,https://www.leafly.com/indica/master-kush/reviews/1413389,"“One of the most powerful strains I've ever smoked. Being that it has kush in the name, I thought it was going to be a strong body high, and it was, but it was also quite psychedelic. When smoked in small amounts, it's good for pain and munchies, and is a relatively social strain, however, if used in excess, I would seriously stay the hell inside.. Not only does it numb your entire body, but definitely alters your per...”"

The best part about this weed was that it was super strong, but more or less made me slow down and lose concentration.

It's one of the first strains I ever tried out of a dispensary and I always try to pick some up whenever I can find it. Master Kush is my go-to sleepytime strain because it helps me relax and makes my anxiety ease up long enough to fall asleep, plus I actually stay asleep longer I've noticed. Buds are always really pretty and can't get enough of the smell either!”"
