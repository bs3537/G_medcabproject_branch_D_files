John18,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cosmic-collision/reviews/1657815,"“My dispensary sold me a 1/2 ounce of Cosmic Og, which was described exactly like the leafy overview...but was sold as an Indica, not a Sativa!

I am going to give you this “old-timer’s” thoughts on just what we’ve got here:

Bud structure: very much Indica in nature; stout and firm.

Effect: it’s 1:56 pm, PST, Friday afternoon. What a plea...”"
MitchellandFinese,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cosmic-collision/reviews/1512166,"“After a long day of work this was the perfect bud to smoke the day away with. Perfect to help rejuvenate or even get the day started if it’s off to a bad start.”"
Ankush22,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cosmic-collision/reviews/1410927,"“A great energetic strain that is recommended before an activity.  A sweet armona and flavourful that will have you wanting more”"
