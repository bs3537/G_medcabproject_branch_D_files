Makes you super fucking happy, it's almost impossible not to be in an extremely good mood, even in the midst of Armageddon, this strain does not compromise”"
janet47,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-sour-skunk/reviews/1377165,"“Amazing sativa. Gives you the perfect uplifting high and doesn't stop you from continuing your day. Hardly made me feel sleepy or groggy after my high went down so its a perfect morning/day time strain. Smell is light and earthy, similar to the taste.”"
AshChristina,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-sour-skunk/reviews/1377167,"“Probably one of the funniest highs I've had. Incredibly potent, and while its a bit short lasting it does tend to come in waves.”"

Looks: Bright green,slightly leafy bud with nice trich coverage, red hairs poke out much like ECSD, nothing crazy,but pretty.
Smell: This is what sold me, i feel like skunk strains have gotten lost in the mix because of kush and diesel being so popular. Well ive always felt like skunk was a kind of diesel (pine/chem/sour/skunk), and by crossin super skunk with ECSD they created  a undeniable ...”"

orgncwhtmlk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-sour-skunk/reviews/1229054,"“Beautiful greens and even dark purples deep in the buds. Lots of little trichomes make the bud glisten. The smoke is mellow and smooth. Taste is fair. Nothing out of this world though. The high is mellow and I think for myself I could smoke a good 1.5 G king size and be perfect. Maybe this batch is better for novice smokers. I like more punch/kick/flooring meds. lol Just my opinion as of now. The bud is still beautif...”"

Whenever i have some SSS i cant stop smiling, laughing an being all around happy. Great for Depression, ADHD, PTSD, etc. IMO, this strain is a daytime strain. A few tokes and im on cloud 9. And for a strain with a lower THC content (roughly 15%), it packs a powerful punch. Keep in mind that THC doesn't always determine the potency, as Marijuana is made of a recipe of chemi...”"

Now I will  spend the rest of my life looking for the genetics because I refuse to grow unless Sss. I won't  grow but for this one strain I would. Wish me a quick blessed finding of the Sss again it was July 14 2015”"
91Chevy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-sour-skunk/reviews/1637262,"“Super Sour Skunk has everything I look for in a Sativa Hybrid. The aroma of the buds is incredible. Rich sour citrus undercut with fuel and musky skunk fills your nostrils and makes your mouth water. 
The smoke is a little more dominant on the diesel side. Very rich, tingly and tasty. Quite smooth as well. Very satisfying smoke overall.
The high is everything I want in a daytime smoke. I feel very euphoric and energe...”"
