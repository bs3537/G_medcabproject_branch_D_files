Partook of this strain in the form of crumble in my dab pen. The high is a very rich feeling, happy, and heavy if that makes sense. The high truly feels "royal". The effects are very narcotic.

Its a creep high, one minute, I sat there with confusion about how high I was going to get off her. All of a sudden she hit me with her hybrid characteristics, as I felt full relaxation in my body with stress flowing away. Great high for the night time and great for sleeping!”"

The high is buzzy and enjoyable guaranteed to leave you sideways. Almost feels like popping a Vicodin. 

Recommended.”"

This strain is definitely more of an indica and gives you a great body high and is great for just chilling out. Won't just knock you out but if you are a little tired it will give you that extra push to being sleepy. We may never be royals but we will always be boat times.”"
