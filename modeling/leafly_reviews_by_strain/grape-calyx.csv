Beautiful bud structure with a wonderful sweet yet earthy urkle like aroma. The smoke is smooth and sweet, and brings on a very tranquil stone. The recent CW Analytics analysis we received came in at 25.6% THC with a great terpene profile. You have to experience Grape Calyx yourself to truly understand just how great this one...”"

Bud I had was a sparkling and colorful work of art and the potency is top notch. Super loud nose of grape soda mixed with earthy kush notes. Burned super clean and not at all harsh and tastes just like the smell. The 1/8th I scored was clean green certified and was given to me for free at a mmj convention in Oak...”"
