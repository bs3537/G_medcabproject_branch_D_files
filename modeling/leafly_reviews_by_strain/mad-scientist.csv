She went from unable to move, forced to lay flat, to walking around and sitting up.  I love when I find a strain that really helps with her pain. Thank you!!!”"
SPHOENIX,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mad-scientist/reviews/1378758,"“Now the given name "Mad Scientist" makes sooooo much sense!

The electricity in my brain had my thoughts pinging from one end to another.  I couldn't hush them to save my life! I genuinely thought I was going mad!
The strain touches on it's ability, minimally, to spark cr...”"

This is, at this time, my favorite strain on the planet! It smells soooo good and is very strong. The feeling is extremely whole body and leaves me feeling very relaxed but still alert and happy! I am learning that buying just based on THC content is not necessarily the way to go, as the trichome development, and cannabinoids and terpenes...”"

Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mad-scientist/reviews/1271005,"“The Herijuana side of Mad S put me in a really mellow mood, and made watching Game of Thrones really intense.  Finally lulled me into a a nice sleep.  My mind wandered a bit as  I tried to sleep as it does with anything that has even a trace of Sativa in it, and It did give me a slight headache, but overall very good night time strain.”"

For real though if you want to really de-stress at the end of the day, this is a winner. Be warned -- it's damn strong. This indica don't play! If you smoke this make no immediate plans.”"
Majestic12man,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mad-scientist/reviews/1380279,"“This one is a first rate bomb. Very uncomfortable pressure headache similar to headband which I also detest. Zero pain relief. Made me drowsy enough to eventually pass out. But by then what difference does it make? Still in severe body pain and now my head feels like shit thanks to this studebaker of strains. I sincerely mean no offense to its advocates. I just don't know how else to say it. Fuck this one. Never agai...”"

Maldi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mad-scientist/reviews/1547335,"“I didn't know anything about TJ's Mad Scientist; but sure glad I did try something new.  This strain was good and effective.  I personally got a energy rush similar to a sativa, which got me busy with projects. Got busy doing things.  Eventually, the sensations mellowed and a sweet mellow mood followed.  I will try this again. 
TJ's Organic Gardens pre-rolled are top shelf quality.”"
