Shellysage,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1371501,"“This strain has single handedly saved my life. I suffer from a rare neuromuscular disease similar to MS. Life is difficult for me. My body constantly hurts and I run out of energy quickly. Zeta is amazing. It gives my body a nice relaxed high which keeps it from hurting and me being constantly in pain. This helps me not to be so tired out. And it gives be focus and stamina throughout the day. I've been able to stop m...”"
DarkestBreed,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1410456,"“Fast hitting mastetpiece...
Perfect example of smart breeding, Sage calms the OG as the OG calms the Sage, instant relaxation, uplifting, creative and almost a clear headed euphoria. best use og the OG genetic I've come across thus far”"
pipeppl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1371500,"“I love zeta sage! I actually named our pipe after it... it's a perfect strain to relax with. it can be light and if you smoke enough it can be super heavy. the heavy high comes with some paranoia and makes you feel like time is standing still. the bud smells amazing: lemony but not too sweet. it's a good tasting smoke too. it's the first strain I bought in Denver and I'm sure I'll always keep some on hand”"
mothbroth,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1410457,"“Absolutely wonderful bud for inspiration and action, I'm not feeling sluggish at all!”"
clatonator1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1371499,"“Overall solid stain. With parents of Sage and OG Kush, it is an incredibly strong head high. You almost get the feeling your head is floating off of your body. Very relaxing this stain does seem to cause paranoia even at high rates of consumption. Good outdoors bud.”"
TrevinE,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1360668,"“Always love a pungent batch zeta sage. Good daytime smoke but also helps me relax and sleep at bed time.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1471593,"“Been wanting to try this for awhile, no joke when they say it has a diesel aroma. I got a half gram of terp sauce, I took a whiff it smelled so much like diesel I was concerned maybe all the chemicals were still in it. It's just that stanky.  Slight mint on exhale.
Definite euphoria. Some strains you can't notice their unique characteristics but this buzz is definitely noticeable & unique. I can't wait to wake & bake...”"
ChloeJaneDoed,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1360667,"“Been feeling very nauseous lately and smoked some Zeta Sage and immediately my nausea went a way. Great strain, very good for smoking through out the day and still being able to function.”"

llmead,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1501126,"“zeta sage is insane. the first night i had it i i laughed harder than any strain has ever made me. the second night i hallucinated (while still laughing.) would definitely recommend for people who need an uplifter.”"

ScabCasserole,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1428572,"“A nice, more practical version of a strain like Golden Goat. Works for having to toil on a personal project. Classic and delicious.”"
N8tiveCOKush303,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1185159,"“I love it like everyone else. It tastes great, looks great, and has a very balanced high. If you smoke a lot it can be pretty heavy but great otherwise.”"
seikaru1722,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1360670,"“Definitely my favorite strain!!!!! I could smoke this everyday. Great for headaches and nausea. It didn't overwhelm my mind.... very very clear high.”"
EdibleEm,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1368950,"“I like this strain, energizes me and provides a good heady buzz. Helpful for get-up and go but I sometimes find if I'm tense this one makes me clench my jaw. Could be one to cause headaches in the super sensitive. Easy to smoke, even in the bong, no coughing fits or anything. Great strain for depression or something that slows you down like hypothyroid type issues. Helps me focus and get it done!”"

Nismosis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1304443,"“My favorite sativa strain ever. Perfect for daytime smoking. The keef I collected was super potent, it melted and bubbled like hash in the bowl when I smoked it. This is one of the most underrated strains out there in my opinion. Also, I think that the way flower potency tests are conducted make the flower potency test less efficient with this strain. In other words, I find that the flowers I buy seem to be more pote...”"

BigSquirm,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zeta-sage/reviews/1607665,"“So I signed up to review this one. In flower, it is zingy from the get go with energy! Great Sativa head buzz with zero anxiety.  Only reason I give it 4.5/5 stars is that it has that sharp, harsh diesal gas taste that is really harsh to me.  You will know this stuff when you smell it 100%.  It smells exactly like a J-13.  Don’t get me wrong, it has flavor but it has that acrid fume nature to the smoke and the vapor,...”"

The bud itself is more fluffy like Lucky Charms, but is sticky ,The buds have a darker green, medium sizes to large. Taste has a planty sweet diesel. High is focusing and relaxed.”"
