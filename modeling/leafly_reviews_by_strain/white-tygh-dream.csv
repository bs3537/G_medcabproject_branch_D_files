OxnardCA805,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-tygh-dream/reviews/1436798,"“I love this strain! The smell is great, and the taste is as well. I like this one esp. for relaxing at night and no focus more and before bed time. The best indica I know so far! But just know, you can only find this one in Oregon.”"

I rolled a few joints for a day trip out fishing and the already beautiful surroundings seemed to glow a bit brighter. I would love to see it as a concentrate of some kind.”"
