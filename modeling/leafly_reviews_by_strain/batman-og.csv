If you imagine yourself being batman or Robin (in costume or out) I wouldn't be surprised such a strong high I wish I had some now to mix in with my mid grade stuff. Had to write a review b/c it was super loud like a dub-step concert. I got a gram a week or two ago. *****(5)”"

StackGreen86,https://www.leafly.com/indica/batman-og/reviews/1512773,"“This bad boy will knock you down. It's an extremely potent strain that gives you a mind-numbing, zombie trance inducing stone. I only gave 4 stars because I don't prefer this kind of high, but if its what you want, you'll be one happy customer. Crystals everywhere, and even vaping it messed my lungs up. Sucks my memory and sense of punctuality. I would recommend with some food, a warm home, and a movie.”"

Gluemangoo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/batman-og/reviews/1464496,"“It's the old school taste from back in the days 12 years ago. Full skunk and full bouquet in taste and flavor.”"

chiefbigbong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/batman-og/reviews/1569690,"“This is one seriously heavy, hard-hitting indica. I have a high tolerance but one moderate size bowl of Batman OG sent me into a blissful, zoned out, almost trance-like haze for at least an hour. After that it settled into a smooth but strong indica high for another 90 minutes or so. Highly recommended but only for those looking for a very heavy-bodied and very heavy-headed experience.”"
