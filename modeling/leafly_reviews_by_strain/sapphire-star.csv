EdibleEm,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sapphire-star/reviews/1317846,"“I liked the calm cerebral high of this strain and the fact that even though I was relaxed I didn't feel lazy or fatigued. One side effect I don't need but good for my friends with food challenges- made me monster munch out! Good for relaxing and doing yoga or small chores, not a real pain killer but a mood lifter for sure. Probably a 3.8 for me, made me cough a little but a blast from my inhaler solved it so it wasn'...”"

Sapphire OG (or sapphire star as listed here) puts you in a different universe. I made the mistake of having 3 hits of the vape 3 HOURS before my next class. I thought I’d be fine because I’m a regular smoker and use it for pain, and I usually do a couple hits before so I’m not high but I’m not too anxious to not absorb any information. Sapphire FUCKED...”"

This flower (at least the cut I saw/smoked) has everything going for it. Masterfully grown, beautiful, clean green , high thc content and the best tasting flower I've smoked in quite some time . I think I've only given one other 10/10 ranking but this without a doubt 10/10”"

There jarred up currently but will eventually get ground together and smoked , I'll come back later to review that.

Supervillin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sapphire-star/reviews/1735996,"“Hits fast and strong. Vaped at least, you hold that first deep hit and you feel it in the head, behind the eyes, in the ears, then a minute later all down the legs.

First cerebral couch lock I've experienced - it's intense and focused, but you don't want to move. Just listen to music, really listen, for a good five minutes before coming back for another hit.”"

STRWBRY,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sapphire-star/reviews/1453483,"“The best thing about Sapphire Star is that it puts you in a calm and focused state while still feeling high. It's not as heavy or fun as the others but it's the best thing to smoke when you have work or you have something to do. Not the best but it is something.”"

LeifTheRaver,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sapphire-star/reviews/1536416,"“Definitely not for me. The smoke was nice and smooth, bud was grown well, just didn’t hit hard. Nice relaxed feeling and more uplifted but completely functional. Perfect for beginners! Disappointing for stoners who need a heavy-hitter.”"
