For the entire weight of the flower after trimmed and cured... the sheer wieght of the trichomes account for a large % of the exact weight. It's oder is not changed upon combustion and you exhale the same oderferous flavor that is inhaled and not often is that achived, namely with hybrids.

shortfiction,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-jack/reviews/1412759,"‚ÄúThis strain makes me super active. I like to smoke this, put on some music, and clean the house. Yes, it makes cleaning "fun," but with the changed sense of time you may be cleaning that toilet for 10 minutes. Makes me feel kind of jittery - like I want to move, but not anxious. I can focus, but also kind of deep space at the same time. I also get pretty warm smoking this stain.‚Äù"

I loaded up the "History of the Eagles" on Netflix and loaded up my Pax 2 with the green, crystally bud I had ground up.

Just an all around amazing bud, blackjack combines 2 heavy strains Black Domina a heavy heavy indica mixed with the extreme sativa Jack Herer  crossing these two together is going to produce very dense buds wrapped in light orange hairs and frosted all over, she produces a very pungent type smell, almost like a straight haze with a touch of pungent cheese, with the combo of a straight indica an...‚Äù"
joshchavo88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-jack/reviews/1415100,"‚ÄúThis has quickly become my favorite strain. I find I can either relax or be active with this. First you get that relaxing, sedative vibe that an indica gives you, but it doesn't give you couch lock. After that I start getting kind of...jittery, or like I want to move, but without feeling anxious. So I could either relax and watch some tv or go on a trip and clean the house. It's the only strain I've tried that makes ...‚Äù"

This is shatter produced by the company Pure Concentrates.

Kaihuna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-jack/reviews/1312483,"‚ÄúExcellent, well balanced  strain.  Smells of rich Frankincense and other pine/earth tones, giving it a wonderful overall character.  Smoke is smooth, effects are instant and mellow.
