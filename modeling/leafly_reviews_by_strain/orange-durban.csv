There's so much shit to look at right now that I don't even know how to begin. I should probably go back out and tab a cart, after my eye appointment.

Dat sample selection. Can't wait :) Mmnnmmmmmn.... samples... mmmmMmmMmmmmmMMMmMmmmm...

I use sativas for working out, and this might be my favorite sativa strain yet! Focus was top notch and had a great lifting without. My thoughts were clear and no paranoia AT ALL, which is normally not the case for me. Will definitely be keeping orange Durban on hand!”"

I have only tried it as a concentrate (bho) by Subdued Excitement but the flavor is incredible, it's all about the terps, the flavor is very bright and sweet like orange candy it coats the mouth and u will be able to smell and taste oranges for quite a while. The high is very upbeat and happy it gives you a boost of energy and mood. All in all it's a great func...”"

Extremely uplifting, tunnel vision effects, don’t do this while driving. It’s super loud then mellows out just leaving you happy and safe and buzzing. Rarely does a vape pen cartridge zone me out so well. Also very tasty, citrusy orange , juicy. I finished this off in a day. Don’t vape while driving. I hit it at a stop light and I felt like I was wa...”"
