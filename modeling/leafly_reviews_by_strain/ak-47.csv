You also start to get very creative. Your mind is overflowing with ideas. You can also feel the wind very nicely. Wind makes you tingly. Everything seems like a dream or footage of a music video.  Can make you a little dizzy sometimes. Makes you very relaxed to the point you would easily sleep. You FEEL the music. ...”"

Smoking out of a normal 1 perk bong with ice. Had a minimal breakfast and have been awake for 2 hours and I am smoking about 0.35g.

It settles in just at the back of your head. What is this feeling you ask? It's a small gang of figurative Somali pirates lurking within this strain...they have an agenda, to steal all of your stress and anxiety away.

It did not disappoint, very good at reducing nausea while at the same time very energetic with an uplifted mood, not euphoric by any means but felt good.  At times I felt I was prone to chatter quickly but could have been in my mind.  As long as it's available I would have it around a...”"

Knocks you out if you need a good night's sleep.”"
