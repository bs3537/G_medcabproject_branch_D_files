sodey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/qush/reviews/1278309,"“Really fire looking buds with lots of orange hairs, yet not super frosty looking.  Smells great and draws great. Total body high with great pain relief. My face felt numb in a good way. Definitely a night time strain, unless you like being a zombie around people.”"
LeroyBrown420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/qush/reviews/1238135,"“Can't relax, need to unwind? Quash it all with Qush. A great tasting, smooth smoking old genetic strain that will take the edge off. Indica dominate but not couch locking. Kills pain and stress related illnesses. Great mood promoter and helps dull unwanted thoughts. Not the best pick for work or school, ideal for weekends, week nights and other special occasions.”"

Also great for sleeping without it, woke up every hour on the hour and smoking before bed helped me get a solid sleep of six hours.”"
