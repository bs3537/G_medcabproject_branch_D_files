A decent strain by Delta9, smelled a mix between feet and @ss, no lie! Great bud, did a great job.”"

Hits you with bursts of happiness and positivity after just a couple of minutes. Enhances creativity and thought pace while at the same time relaxing body and muscles. Works both day- and nightime. I really like it!”"
