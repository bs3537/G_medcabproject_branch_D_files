Being a slightly sativa dominate strain, you really can have the best of both worlds with Electric Kool Aid. Wowee wow the euphoria given off those grape hinted, crystal covered buds when lit is spectacular. The forrest reminiscent scent is pungent & tickles your nostrils. The taste is tarty, berriful. Very pleasant and mellow. The experience is just the ...”"

My friend Ms. Electric Koolaid, and I haven't known each other long, but what we do know of each other, she is a sticky, and dense mistress. And don't get me started on her other good points! Ms.  EKA is a very social lady, and is always up for a good time.”"
Arnaud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/electric-kool-aid/reviews/1245855,"“Got that strain from a dispensary in Eugene, OR, very dense nuggets covered with white crystals, the smell is sweet and has piney aroma with berry and lavender undertones. I smoked it in a joint and appreciated the smoothness with a creamy finish almost like smoking Grand daddy purple but sweeter and smoother. I fell pain free halfway through the joint and worry free but motivated and creative in the same time.”"
DreamX,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/electric-kool-aid/reviews/1265399,"“Energetic, happy, and dreamy, and great for an active, sunny day. The intense purple of the leaves is hilarious, as is the weird mix of skunk and lavender odors (Pepe le Peu wearing Lilac Vegetal), but a nice tasty feeling for a day at the beach.”"

Nice relaxation, and it kept my legs still when I went to bed. I slept pretty well on this one, I'll try it again for pain relief. Nice uplift in mood!”"

As soon as the first toke graced my pulmona, I knew I was in for one hell of a trip to the higher plane. The sensation of this strain's fade is unlike any other. True to its namesake, the high felt profoundly sugary. EKA is a must rip for any stoner, fledgling adventurers and seasoned veterans alike.”"
