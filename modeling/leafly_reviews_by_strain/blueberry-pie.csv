bleafnmiracles,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pie/reviews/1415945,"“This strain is exceptional for both medical and recreational use. I personally haven't had many strains where the best of both strains crossed manifests in the new flower, this is the exception. The blue dream portion comes through *amazingly* on this strain. But because of that, I wouldn't recommend this strain for people that are uncomfortable with strong psychedelic effects. This strain starts you off with a dream...”"

I enjoyed this so much I regret not cloning it before it flowered.  It tastes like pie and leaves a sweet taste on my tongue and teeth.  It is strong, a guy I met in the woods on a hike asked for some meds so I shared a bowl with him.  Turns out he's a grower and it blew him away after one hit!  Said he was fine so I just smiled and finished...”"

I have tried so many different strains to touch the pain in my back/uterus and nothing has ever worked like this. This doesn't play up my extreme emotions or cause me to have anxiety, I can genuinely relax and lay back without any pain. However it does ...”"

I'm able to go to yoga and run errands (no driving of course) while functioning absolutely fine but I can relax and sleep great.  Nice high that lasts quite awhile for me.  Highly recommend.

loveslove,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pie/reviews/1337259,"“i think i prefer the two cross strains for blueberry pie on their own, but while smoking a joint of this strain with flu-like symptoms, the taste of this powered through and the pain subsided a bit. 

i'll write another review of this when i feel better. i'd give girl scout cookies a 5 and blue dream a 5, this was a strong 4-4.5 for me.”"
Bosrox81,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pie/reviews/1333538,"“It's absolutely terrific, it's very sweet tasting and the crystals are dominantly covering the flower. totally mellow and numbing for all the right reasons. I put this strain in my top 5 easy, nice job!!!”"

So, this is good because I have zero appetite, and the only way I can enjoy or even want to eat food is if I have weed that gives me the munchies.

ronwest,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pie/reviews/1372695,"“First whiff smells somewhat piney or minty but also has a strong underlying sweet scent. After grinding, these same smells become much more pungent.

The buds are tight, dense and covered in trichomes. They have a bright green color with some short light brown and amber hairs. One nug even had a blueish hue to it!

The smoke is tasty and sweet! The inhale is very reminiscent of GSC in it's flavor and the exhale remin...”"
keelyce,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pie/reviews/1390059,"“This is one of my all time favorite strains. It has the sweet smell similar to blue dream, and it tastes just the same. The high is instantly uplifting— regardless of blueberry pie being a hybrid, it feels much more like a sativa. Definitely get this strain if you have the chance!”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pie/reviews/1379435,"“Definitely a bit of let down but only because of expectation, good blueberry flavor and scent though. Smokes like a heavy handed haze. Mellow and relaxing, seems less potent than either parent but still has a nice well rounded buzz to it. Would like to see a cut that leans a bit more to the GSC side. Found Cookie Wreck to be a better sativa/GSC cross with similar but stronger effects personally. 3.5/5.”"

All in all this is a very good daytime smoke and allows u to do the things u need to do without the mind racing, and the self induced anxieties, most of us create.
