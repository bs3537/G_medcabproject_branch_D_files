weazal,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangie/reviews/1418739,"“It's a creeper! Took 10+ minutes before full effects became really noticeable. Extremely clear-headed and capable. The sativa raciness in your chest feels like juicy fruit (not the gum lol). It's got a fizzy tingle; like seltzer water carbonation. 

Entire body's noticeably relaxed and totally at ease. Strong, feel good medicative powers there.

Very cool, zen-like head space. Starting to feel motivated and creative....”"

Smooth smoke, tasty fruity hints, comes on strong but levels out to a focused relaxed high, energetic tones, creative tones, but mostly stress and anxiety seem to melt away on this one, leaving you happy and content. Great for new smokers or vets. I smoked this with someone that rarely smokes and they never experianced such a non-paronia from the high. I Highly recommend trying this one! Rare indeed. - BAM”"

From the incredible smell to the tightly packed calyxes coated with a light layer of trichomes this is a pleasing plant to many of the senses. The high isn't like Green Crack or racy and even though I suffer from anxiety constantly this is a sativa strain that doesn't provoke it and actually does a solid job of suppressing or at least making me forget about it for a bit.

In my 15+ years of sampling all types of marijuana, tangie has one of the best smells I have ever encountered. It's nothing short of a punch in the face of citrus and pine.

Dispensary- RISE Bethesda
Tastes amazing. Exactly like the name; that's the best way to describe it. Uplifting high that is also relaxing. Good for both physical and mental illness. Gives you full relief of many medical problems without a very strong psychedelic high, leaving you more productive and less stuck/frozen. Love this strain. 5/5”"
