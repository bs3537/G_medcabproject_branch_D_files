vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1385681,"“Vaped a loose bowl. About 1/2 bowl if it were packed. I am glad I went slow, a packed bowl might have been too much. Didn't hit right away but Felt Like a Full Bowl. 
Very lemony, smooth with a slight sharp musk.  I got a strongly euphoric and very active high and felt I just *had to immediately get busy*.  Folded all the laundry and socks even though it was not my job, and even enjoyed every minute of it.”"

So tote lightly first. Great for migraine relief. Gave me an extreme pep in my step...lol. One of my new favorites. Also you don't have the super munchies...”"
SparklyBunny1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1374300,"“Let me just say first, I've never gotten so lit before off of one bowl. This weed has to be the best bang for your buck. A little goes a really far way with this.

This strain generally has a high THC content compared to the other strains I usually smoke. It's brilliant. I feel productive, relaxed, happy, and have a great time while smoking it. 

The best way to smoke it in my opinion is in a joint taking small puffs...”"

Melicious,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1199866,"“This strain has a beautiful citrusy aroma. Reminding me of a glass of crisp lemonade. The effects were outstanding. It was a perfectly timed with sunset after a long day in the sun.”"
mfanelli1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1377266,"“Very nice and clear cerebral effects. Not too sedative yet enough to put my nerves at ease.”"
OldToby214,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1370939,"“Super great strain, fun active high that cannot be overstated. Anxiety washes away as soon as you start smoking this strain. A euphoric body and head high that has a prevalent sativa side.”"

KitsuneNaturalWellness,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1391998,"“I've never tried the Lemon Alien Dawg before, but it sounded too fun to pass up!

-Smell:  It has a nice earthy and skunky smell like good bud will, but it had a savory scent to it that I can't quite put my finger on but it makes it truly complex.

-Look:  The buds appear to be a brighter green than normal until you realize that it is covered in trichomes.

-Taste:  It has a great earthy and skunky taste with a littl...”"

Upon opening the bag I was slapped in the face with a strong lemon smell with hints of sour. The buds themselves are literally covered in crystals as well as long red hairs.

CaramelSmooth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1377268,"“A great strain for anxiety patients. Helps with nausea and lack of appetite as mentioned above.
Smoked a fat one and could really taste the lemon. It's kush heritage gives a nice euphoric feeling.”"

All around calm state of mind, with the general stoned feeling almost in a creeper strain. Smells, sweet with a linger of pine in rhe air and lemon in your taste buds!”"
OCHObabies,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1377267,"“I just had to try this! 30% thc and the buds are giant! A little spendy but worth it. The high is relaxing but also a good time i can either take a nap or go out on an adventure. It has a slight berry/lemon taste and almost smell. So amazing.”"
FlyPunk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1282704,"“Nice taste, not a wicked high. Helped with pain, it is a little creeper like. functioned nicely... then slept like a baby.   Quickly becoming one of my fav strains”"
OldHulkfan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1510060,"“Nice mind relaxing high but not overpowering. I was fine to do daily tasks after smoking a bowl (3-4 large to med. hits) and got a nice little boost in energy to help with those tasks. Nice for focus as well but expect some strong hunger so have some munchies handy.”"

Cannassuer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1248121,"“Amazing flavor, incredible smell, and excellent results. This is one strain you should stick with when you find it. There is an excellent cut of it in Spanaway at HOC.  Definitely worth checking out.”"

I’ve tried this strain 3 different times and each time I’ve had the same experience, a nice light high that makes me feel calm, relaxed, and focused. The problem is that when the high goes away, it happens suddenly like it’s sucked out of me and it’s very noticeable. Also the high has only lasted a...”"

Effects are sedating yet as I'm typing now I'm still pretty functional, which is nice. Dont get me wrong, with this strain you can zone out and chill all day if you want. Im gonna go do that now. Gdt yourself some of this green!”"

sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1762388,"“Got this by doc and yeti in WA. Asked budtender for a creative strain, and they suggested alien dawg. Didn’t get creative juices moving but got my  nostrils flaring from funky lemon aroma and my tongue lapping the top of my mouth after a flavorful toke. Definitely got my focus razor sharp, as I felt like I could read beyond my education level. Nice relaxation in body and uplifting euphoria. I’ll get again.”"

Not to mention, I love the sweet and tangy citrus notes.”"
Shabowski,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-alien-dawg/reviews/1304656,"“This strain is fantastic. Pungent smell with lemon and hints of Chemdawg. When the nugs are broken apart the skunky smell becomes even more apparent revealing its Chemdawg and Lemon Kush genetics in the smell alone. Batch that I picked up is 26% CBD and 24% THC, very easy smoking out of both a dry pipe or bong. Strong lemon flavor when smoked with a subtle kush after taste that lingers in your nostrils. Very relaxed ...”"

 Not tooo strong,  but just the right hit made me feel like I was in a 7up commercial in a great way.
