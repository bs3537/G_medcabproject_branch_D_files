Copper Kush
=============
fernleafly,https://www.leafly.com/indica/copper-kush/reviews/1094856,"“Mostly a body high and very strong. Felt it quickly but the more intense body high came a little later. Made me very sleepy and tingly, a great nighttime smoke but not if you want to do anything other than zombie-out. Great smell, too.”"
Mikefu,https://www.leafly.com/indica/copper-kush/reviews/1131270,"“Great Indica strain, with very strong body high. Was still able to concentrate relatively well, but felt waves of tingles washing over my body, followed by a strong numbing sensation.  Overall, very enjoyable.”"

Leafhead,https://www.leafly.com/indica/copper-kush/reviews/1191510,"“This gave me a good head high the first hour. Then I felt a body relaxing high. In 3rd hour, either I became very sleepy or could not sleep depending on person.  Did not give a good night's rest.  Felt Sativa like to me.”"
