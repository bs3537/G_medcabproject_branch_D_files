Fruit Spirit
=============
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1397064,"“By far Fruit Spirit is the strain for those who have horrendous mood swings. It balanced me and made me meditate and take a nap it kind of reset me, even though it felt like a nap and meditation was actually listening to washed out and spaced out. It changed the way I valued life it was incredible and I can't describe that I felt the same, just that there was more in life and it changed me I can't get enough of this ...”"

It's smell is , weird: it just smells like, weed, with a bit of a flowery undertone that's hard to define. The taste is a bit heavy with a very peppery flavour on the tongue, with a dense but quickLy rising smoke. At First I thought I was selled a dud. But when I lit it up for the 2nd half, it went off. I felt sleepy and thoughts ...”"

Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1230968,"“This strain has been a favorite of mine for years. Fruit spirit has a very floral sweet berry like smell. The vape is not as thick but not thin either it lingers around for a bit. I do not have PMS but dramatic mood swings, If you are looking in your dispensaries it is a hard strain to find. If you really want a vacation then fruit spirit will be your guide. Taste 10/10 Medical Dosage: Three Pinches. For me it's like...”"

MitchellandFinese,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1610906,"“I was looking for something to smoke in the mornings that would help me get my day going and this joint of fruit pebbles did the trick. You can smell the fruity scent off the bud as soon as you open the bottle. Good for getting the day going and keeping it going.”"

willegen447,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1322260,"“Amazing fresh strain!! doesn't smell fresh but the high ... WOW.. we grew it this year in the burning sun in holland and the results: even better and stronger that the local store who sells it for 12,50 per gram.
super relaxation !!!”"
chicanaqueen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1455929,"“When I smoked this and it kicked in I just wanted to laugh and I couldn't stop smiling. This strain is utter bliss. After that wore off I felt like I was flying and it felt so good. Finished off into a peaceful heavy body feeling, but still awake enough for me to function. Perfect for depression and pain. Giving 4 stars because it had a little bit of an herbal taste more than I prefer.”"

Pharoh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1389319,"“3/3 homogeneous seed specimens  ~ no scent of fruit in growth ~ no scent of fruit once dried ~ no taste of fruit ~ light yielding unless trained ~ earthy flavour and scent ~ spicy flavour and scent ~ foliage indica ~ flowers sativa ~ no more than 8 weeks flower ~ NOT what it says on the tin, still mighty swell.”"
Herborizer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1254467,"“This strain is nothing less than a gift from the gods. It's feels like your head gets wrapped in cotton candy. You'll laugh a lot and feel super relaxed while your body remains active. Also, it is a nice strain to  smoke at a party because while your mind gets sucked into the music you're still being able to dance for hours. Definitely one of my favourite strains”"
jorgesgvn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1472566,"“A menos de 5 minutos de haber fumado un bowl completo me siento en total relajación corporal. Justo después del primer levantón se siente ligero el cuerpo y los pensamientos. Un poco después se pone algo entumecido el cuerpo. relajación absoluta.  No es el caso hoy, pero estoy seguro que debe ser muy buena en caso de ansiedad o depresión.”"

Unknownhorsey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1262483,"“This strain is really everything for me.
Although it is not as fruity as its name stands for, it is very subtle and mind blowing at the same time. 
It really has a bit of pepper into it and tastes a bit harsh, the buds are quiet dry and it is not sticky in any way.
The formation of this strain are not huge buds but meduim sized.
It's good for mainlining for the experienced growers and it'll yield greatly in that meth...”"
dirtydawg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1331247,"“Very nice tight buds, has a slight fruit taste with a bit of pepper on the back end. Used in a Pax original, light vapor that was quite smooth. Very nice relaxing buzz that slowly creeps into the bones.”"
negropirata,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1370760,"“Es una delicia esta cepa. Tiene un sabor dulce y fuerte, pero agradable.
Pega un subidón bien happy y es buena para compartir, muy sociable.
Tiré 2 outdoor y los resultados fueron buenísimos en ambas, sobre 2 mts.”"

In jar cure is going to make it even better i reckon. I can only describe it as light menthol butterscotch cream. Reminiscent of the sweet/candy Murray Mints in smell. There are berry undertones sitting there also which i hope increase over the curing period. When burnt there is an earthy fresh classic resin hash smell w...”"

Joe_Grows10,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-spirit/reviews/1173823,"“Really good Sativa leaning hybrid, great to focus with. I study and workout with this strain works well every time. When growing this plant in flowering the plant becomes slightly more picky and sensitive to nute changes. One can easily lock this plant out and kill it. First time I grew it almost happened, this being my second time all systems seem good thus far 5 weeks into flowering.”"

Flavour is more floral than fruity.  Makes me cough almost as bad as Cheese and Chemdawg did and the ONLY thing I can say that is good about this is the appearance and the fact that it lasts a decent amount of time in my Davinci Vape... The smell is fairly good, I will say that much for it.  I will not buy it again.  The...”"
