Stevieg59,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wild-thailand/reviews/1546826,"“This is a super nice smoke, very slight lung expansion, smooth, flavorful, satisfying, medium bodied smoke... with of all things, a pleasant aftertaste!  Effects came on for over 15 minutes, a true creeper so rare, cherished and prized.  Once all the way there, the effects are bright and trippy, giggly euphoric and talkative but with strong body effects.  Played my electric guitar, then took Hunter the dog for a long...”"

SecretSquirrel01,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wild-thailand/reviews/1473614,"“Easy to grow but stretches quite a bit during flower. Yeilds are excellent and potent. The smoke is strong and has an excellent flavor. The high is very long lasting.”"
joe123181,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wild-thailand/reviews/1561607,"“One of the best smokes in all my smoking days. A very strong sativa, made me feel alert, focused, motivated, very happy, and almost numb. Great daytime strain but likely not a good bed time strain.”"

I vaped this in my convection CFV last night and it was pure enjoyment . Yes I know it’s classed as a Sativa , which I have found some strains work on my system like a good Indica. I was totally surprised at the slow gentle way it relaxed my body, released the heaviness of a long day of wor...”"

Equilibrated,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wild-thailand/reviews/1576729,"“Uplifting and intensely cerebral but not racy. A bouquet of spring floral notes with what I though was a slight background of chocolate. A bit longer lasting than typical sativas with a very fast onset and slower come down. Very exotic.”"
greenganj89,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wild-thailand/reviews/1625070,"“First off, i'm glad I stumbled upon this strain at the secret stash which is an awesome dispensary. The buds I got are nice and dense with a super citrusy/lemon smell. Not a racy sativa at all which is nice to chill out and relax. Buds are a nice lime green with orange hairs protruding from it with nice trichrome coverage. Upon breaking the bud open there is a mass of trichrome goodness. Very nice developed bud with ...”"

powpo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wild-thailand/reviews/1797785,"“Um dos cheiros mais "fortes" que já senti. Foge do convencional tanto em essências quanto em efeitos. Aos amantes de sativa como eu, simplesmente abre portas. Ideias, concentração pra fazer atividades, disposição. Perfeito pra rolés ou até mesmo limpar a casa.”"
HerbalRemedied62301,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wild-thailand/reviews/1622133,"“Grabbed this on sale at Herbal Remedies in Quincy IL. PTS brand white film style bottle. Upon opening the bottle I was rewarded with a fresh sweet bubblegum odor. This product was very fresh and the buds were light and fluffy. The flavor reminded me of fresh greens with a light dank after taste. This particular strain began slow but picked up steam and settled squarely in my head. With a nice buzz yet retaining the a...”"

sensaiandy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wild-thailand/reviews/1483905,"“THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY! If you want to get high and this is the only option then smoke with people you are very comfortable and close with. This will make your high more enjoyable. Also play some chill ass music and relax, think happy thoughts. Might be challenging but talk about some informal shit. Don't be a nice around people who are dramatic as hell, this will throw off your high and increase an...”"
