Body high is amazing-my joint pain is gone and I'm very relaxed. I like that I feel present & alert but get such a nice feeling all over. This was like a good hug. My Budtender is the true MVP for suggesting this strain today.”"
EdibleEm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rare-dankness-1/reviews/1383213,"“Not a big Indica fan, more of a Sativa girl myself but this bud is super nice. Loved the taste, burned nice, and totally helped me with muscle stiffness and pain. Liked that the high was not too 'heavy' and that I still felt energetic enough after smoking to get things done. Good puff for da pain!”"

chevs420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rare-dankness-1/reviews/1489150,"“This Strain Is now my Favorite by Far. It has a very Fruity Berry flavor, Bag appeals is insane looks straight out of High Times. Small Craft Farm, that does everything by hand from Seed to Flower and no Spays. I wouldn't suggest for beginners as I would guess it's a 70/30 Indica side around 25%+ ... I've been using Marijuana for 30 years now. I seen my fair share of Strains I mostly Vape Shatter. But this Flower Put...”"

LotusKai,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rare-dankness-1/reviews/1373198,"“Love this strain. This strain is a parent plant to so many of my favorite strains such as Rare Darkness or 501st OG. Anytime you see this strain as a parent plant to any other strain I would recommend getting it, though of course getting this strain itself is always a better option if possible.”"

ABitFloaty,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rare-dankness-1/reviews/1637122,"“Wow -- 2nd favorite strain so far.  Within a few minutes I was slammed with a heavy duty floaty overall body high.  30 Minutes later it really kicked in...but allowed me to remain clear thinking the whole time.  Definitely a potent strain for when you have no driving or serious work to do.  No couch lock, no anxiety or paranoia...just absolutely relaxed with no thoughts of pain.”"
