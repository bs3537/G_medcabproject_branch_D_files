Ataraxia Labs named this "G6" but this should be the same as jet fuel so here's my review...

(SCI - T3 ) 

My first reaction was that the draw that I felt when I puffed it was like taking a drag of a very minty berry/blueberry  cool flavored strain...

Very focused, creative laid back feeling, able to real chores done if needed but very comfortable high overall.

I used it for inflammation , m...”"
Nikongirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1415821,"“Love this for my wake and bake  heading to work. I work in a high demand, high performance call centre job. So  I  need a buzz that helps me focus with my ADD and anxiety.  It keeps me clear headed, energized and chipper. I'm not a morning person at ALL. And every day I've worked early shifts this week I've been on point and feeling Great. Jet  Fuel, baby!”"
John18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1417516,"“Sweet and smooth, like a fine lady on a summer's night.  Hits me first behind the eyes, as a strong sativa should, then mellowed out like a bull in a ring that has just had the final sword jab to the base of his skull.  Yes, it put me down...but unlike our bull, I have arisen to write this review.  5 stars for the Jet Fuel.”"
Toast2thegods,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1417517,"“Jet Fuel is the perfect name for this strain... Not only does it smell like filling up your G6 it also makes u feel like your taking off on a G6 with the first toke.... Be prepared to get medicated and have that mind racing faster than a G6 from the comfort of your living room...”"
BaronOfBud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1417518,"“Now I have had both a sativa and indica dominant version of Jet Fuel, I can give a appropriate response. I got some of The Original Dr. Greenthumb's infamous JET FUEL. An extremely power indica with heavy couch lock body effects and a distinct (gas) OG taste and aroma! The real JET FUEL. B-Real's Line.”"
HairKnife,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1380174,"“Combusted in glass, this is FAST ACTING, one of the more immediate strains.  Smells cheesy, moldy and STANKY....oh so delicious.  

Potency: THCA 17.98% CBD: 0.06%.  

Good for Multiple Sclerosis, Optic Neuritis, CNS issues, severe depression, chronic anxiety, brain fog.

PRO: You "see through the bullshit."  Understand systems and functions more clearly.
CON: You become super chatty.  Like "dude get off it man..."”"
g.kirk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1391660,"“This is a review for only DR. Greenthumb's Jet Fuel OG. Right off the top this strain will knock your nose off your face. My buddy's wife could smell me breaking it up from the back of the house. It's beautifully covered with some darker tricomes, maybe a yellow hue. Burgundy hairs run throughout the nugs. The smoke is extremely smooth, I really thought with the smell it would be harsh but it was one of the smoothest...”"
GettinHighSince95,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1380173,"“Wow this stuff is pungent!! Excellent wake and bake. Very long lasting and mellows out quite nice. Do not try to hide this strain. It smells like dank fuels and stinks up the whole house. It tastes like a piney gas tree if you could imagine that. I would definitely recommend this product to a serious  weed nerd.”"
PoisonIvy25,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1359509,"“I'm a medical marijuana patient treating fibromyalgia G6 is only the second strain I tried. I'm so glad that it was recommended to me. I vaped early in the day and slowly I started to feel so much more relaxed and in less pain than I had been been in a long time. It also got rid of some nausea that had been bothering me. If you are on opiates and looking for pain relief definitely try this strain.”"
Neil88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1375293,"“Hints of: Pine, dank



  On Set: After 5 mins with a delayed high with tingles, paranoia, euphoria, happiness



  High:
Heavy sedative effects on a vape.

Levels out to a happy relaxed feeling until it wears off.



  Conclusion:
Great aromas; over all nice high, on set like a sativa then drops to a very nice indica, but the indica high decreases with tolerance

ShadyKenshin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1564531,"“Jet Fuel melted my steel beams.

I thought there was a ghost in my house. 

Relaxing, enlightening, energizing (depending on who you are), and an overall great brain massage for those who have chronic migraines. Would recommend to patients with pain issues, depression and/or anxiety. 

Of course don't over medicate and give yourself a panic attack, we all know our limits.”"
TealSweep,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1260541,"“Sativa (70% Sativa, 30% Indica 100% awesome)

When burned, Jet Fuel smells like pure poison. I would not wish it on my worst enemy. The high is delightful; I have been suffering from deep deprrsession and an inability to eat lately, and JF has been helping me immensely. Big love.”"

If you need help relaxing sleeping or just taking the edge off this might be just a little more than you need but guaranteed it does work.  I used my Simba grinder and my vapor tower.  Standard scoop size is approximately one quarter gram.  Effects are not immediate but long-lasting.  It creeps in over the course of a half an...”"

I'm stoned for sure but I'm also able to be somewhat clear. I'm focused. I'm upbeat. I wish me and my dog were out on a hike and my feet were in the river right now. I also enjoy this before starting a movie or a netflix sesh. I can watch several episodes before falling asleep. The first his is take off and it's a smooth flight!”"
AliGG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1538727,"“This is hands down one of the best strains I’ve smoked.

Nuff said 🔥”"
getAbongarong,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1185480,"“For THC purposes, it doesn't get much better than this strain. The collective labeled it 31-33% THC (I can't remember precisely)…I didn't believe them until I got home and lifted off. This is definitely a strain for Indica lovers, as it lacks the tingly euphoria of a strong Sativa or good hybrid. It'll also make you very sleepy and hungry. I'm not a huge fan of the taste and smell of the Diesiel family, but Jet Fuel ...”"

Empty headed and spacey feeling. My wife kept asking me what was wrong, I felt ok, not happy or sad, just ok. It did make me pretty dizzy and it gave me horrible dry mouth. Sex is great on it, it makes you last quite a bit longer 😁 I'd say it was an average strain for me, probably won't add it to my favori...”"

I've become a huge fan of jet fuel's delicious sweet diesel flavor, and perfectly balanced effects.  The relaxation, and euphoria from this strain is real but the boost of cerebral activity always keeps me going wide awake.

I got sleepy after the racey sativa effects wore off. A bit paranoid/jittery for a bit after smoke. Mind wandered and I was pretty spaced out. Wasn't a big fan, kind of got me down and didn't want to go out because of a bit of paranoia/anxiety.”"

davidddx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1355494,"“This strain had me high as a kite with this powerful punch of sativa. Mind racing and body relaxing, this strain is amazing and got me stoned. only problem was a tad bit of paranoia, but personally I have lots of anxiety, so may be to blame.”"
rtiqulit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jet-fuel/reviews/1176746,"“Flavor: This strain has an abundance of lemonene the terpene is so prevalent Jet Fuel leaves an aftertaste similar to putting the contents of a box of lemon heads in your mouth at the same time more than likely derived from the debated Lemon Thai Heritage coupled with the faint taste of lemonene which is present in East Coast Diesel

I know there are different brands out there and this one is a "Gold Leaf" product.  Here are the numbers: 0.60 THC, 1.18 CBDA, 27.92 THCA, Total = 29.70.  When handling this bud, the aroma diffuses noticeably into the air.  To untrained noses it is skunky, but up close smells like animal w...”"

I hate this strain. I actually traded the rest of the 8th away, because it was not at all enjoyable. It reminded me of smoking ephedrine back in the day, yuck!”"
