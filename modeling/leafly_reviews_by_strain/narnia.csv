BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/narnia/reviews/1417412,"“Snagged some 'Chronic of Narnia' while in Oregon.  

I'm not sure how this strain was labeled an as indica but it was.  As for the appearance these buds were medium size, dense, slightly purple nugs, heavily trichomed.  Gorgeous really.  The taste and smell matched,  sweet floral notes with a nice earthy-ness. The effects are complex but I studied the high and found the following; There was absolutely zero sedation. ...”"

One gloomy gray day, I was unable to shake the melancholy. I smoked some Narnia in my bong and went into the wardrobe.  Soon, my mood began to improve.  I felt uplifted, creative and inspired.  I painted.  I exercised.  I danced.  I wrote. I planned for success.  Along the way, I had a few bouts of paranoia, but I dealt with ...”"

And if nothing but to overcome my own personal pride, I will admit that this is probably the finest indica I have seen in quite some time. It's absolutely among the finest indicas you'll find anywhere in this state (Oregon).

And most importantly - this is the pe...”"

It's hard to measure what qualities go into that assertions, but the two that come to mind are how high and how long? I'll admit I've been higher, but I don't recall enjoying being this high this much. Off a single hit, two hours later, and I'm still comfortably numb. Those two facts should bring a smile to your face, but now let me introduce you to the downside of this wonderw...”"

I was overjoyed to learn that a dispensary had opened up near my childhood town that I had just recently relocated to. The Gallery - Spanaway is my new stop for my marijuana needs.

A strain recommended to my wife by one of the Budtenders, she picked up this Sativa-dominant cross of Jack Herer (Sativa) and Trainwreck (Hybrid). We instantly fell in love with the strai...”"

Food tastes amazing. Music is incredible. I was dancing around my apartment for the last 30 minutes while munching on veggies and chocolate.”"

This is a great strain for crazy taste experiments and making art. Things seem to have a hallucinogenic shimmer - colors are more vibrant, edges more defined. It also makes me a more empathetic person. For me, it resembles a very mild mushroom trip. There are deep thoughts, a desire to be better, etc. It works wonderfully for my depress...”"

Has a very sweet scent to it that has hints of pine from the Jack Herer in it. Energizing but leaves me more spacey than focused. Ultimately puts me into an upbeat thoughtful, creative mood with motivation in tact. Still, it's so potent I wouldn't bank on this one allowing you to be very productive unless you're a heavyw...”"

Narnia! Perfect name for this one! Though a sativa, This personally felt like an indica to the mind, it's a deep, almost groggy high, if you overindulge the Trainwreck will surely be most dominant. The Jack Herer saves this by keeping the high uplifted and very tolerable.

Whenever I have this, I smoke it before I go somewhere beautiful because it's such a bright, pleasant high it's hard not to appreciate everything around you on another level. For such a strong sativa, it doesn't make my thoughts race too fast for comfort and comes with very minimal paranoia. Surprisingly and delightfully carefree and energetic.”"
