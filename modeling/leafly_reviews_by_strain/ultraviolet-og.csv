HerbeHeureuse,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1385911,"“Went to Glisan Buds to pick up one gram of Ultra Violet (flower) so that I could get the 25 cent donation joint. All the proceeds this week go to the victims of Orlando.

I'm on a quest to find the perfect indica, and Ultra Violet's description on Leafly says it provides "dreamy, sleepy euphoria". I gotta say this high is REALLY nice, and when I told the budtender that's what I wanted his eyes lit up. It's one of his...”"

ALEX3100,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1232342,"“Very uplifting for an indica strain.. No couch lock , another great strain for pain without the sleepy feeling”"
hkh5,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1296668,"“this strain doesn't make me as sleepy as  the description implies, but it is an amazing, "dreamy" high with almost psychedelic qualities. music is amazing on this strain. very minimal munchies also, which is always a huge plus. in higher doses it's good for sleep also.”"
stonerbusiness,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1251315,"“Very good for creating and motivation”"
IzzyMyers14,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1346672,"“Smoked a g from a bong and it was absolutely amazing! Felt like I was in a dream. Made me very hungry, eyes were very red and my mouth was very dry. but it tasted sweet. helped with my Scoliosis backpain as well and kept me very chill.”"
lushesgreens,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1322371,"“Got a quarter oz that was tested at 26% THC and .43%CBD. Smells very fruity and tastes like earth berry. Very nice relaxing high with giggles. Definitely feel some eye pressure though, probably smoking some stems lol. Great strain, definitely worth it^^”"

StickyDank420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1279141,"“Strain is amazing with a fruity put strong pungent smell.. In looks it's dense purple nugs full smell.. Smoke is incredible in a water pipe taking bowls it's a creeper high type feeling but relaxing high.. In taste it taste the way it smells fruity dank smell”"
lushesgreens,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1327217,"“Very nice strain I got from a buddy that works for Dope Magazine in Portland, OR. Very nice, happy high. Take a hit, before inhale swish the smoke in your mouth, then inhale fast and short then almost immediately exhale. When done, you can definitely taste the flower flavor, I'd say rose or lily, but DANKKK. When "regularly" smoked, taste is earthy, maybe some diesel? Overall, I'm high. Beautiful strain I would buy a...”"
Northern_Light,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1329274,"“As a stand alone, Ultraviolet OG is a great strain - a juicy, flavourful, purple indica. There's certainly nothing wrong with that! But it is outclassed by many of the top shelf kush strains that are just better at all the things that make UVOG what it is. If you like the dankness but don't want to be smashed over the head with a brick, like GDP, UVOG may be the strain for you.”"
yoshiya,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1272553,"“High :)

Dyermaker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1575579,"“I like this strain but not as an Indica. 

I had an extremely stressful morning on top of being sick so I dropped by my local shop to grab something that would help me rest and recuperate. After vaping it with my volcano I did feel a relief of some symptoms. Mostly uplifted but not at all sleepy or as deeply relaxed as I wanted.”"
matth141,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1208047,"“I might have got some bad batch. It's burning fast for me and the effects seem to be short.

It's great to study on though. It's also nice to fall asleep with. I would describe the high like having full control but like your mind is opening. You definitely relax a lot with it and get pretty introspective.

I've been smoking with a small bong. The experience really is not bad. It still can burn a little but I have had...”"

monstapuss,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ultraviolet-og/reviews/1326678,"“There's nothing I dislike about this heavy-handed indica!  It hits hard if you overmedicate tho😂!  Not as strong for pain, but it puts my ass to sleep! No better pain relief than sleep.  Love the taste, also. This good smoke.”"

Wasn't expecting a ton from this strain and was very pleasantly knocked on my ass. Will definitely be buying more!”"
