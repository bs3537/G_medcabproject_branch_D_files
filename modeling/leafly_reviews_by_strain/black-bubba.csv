The high, though, is great--very clear head, very heavy body. I then did transition into more of a heady high, though, which was a bit odd but I dug it anyway!”"
Cal5893,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-bubba/reviews/1412288,"“Black Bubba has a different aroma. It has a very mild coffee scent with a curious smell my nose can't quite pick out. We smoked it out of a bong. It has a very relaxed and  smooth hit. I was surprised at how calm it was inhaled. The effects of this strain include an intense cerebral high combined with a mild body high.”"

I smoked a few bong rips of this the other night before bed, and I was out for the count.  Super heavy indica.  Don’t smoke this when you have plans to be productive.”"

Batman418,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-bubba/reviews/1739545,"“Definitely has a smell like another strain, industrial plant, both very "earthy" with a slight blue cheese hint on the back. Taste almost of a piney dirt. Now the high... Great! All body with a little dizzy feeling for a bit then definitely gives you a bit of head high. Would "highly" recommend”"
