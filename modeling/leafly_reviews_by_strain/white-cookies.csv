JDriver,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1414310,"“My buddy kept telling me to pick this strain up. I thought it would be another over hyped cookie strain. This needs to be up there against blue cookies. The smell is like a. Sweet butter it smells fantastic. The look does not disappoint, COVERED in white glittering trichromes. The high was long and right on the eyelids but didn't make me sleepy. Once the stoney feeling settled in on came the euphoric sensation. This ...”"

dankguy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1413906,"“I reviewed smoking the bud of this strain a while back...

I feel I should recommend to any fans of this strain  to try the Keif of the Cookie ... it's a one-hit-hash-like-warm-pillow-like poomf in the face.”"

lemondeeststone,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1385672,"“The buds look like a pale girl scout cookie. The taste, the smell and the start of the high feeled like white widow. The start of the high is a touch racy but  the second half is relaxing (to me). The high is long lasting.”"
Raptorsnumberonefan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1410773,"“Very Smooth Definite creeper.. takes time to fully kick in 
extremely creative, energizing.... or at least  not tired mentally..
Slightly heady physical sensation.
Nice throat taste flavor.
Physical sense of euphoria throbbing vibrations.
Mental relaxed zoned out from the current situation or surrounding and thinking introspectively. 
Real beautiful for mental escape or nature gazing.
Very classy sativa LOL
Wavy feel...”"
RMI,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1450326,"“Indica dominant and therefore this strain is high in CBG, CBC, THCV with trace CBD. 

This strain is best grown outdoors for it to develop its full cannabinoids and terpenes in its trichomes. 

Harvest according to the effect you want, meaning to avoid couch lock harvest before trichomes are 35% amber

Strain is great for anxiety, making RSO for cancer, and just plain chilling”"
TooHigh303,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1420630,"“Beautiful strain. GSC plus WW made a baby out of this world. The taste is great. High is definitely worth talking about. Best way to describe it for me would be laying in the country, under the star filled sky, with no worries. You can count on this strain to numb your mind, without the sleepiness.”"
Ceidan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1395070,"“This strain is magical. Absolutely stunning weed. I'm couch locked and euphoric at the same time”"

cjbxo707,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1348365,"“Starts out very in your head, like a true sativa (others have said it starts like it's parent, white widow, but i haven't tried that so i don't have that reference point). After a while the indica high begins to set in, making for a very relaxing somewhat sedative body high. For me, I was awake and giggly.

Best oil I have got to date, giving a great profile of the strain. The oil has a very strong sweet odor with some very tell-tales white widow smells. My oil was definitely leaning toward the GSC phenotype. The taste from this oil was remarkably clean, with a sweet vanilla sugar cookie taste leading to a very pungent, hazy finish. No ha...”"

I smoked it immediately, due to pain, upon returning home and found it to be tasty and at first much like WW though 20 minutes or so in it morphed into a relaxing body high following into a munchies fest. It was decent and long lasting but not as good for pain as WW or many other strains I have used. Would I get it again? Probably not if...”"
FrendlyCanadian,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1410777,"“Earthy fruity sent my friend compared the earthy smell to the scent of tea. Very dense buds packed with rich trichrones. Smooth going in but catches your throat coming out. Very mellow euphroic high the starts in the highs and lingers theough out the body.”"
ericbeaver,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1376415,"“Great strain. I grew it out from some clones and had great results. Good body buzz with a rich flavour and appealing aroma. Showed some resistance to thrips that had been an issue with the other strains I had growing.”"

Azir,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1522010,"“It's an alright strain, It wasn't nearly as good as other strains I had and I got to try this for free, I would most likely not buy this strain myself, but I also don't horribly dislike it.”"
pouchy420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1539634,"“First time I grow and for a first, it came out a satisfying crop: with this sweet smell ;mix of butter and lemon pie, dishwasher soap. The taste is soft and easy in throat, really mellow buzz that takes couple of minutes to kick off. Started smoothly to ease my anxiety, made me feel relax then really happy, a little euphoric! Did not increase my cardiac rythmn which i dislike a lot. This is a quality strain: nice for...”"

SamDeli,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1369658,"“Although a well balanced hybrid for the most part, I felt a much more sedating sensation with mellowing after effects. Nice flavor and bud structure was crystalized light green with medium fragrance. B+ for this strain.”"
Shadowforcenick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cookies/reviews/1376775,"“White cookies is a great strain for pain relief and depression. I picked up a gram by dab society and didn't regret it. The smell has a sweet sugar cookie impression that finishes with a hazy, white widow note. Couldn't have been more impressed with the first terpy, sweet dab I took. After about 1/4 of my gram was gone I could really feel the uplifting and sedating effects (like... really). Overall would recommend, e...”"
