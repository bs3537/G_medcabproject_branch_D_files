OldLion,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/love-potion/reviews/1417453,"“I tried this because of the sexual reviews.. Well it does make you horny. After taking this I ended up having a 1 hour hard on, I smoked this alone, wanting just a calm relaxation, instead it made me want to have sex.. with no sex partner around I had to masturbate to online porn.”"
sammipear,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/love-potion/reviews/1398184,"“Wow. So my girlfriend and I bought this, completely not making the connection between the name and effects. Needless to say, it's done great things for both of our libidos. I take medications that decrease mine and it can make things tough while in a relationship. Love Potion #1 has definitely helped me. I also really enjoy how it makes me want to draw and play music. Some pretty cool portraits have come out of smoki...”"

Very euphoric! But when you come down 3 hours later expect to be very tired and aroused. Defiantly pick this up.”"
Kolendo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/love-potion/reviews/1415083,"“One of my favourites!!! Got to try some out of a sativa sample pack I purchased, Love Potion is just unreal. the buzz is smooth and creamy, mellow and creative, with a heavy dash of arousal. Definitely sex weed.”"
Sexyfit420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/love-potion/reviews/1418920,"“Ive anxiety and insomnia. Daytime sativas give me paranoia. Love potion is the the perfect mellow sativa hybrid for me. 

Complete focus, body just relaxed, muscle pain down, can smoke all day without getting sleepy. 

It smells and tastes great. 

It definitely makes me horny.

Minimum a gram needed if you wanna get high. 

For mellow daytime stress relief, highly recommend this strain”"

If you can get ahold of some of this Love Potion #1, you have accomplished a feat of hedonism. 
This strain is the pinnacle if you are searching for that 'getting in the mood' evening, morning, afternoon delight or when ever a strong wind blows.
No paranoia, just a sweet feeling of euphoria along with a nice pain and stress release. Definitely felt like dancing, writing po...”"

Really strong Sativa that is probably best left alone if you are not an experienced smoker.  It's powerful uplifting effects are quite intoxicating and euphoric.  It left me feeling quite happy.

Lovely pine, sweet lemon and hint of bitter grapefruit in the bag. Turns into a creamy lemon and lime sorbet on inhale in the vape (at around 180C). Such a tasty strain :D
