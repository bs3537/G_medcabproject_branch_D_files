beccabird,https://www.leafly.com/indica/oregon-diesel/reviews/1416276,"“Sweet, sweet relief. This strain vaulted me over the void. I was up in the clouds, but I could run around in the clouds! I was writing, I was designing, I was thinking. My depression lifted for the first time in 8 months. I was crying in relief, because I remembered who I was. I have no words. I wanted to kiss the feet of the acquaintance who gifted me a gram.
This is going to become a regular part of my fight agains...”"

A beautiful, powerful smell of sweet berry and lemon twirling over a strong undercurrent of diesel and a light mist of pine deliciousness. The smoke was smooth, slightly spicy going in and lightly fruity coming out.  Of my three favorite indica heavies, Agrijuana's Purple Kush, Chalice Farms' Blueberry Kush and  Harmony Farms' Kosher Kush (Love the 2 gram jar!) Ore...”"

Constant_StateOfMeep,https://www.leafly.com/indica/oregon-diesel/reviews/1412084,"“Decent for pain relief, perhaps not the best for inflammation though in my experience.  Immediately felt the head change, very mellow and uplifting.  Amazing for depression and mood.”"
Tyler22a,https://www.leafly.com/indica/oregon-diesel/reviews/1312684,"“Wow....I was not ready for this super chill, relaxed strain. To be honest I was a bit skeptical but wow, almost 15 minutes after vaping it in my Arizer solo.... I feel like melted liquid butter soaking into a muffin. 

Love it”"
Musa1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/oregon-diesel/reviews/1416284,"“RX in Stockton has an amazing strain of this. A few hits of this before bedtime and insomnia is no match. Odi what we call "FIRE" in the 209.”"
scizzorhash69,https://www.leafly.com/indica/oregon-diesel/reviews/1495849,"“Very, VERY pungent smell and taste. Sweet and floral. I found the effects came shortly after smoking a nice bowl after work. REALLY relaxing high, not to the point to where I personally was tired, but just enough to where I felt like I was "Right in the pocket bud". Very much helped the diabetic nerve pain that I experience daily in my feet and lower back. 
Very enjoyable, giggly, and very relaxing experience.

PMP,https://www.leafly.com/indica/oregon-diesel/reviews/1416285,"“Very much like Sour Diesel, so good for depression and anxiety.   The results are a little longer lasting then most.”"

lushesgreens,https://www.leafly.com/indica/oregon-diesel/reviews/1466195,"“Such a beautiful strain. Real pungent of diesel, pine and a little berry. High is real relaxing and euphoric, definitely a nice strain before bed. Batch I got was a little fluffy, but have had some before that was hard as a rock! burns great either way, not the kind I would grind though. Suggest for anyone looking for relaxation, euphoria, pain relief, lack of appetite and of course depression ✌️🌲”"
Remedy394,https://www.leafly.com/indica/oregon-diesel/reviews/1557449,"“Oregon Diesel is a quiet gem. Beautiful buds (w/ gorgeous purple hues) and a sweet scent as calming as the high - I found her to be a bit of a creeper. With a soothing and refreshing high, it's  great for anxiety and eventually lends itself to a great night's sleep. The more I use this strain, the more I appreciate it. Definitely a favorite for treating insomnia.”"

The taste of the hitskis: very nice (not fruity, interestingly), and smooth.
The effects: only positive. This weed won't glue you to the couch; the ratio of this indica dominant hybrid feels like about 60% Indica to 40% Sativa. There is enough Sativa to keep you moving, but you'll be doing your thing serenely, and without even a hint of any edge.
