It seems like it would be a heavily sedating medication yet my experience with this strain is that is isn't very strong at all. ChemDawg or Sour Diesel will bring you all the effects of Dopium and many more. I don't particularly care for this strain, but that being said it is great for beginners! It tastes piney and earthy but not...”"

Amazing for pain and stress with a great euphoric, relaxing, talkative high. Uplifting and relaxing for anyone who has had a stressful day and is looking to let the stress go. Very helpful with body aches and insomnia if you have problems sleeping.”"

WestAmericans,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dopium/reviews/1334105,"“I wasn't crazy about Dopium initially -- it felt anxiety-inducing because I was expecting it to be more of a downer, but had I been in the mood for a Sativa, it probably would have turned out fine. I gave it another chance in the daytime and found it to be one of the most creative strains I have tried in a while. For that reason alone, I'd mark it as a favorite.”"
hawkski86,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dopium/reviews/1348913,"“this is strange due to the fact that I have th his strain in wax form and it's advertised as INDICA. This particular strain I have has a strong relaxing affect both physical and mental. I use this as a night time strain for help with sleeping. very good burning qaulity at 84.06 thca.  love the strain I have and the concentrate form.”"
