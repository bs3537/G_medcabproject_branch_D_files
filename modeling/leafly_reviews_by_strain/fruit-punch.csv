zobudd,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/fruit-punch/reviews/1396644,"“Fruit Punch was my very first "non-bagseed" grow!!!! Kept her in my rotation for years now through clones.  A very sturdy, upright/skinny-christmas-tree in shape and needs to be trimmed and trained indoors.  (note: bending of stems needs to start early because she'll start to become very rigid at about 4 wks)  Will have some natural purple on stems an leaf petioles.  Very forgiving strain for beginners.

Nice lift! Doesn't make you sleepy or out you in couch lock. It helped me with my pain down to the deepest level and then, lifted my spirits.

Though, i felt a little anxious and maybe a bit paranoid but that could also be due to smoking a bit too much. Perfect to use if you need energy or just during day time. It will have you smelling it every 5 min.”"

I had assumed it was an indica before looking it up. It made my boyfriend and I both VERY lethargic.

Sex was really good on it initially, but then following that, we've been too lethargic to even approach each other for sex, lol. 

The comedown just left us very depressed and angry.

The first thing that will hit when you lay eyes on this bud is it's powerful fruity scent of various sweet aromas that, surprisingly enough, give off a scent similar to a fruit salad.
