MOSTdopeDIESEL,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-milkshake/reviews/1303393,"“Great looking buds. Didn't think it was quite as fruity as the description say but still a fantastic bud. Perfect for concerts, keeps you in the moment by not spacing you out too much but extremely relaxing feeling.”"

Gives you the feeling 2mg of zyanex does. Definitly not a parnoid feeling the whole time your high. Warning tho it is a creeper”"
