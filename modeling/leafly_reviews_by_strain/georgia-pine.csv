Great for social events or chillin with friends. Novices be weary, quick and heavy head trip. Not for the newb.”"

I picked up a gram and I wish I would have gotten more. it's beautiful. nice frosty green buds with orange/amber hairs. The first scent is a pine type smell but there is also a watermelon fruity aroma as well. Definitely a beautiful bud and will be on the hunt for more! 😍”"

This strain definitely has a pine-tastic aroma, accompanied by fairly fast acting heady effects along with a nice relaxing body high to ease away pain.

In my opinion it smokes like a Blue Dream variant and should become a fairly popular strain for individuals wanting relief while maintaining functionality.”"
