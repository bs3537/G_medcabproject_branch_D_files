The flowering period was agonizingly long. However, I think it was worth the wait now that it's done. The plant  produced very large buds, and the high is a great energetic, sativa-like high that is hard to find in auto-flowering varieties. It really does have a subtle fuel scent, but doesn't taste like chemi...”"

This strain gives off a wonderful fuel-like aroma and really packs a punch.

Lurking in the genetic make up of Short Stuff Seeds Russian Rocket Fuel is a monster

This is an auto-flowering strain”"

Yield is close to 2 ounces per plant.  extreme high that lasts long.  This is an auto dwarf that is easy to grow with a decent yield and high is awesome.  Great for stealth growers as mine get to 18'' every time.”"

I was lucky enough to come across a couple of seeds in the the last ounce that I got and was wondering why my plants are growing so slow when it says here that it only takes 8-10 weeks, but after reading the review that stated it took 5 months for the plant to mature I'm not quite so worried now. For the quality of this strain, I can have the patience it requires”"

Sweet / Diesel / Earthy taste led to a bad case of dry mouth so have something to drink to alleviate the dryness !! 

Smoke is mild thru a small hitter and very milder thru a water pipe .. Head high that will bring out creativity .. with a mild body high attached that alliviate...”"
