It is awesome for insomnia/night time anxiety sufferers, or those who just can't shut off their thoughts/stressful head. Once I Take a few tokes of this stuff I'm ready to lay down.

Right after hitting purple passion I feel a tingly  sensation that rises straight to my head, but then slowly dies down to my body. And once after, I take another it,...”"

My first purple was Purple Nepal, but Passion takes the award for "Holy sweet Guan Yin that might as well be a fucking amethyst." Absolutely covered in a royal purple color and frosty crystals unlike anything I've seen. And the scent was like a pungent, perfume-like mix of rose and lavender. You almost couldn't even feel the smoke going down, it was that mellow on your lungs. The sugar a...”"

Definitely a indica lovers type of strain . 

I don’t smoke much of it before a shift . It has a slight euphoric body tingle to it... usually eating right away , reverses the “paranoid high” feeling . 

My buds didn’t look as p...”"
