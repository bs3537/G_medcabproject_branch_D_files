darthvaperrr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/platinum-gsc/reviews/1414110,"“Super duper dense, almost impossible to crush a nug between two fingers. Had a gorgeous coating of crystals so large you could see them without even squinting, it was amazing. The high had a nice body stone, whilst sending my mind to a different planet. A very psychoactive strain, potent to the Nth degree. A winner.”"

So, I swung by my new favorite dispensary in SilverLake(Los Angeles), CA.  I wanted a Jack strain, which I got(Jack the Ripper), but noticed this strain Platinum Cookies.  Now I have had GSC , GSC mint thins, and Platinum Bubba, platinum OG and probably some more variations.  I have always been pleased,...”"

I started really smoking about six months ago, after 30 years of smoking every few months or so.  Never really enjoyed it, either.  Then I saw Super High Me, and the voting came around to legalize it here in Washington State, so I decided to give it another try.

During this last six mont...”"

The smell is a sweet earthing pungent dank with a hint of mint, and the buds are larger than your average plant. The high hits fast and hard! Would almost compare to a hit of honey oil. (Was high off honey before trying the Pgsc and still hit hard and got me noticeably higher right away) Not recommended fo...”"

It is uplifting, yet doesn't make you "on alert" like a meerkat the way some strains do. It is also not one to make you too physically relaxed that you can't get up to go to the fridge for some munchie food, which this strain definitely causes you to want to do. I found that I think philosophically ...”"
