BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-maui/reviews/1362419,"“This is such a nice sativa.  Made for a very productive day, it's a strain that will make you want to be out in the sun.  The taste of sour tropical candy will fill your mouth with every exhale.  The buds are very dense and heavily trichomed, honestly they're pleasing in every way possible.  Definitely worth picking up.”"

pooplad,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-maui/reviews/1369132,"“Wow... All I can say is wow. This strain is very exciting. The sour Maui is a very dense plant. It took a solid 5 min before you can feel a huge wave go over your body. Its very powerful, but the great thing is it's not as though any person can't handle the plant. Sour Maui definitely works with whatever level of smoking you do. It's perfectly smooth and very long lasting. I would say I maintained a peak level for a ...”"

SmokeYourGirlsPantsOff,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-maui/reviews/1263441,"“I seriously enjoyed this strain. Perfect for an afternoon chill down after a long day. Easy to break down but wouldn't grind bc it's very brittle. Great exotic smell and taste. Great for stress. Smoke this!”"
IGgigglebushcentral,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-maui/reviews/1515849,"“by far the best strain I have had in a long time. a couple bong rips and I don't even know how I am typing thing. flavor is absolutely amazing and leaves a great aftertaste. I have already went to 711 4 times within 30 minutes so it definitely gives you an appetite. I suggest getting all your stuff before hand. not because it is couch locking, just because the high is so good you just want to focus on it and enjoy it...”"

kokopatron,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-maui/reviews/1194701,"“One of my favorite Sativas; Sour Maui has a quick clean come-up and a breezy head high with a delicate lifted body. This is a thinker, a checklister, a spring cleaner; enjoy this high with a lightly-clouded 22C and a salty breeze on a 50cc motorbike.

Four stars because the odor and flavor leave a lot to be desired. I'd like to see the light-high qualities pushed a bit richer and then hybridize with something super w...”"

Now, the smell in this strain is very smooooooooooooth, sweet, and very "tropical" like. The buds looked good too. The taste is exactly how it smells and you can definitely taste the smoothness and the tropical like fruits from this strain. As for the high and how it differs? Well, a lot of Sativas giv...”"

DJChronic,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-maui/reviews/1297271,"“This is another great strain that is expanding my love of good sativas. Very smooth hitting head high that settles slowly into a chill body high. The euphoric head high persists, leading to giggles and talkativeness, although staying on a single topic was a challenge! Nicely long lasting, munchies , and a very slow come down. Another nice benefit was excellent pain relief. Good strain!”"
