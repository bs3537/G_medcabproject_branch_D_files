woodymac420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1379527,"“My first hit I was high. The one thing I've noticed is that it makes a difference on how you smoke what your smoking. There are some strains that hit harder in the bong and others I'd prefer in my glass blunt. VooDoo hits hard in the bong and lasts a very long time. We had two bowls during the day over a 12 hour period of time and we remained high. It was a great feeling that lasted all day. Thanks to my new peeps ...”"

Coming across quality thai strains are like christmas for me, and this is like that one "big" present hidden behind the tree just when you think you didn't get what you "really" wanted that year. Its that good. Thai (purple, I hear) x AK47. Seriously a kick to the head that has every orifice in your head dripping but in that, "good god, this is what cannabis should be like" sort of way. VERY heavy, very intense...”"
deeptrax,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1351549,"“I had smoked this a few times from a pipe and got a satisfying all-around high, but three hits from a bong gave me the strongest head high I have ever experienced, and I'm a near daily smoker. We used hemp wick to light it and tasted pungent, spicy, and buttery notes. It gave me a full head rush that made me feel like my retinas had laser beams coming out of them, but not in an uncomfortable way.”"
Munin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1389119,"“I have to say: WOOOW!  This is one beautiful strain, or this is one freaking fantastic Voodoo batch.  Either way, I can only hope to communicate the distant dispair I feel for everyone who doesn't get to enjoy this little wonder.

Exquisitely euphoric, Voodoo packs the loveliest wallop this side of Girl Scout Cookies.  Sitting produces a bit of a couch lock for me, but once I'm standing and walking the stimulating sa...”"
ckang19,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1386759,"“I got 5gs and I put a bit in my pipe and I was gone I am a frequent smoker so no I'm not a beginner, gives a great body high and makes you chill out, (but smoke too much I can barely see my phone screen to see what I texted) I'd say smoke this in the morning before starting your day. I would say this is definitely in my top 10”"
arahstoney,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1256354,"“I must admit the first time I smoked this strain I had it out of a 50z bong, one of the worst experiences of my life, I got overly high  and this was when I constantly smoking. it was not a pleasent experience, it was extremely strange and to this day I will not smoke voodoo in anything besides a joint.”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1385641,"“Personal favourite, must be the terpenes or something but this strain is ideal for those who would like to control their mental pains.”"
Petaloutha,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1359466,"“The listing here says no Voodoo in the Colorado Springs area. Strawberry Fields carries Voodoo Star, a hybrid that is amazing and wonderful. Always a favorite at our house.”"
Immersify,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1256358,"“The smell is a strong apricot aroma, and the buds are dense with olive-green bud and red hairs. The smoke is sweet and nutty on the inhale, and spicy (think black pepper) on the exhale. It gets kind of harsh toward the end of the bowl so keep a drink handy. Uplifting, energizing, and empowering describe this strain's effects, and the experience is pleasant as a whole, though I would not recommend to those who are sen...”"
wezbian,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1256356,"“wow! I love this strain, I get a nice relaxed feeling as well as being alert. stress and depression go up in smoke  with voodoo. definitely in my top 5 strains”"
VoodooPrincess,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1334092,"“Voodoo is incredible- I read an article about what strains were best for enhancing sex and it said that Voodoo was the best strain for a three some. Which was funny because we were having our first three some and that's why I was looking. I decided to try it out in the hot tub before our #3 arrived and it instantly turned me into a maniac!  I had my husband pinned up against the side of the hot tub and had non stop o...”"

snaffasnaff,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1483305,"“10 minutes after smoking this strain I realized why it was named voodoo. I felt my face like a mask (like voodoo masks) and i was flying through the street (I was walking on that moment).
10 voodoo masks / 10”"

ninjagoblinsahntah,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1358681,"“have JAMAICAN voodoo....
medium munchies
smell and smoke taste are rum and teriyaki jerk
aftertaste is strawberries and bananas

helped me with a panic and probably insomnia soon”"
jisu416,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1318107,"“Used in Shatter form. Excellent uplifting feeling that made me very talkative without stumbling over my words....I am quiet person otherwise. Made me focused, enrgetic and happy as well....usually sativas make me jittery (e.g. green crack shatter). I used it before playing ice hockey and had a very good game...will be stocking up on this one.”"

bropamine,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1256353,"“Bought an eighth of this strain of wax at a dispensary out in the Lansing area. Very strong cerebral effects, very noticeable in the top of your spine. The overall quality of the wax was great and had me feeling very productive and sociable. Tolerance builds very quickly when it comes to sativa strains for me however, so I would recommend alternating this with other strains to keep the effects fresh and evident.”"
SpookyPuppy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1234802,"“Voodoo is a nice waker upper, Smoked from glass perc bong it was so smooth and barely any coughing. Went out and worked 8 hours after a few bowls and was good for the day. Not the best sativa but still really great :)”"

Fell asleep too early”"

GrassLab,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1655377,"“I've built up a pretty strong over time and have found myself leaning towards Indicas, although I try any new strain I come across - once I can.

Voodoo was quite the unexpected and I mean it in a good way. After the first toke, I immediately felt a pressure behind my eyes. As the blunt kept making its rounds around the circle, I found myself sinking deeper and deeper into the couch. My usually racing mind suddenly b...”"

ErosKing,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1374324,"“Wow has that spicy,earthy taste of a classic strain.  uplifting, yet relaxing. kinda trippy. between 3 people, we all had a different effects. hard to explain, Voodoo Chile is the variety I'm reviewing about.”"
CanIHaveAHitOfThat,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1273504,"“This strain tastes strongly of Irish Spring soap and hay. It's not a smooth smoke at all and it'll make you cough. However, a few minutes after taking 2 hits, I feel hard, chronic pressure that goes in a band around my head easing. That's a huge relief, honestly. It may be a sativa, but I'm smoking it at 1 am. It's working. I'm glad I bought several ounces. It's good medicine.”"
Bwnayy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1647906,"“Voodoo is the only strain of weed I've tried that I haven't liked. It did give me a euphoric (but anxious) high, at first. Then on the comedown I felt like complete shit, depressive and a little numb. It's like the short high drained all the happiness from the rest of my day. My friends didn't have the same thoughts though, they really liked it for the most part but personally I probably wouldn't smoke it again.”"
BangingDrums69420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1749972,"“Favorite Sativa to date! Had my head in a spell! 😂 Super uplifting, really does curb depression, good morning smoke! 10/10 would practice this witchcraft again! 😂”"
Chadd720,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1553882,"“Tried this strain in sauce! It was a great clean, great tasting strain. Definitely a sativa sauce that’ll try again.. had a balanced high the entire time. Hit me more like a hybrid than straight sativa”"
CaliCare,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1802595,"“This is an amazing uplifting strain that is very precise in keeping your high activated throughout a pretty long period of time. There is no drag after you are sober, leaving you with a very delightful feeling.”"

Hebendemerp,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1723091,"“It was an intense high, but I'm prone to anxiety so the trips can get really scary and the paranoia can get really intense. I ended up crying lol People with anxiety disorders be careful but other than that enjoy.”"
BamfXBlazer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1367423,"“Effects come on almost instantly after a big rip of Voodoo out of my Bubbler, along with a nutty, almost spicy taste. The buds are frosty, smell mystic, and give you an extremely euphoric high for 3+ hours! Definitely one of my new favorites!”"

After smoking outside, we went back upstairs to the area we were renting via AIRBNB. This was a very uplifting, giggly, foggy high. This high just made me want to chill on the couch. I vividly remember trying to unscrew the cap on my already unscrewed water bottle, and struggling to even drink water. But, this strain made m...”"

I laughed n continued to laugh all night just thinking of things in my life that were 😆 funny! I know it sounds crazy but it was much fun, sometimes laughing can help in so many ways!  Helps with pain, anxiety, ptsd, depression ❤️❤️  My favorite ever had in 40 years!”"
leaflygary,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1253502,"“Just tried Voodoo-
One light puff on my Vap Pen and I was very quickly feeling the effects. I agreed with most of the manufacturer's notes on this strain, but so disagree with their opinion on the negatives - I thought the dry mouth was a 6 (scale 1-10), the dry eyes a 3 and I feel no paranoid tendencies. 
Very good!”"
trulyangel,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/voodoo/reviews/1457075,"“This strain is great for daytime use. I was clear headed and totally capable of getting things done but be warned it may give you slight anxiety if you smoke too much so it would be best to take it slow on this strain. Overall it's pretty good. Wouldn't say it's the best I've had but it's definitely a good one.”"

Very euphoric, uplifting, will give you the tinglies and a long lasting creeper. The phenotype I got to try from The Joint By Cannabis in Denver is 80/20 indica dominant hybrid, so im not sure how they got a 100% sativa landrace to this but however they did it, it sure is an elite herb.”"
