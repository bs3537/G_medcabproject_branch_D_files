Let's Get into this.
Bud Structure: Super compact like a small little cola the way it foxtails towards the top and those fine dark mossy green leafs some bright green in other parts of the bottom bud a darker green love the purple boulders here in there. 
The Smell: Super sweet like fresh fruit...”"
LyricalBlack,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1387729,"“There are two things that you must do when you have this. one is wake, the second is bake. this is a great smoke to get you through the day but be careful. the high for this comes out of no where and it doesn't go after your head first like most weed does, if you think its soft just wait 5 minutes, you'll quickly find out why its the Man version of girl scout cookies”"
pnwcush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1409995,"“When I heard of Boy Scout cookies I was kinda worried they named it like this just to get hype about a strain that wasn't very good. Boy was I wrong. This is an amazing indica, probably the best I've ever had. Love the relaxing effects this has. Tastes sugary and earthy.”"

McSplif,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1487598,"“love is love love.  love is love love.   This one is a new personal favorite.   Super tasty. Beyond delicious. Uber sticky-icky dense nugs of super pungent smoke.   Grabbed this on recommendation of the bud tender at my local dispensary and wow. Most certainly will be grabbing more! If you have a chance to try this one properly done don't hesitate.   Its amazing.   Tastes like a cross between the dankest bubba you've...”"
soaringsoul,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1260552,"“This has been a favorite, by far. As a novice smoker (myself) and 'experienced' smoker (my significant other), we both thoroughly enjoyed this hybrid strain, indica dominant. We started out by smoking just a little bit, waited to see what the effects would be, and smoked a bit more. We were laughing and enjoying ourselves immensely. Which was then followed by relaxation and fell into a dreamy sleep. Highly recommend ...”"
BlazingGlory420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1393699,"“Boy Scout Cookies....so good. This is one of my favorite strains by far! From what I recall, it's GSC x Bubba Kush. Definately has indica undertones, if you're prone to drowsiness be careful, this one could make it tough to function. I'm an indica fan, so this is a great mix of body buzz and euphoric heady feel. I can still form full sentences and think clearly thanks to the GSC too. When I was getting it on the regu...”"

CapeLadyTokes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1789537,"“The best “before bed” weed I’ve ever had.  Incredible full-body experience that can last for hours.  Makes any pain turn to tingles.  Couch and movie time, for sure!One of my absolute favorites!”"
klw34,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1321690,"“Feeling mellow as fuck. No paranoia (I'm not a person that weed always makes paranoid. Pretty consistent with the majority's experience). Just super content and happy. Reminds me of how wonderful Blue Cookie made me feel. This shit is crazy great. Haven't found a strain that made me feel this happy in a long time.”"

jabbathepot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1344700,"“Boy Scout Cookie smells peppery to me, and left it very hard to maintain a train of thought. Not good for writing! Moderate relief of pain and nausea, but I didn't feel overly sleepy. Also, my mood wasn't as uplifted as I'd hoped.”"
BrandonMakesBeats92,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1514750,"“Compare to GSC where it slowly starts. This BSC is more of a creep high. I will say its enjoyable whether your playing video games. Out with Friends. Be careful and have a drink with you. 🔥”"
Dominick16,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1178883,"“Great smoke! Amazing flavor, earthy and sweet. Tested at %20! Euphoric and balanced high with small to moderate doses but sleepiness increases with dose. Great day and night time smoke!”"

bachsalot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1177981,"“Musky, skunky taste. Heady high comes on strong, almost dissociative. Relaxing, but not oppressive. Heady feeling is followed by milder body high.”"
brizendine1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1306890,"“I love Boy Scout cookies it tastes and smells so wonderful that I just cannot get enough of it. it's very hard to find. and the high from it is just unbelievable it makes you talk a lot and makes you socialize it's just a really good feeling”"
mrobadamus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bsc/reviews/1327061,"“Purchased from World of Weed. 
Flower: like most cookie strains, it is very photogenic. One of my nugs from this batch was 4 grams and I had to stop and admire how colorful and prefect it was. Then I ripped that bitch apart and loaded the bong.
Smell: skunky. pungent and sweet. 
Crumble: fluffy and voluminous once ground up. Certainly feels like you get more for your money when it fluffs in the grinder. 
Burn: Great....”"

Taste is ok , kinda woodsy and plant like with a little sweetness. The high is super heavy. 3 or 4 dabs of BSC will help me get to sleep. Only reason it didn't get a 5 is the flavor wasn't insanely terpy .”"
