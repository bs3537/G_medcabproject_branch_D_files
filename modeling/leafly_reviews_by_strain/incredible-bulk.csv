Incredible Bulk

Mandangleow,https://www.leafly.com/indica/incredible-bulk/reviews/1385541,"“Veg-Bushy
Bloom-Stretch x 3 so she does well with topping and LST. Nutrient and Cal/Mag beast. Very resilient to heat and mites. Run heavy silica in order to keep branches from snapping under the weight of heavy buds. This girl is a pleasure to grow. Finishes in 8 weeks strong. 
Smoke-Very dense bud structure with high resin formation. Great medicinal smoke for pain management and night time relaxing. 

I grew 5 from...”"

I took a smallish bud and smoked it in my 43 year old pipe, (that's another story which I will share if anyone is interested), and my first impression is the smoothness of the exhale.  As I work through the bowl, the tender treatment on the mouth throat and lungs continues.

I listening to...”"

I have been able to experience this beautiful strain from seed to harvest. It has been a very easy and carefree plant to grow. I was amazed by the sheer size of the seed, which also germinated within 3 days.

I switched it early and have provided some really stunning photos of it at certain stages during flower. 

During the final week of flush the purple hints of colour came through and...”"

1 Week after harvest! 

I dried the flower on a drying rack for 3 days in a 1.3m x 2m room, I ran 2 20l dehumidifiers. 

On the 4th day I collected the fresh flowers and lay them in a air tight container and filled it to 1/5 of the height and don't lay them on top of each other. I air dry for 4 to 5 days after this and leave the case open most nights in a ventilated room. 

The smell is really starting to d...”"
TheToastedToker420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/incredible-bulk/reviews/1334914,"“Not much more to explain with these trees. As the name suggests, you will find your self struggling to handle these incredibly bulky, dense, furry fucking nuggets. Take out one nug and you'll inhale a wiff of a Sourish pine scent but altogether a more pungent skunk odor is produced. Taste like a skunk would, but gets right to the point when that smoke (or vapor) hits your lungs...

JboneAK,https://www.leafly.com/indica/incredible-bulk/reviews/1375451,"“I often times post two reviews, the first one being initial impression, and the second will usually be a day or two layer after really getting to spend time with the particular strain. In the case of Incredible Bulk, I've been smoking this for about a week now and got a pretty good idea what it's about. 

First off, the big bud genetics are obvious in the nuggets I got. Actually, they're more like grenades some of em...”"

Musky but not pungent, more woody than any strain i've tried so far like wood skunk and a tree fruit. Smells of Honey and Sweet Tea exactly like that!

twin2asaurus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/incredible-bulk/reviews/1373394,"“Best strain I've tried. Easy grow, large yield with huge buds that are very dense, relaxes and relieves pain when smoked. I have severe PTSD and neck and back pain with constant back spasms and sciatica. Within 15 minutes after smoke and vape session I realized my back had relaxed and I felt at peace, as my pain and anxiety were gone. SUPER effects that resulted in my best night of sleep in a long time.”"
HomeGrownDepot,https://www.leafly.com/indica/incredible-bulk/reviews/1425724,"“Early Saturday morning bowls & cartoons is the perfect combination for this strain. This stain will give you the perfect chill buzz, but won't leave you stoned and sunk into the couch, I like that. No paranoia, or headache. It's almost perfect for me. The reason it gets a 3/5 is because it was a bit difficult for me to grow, which may partially be my fault. It was out of control! lol. I simply could not contain it it...”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/incredible-bulk/reviews/1578038,"“Incredible Bulk"s OK. I'm pretty baked but had a 300mg edible, I did 3 dabs of IB and I feel a heavy body buzz, I'm even fighting to keep my eyelids open.  Keep an eye out for my 2nd review, it's after I've dabbed the whole half gram.
I can hopefully give more of an accurate description in the second review.
So sleepy....”"

RockyRaccoon16,https://www.leafly.com/indica/incredible-bulk/reviews/1337979,"“For $9/gram, an incredible deal and a decent strain. The bud is visually appealing in terms of color and consistency, and the smoke is not too harsh. I certainly felt "downing" effects ranging from relaxation, body euphoria, and perhaps a tad sleepy (but far from overpowering)... But these effects did not last that long. I think this would be a great end-of-the-day strain and a fair price would be $10/gram or less.”"
