The taste is very sweet and is also reminiscent of oranges with a floral undertone. Produces a very nice head high that keeps you feeling alert and aware. This is probably one of my favorite strains.”"

I use medically and daily and this was by far the best weed i have ever had. I need and eight ASAP. Had the amazing Tangie flavor with that hint of earthy and sweet from the GSC. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.”"

The effects are very cerebral meaning you will be on task; it might not be the right task but you'll be on it! It's reasonably effective as a pain reliever but that's on the low end.”"
