aeritano,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-kush/reviews/1417522,"“Great Stain!

Be warned: you will get munchies and become stupidly lazy. 

Smoked a bowl with a couple of friends,.. ended up going through 4 XL pizzas, content with relaxing on couch and watching stupid random movies and enjoying them. (Kentucky Fried chicken). 

Its really easy to pass out after smoking this strain. Knocked us all out, woke up hungry as hell.

Do not recommend smoking in the morning or afte...”"

I find that it's harder and harder these days to find a pure Indica, without some hybridized effects. Just totally hits my body at first I don't notice it at all. Then all of sudden I noticed I am relaxed, if you want that 60's vibe of all peace and no war this is a pure representation of that moment frozen in time. Afgh...”"

Zaren97,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-kush/reviews/1413435,"“Afghan kush is a very strong high and kind of catches you by surprise if you are not prepared. Being the fact that it is a kush gives it points on the potency chart anyway but other than that this strain is extremely potent rating a 19% to 22% Thc content. This strain gives an extreme body high would be strongly recommended for experts not for novices because those who are not prepared or have never had anything this...”"

Not harsh on the lungs and is a great strain to roll into a joint. Beginners should be careful however, it is a very heavy strain and 2-3 hits will do you good.”"
onerebelbuddha,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-kush/reviews/1371405,"“This indica is true with the indica traits. Horney. Hungry.  Sleepy. Even the head spins are foggy, tight around the cerebral with a low and heavy feeling. Shizits no joke. I love it.”"

For people with a lower tolerance, this is definitely a "hit it and quit it" type strain. Zero raciness whatsoever, and your whole body from head to toe just gets engulfed in this almost dream-like state of relaxation and laziness. Grea...”"

That is generally what I prefer. I actually thought this strain was a Sativa, (the first time I smoked it), such was the strength of the "heady" high. This was absolutely one of the most potent strains I have ever partaken of. The bud itself produces more kief than any other I have grinder up. I have sworn by S...”"
420Autoimmuner,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-kush/reviews/1393539,"“This is my favorite indica for stress hands down.  The pain relief is more like prescription ibuprofen,  but the euphoria is outstanding.  Afghan Kush is the "wash away the day" strain, or for spending the evening with your lover.   Substitute this for alcohol and you have a mellow, uplifting,  relaxing way to help your mind and body cope with stress!”"

Because of this, I have been searching for a med that will "knock my ass out" and allow me to sleep, as at times my brain doesn't want to slow down enough to allow me to relax.  Well....

I have had this strain many years ago, but this is the first time acquiring it on a medical quality.

RandysMan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-kush/reviews/1374421,"“Afghan Kush just lives up to its reputation. When I'm around friends I become very talkative. One down side is that this strain is one of the most effective strains at reducing my short term memory down to the point where whatever is the "shiniest" thing in the room is usually gets my full attention. Its body and especially head buzz is great, not too crazy, but last for a long time... Some times feels like it intens...”"

I finish my homework in my class and I was pretty calm all the time, it`s an outstanding kind for people with ADD/ADHD cause you are very focused and you feel ready to work.

I bought 10 grams and couldn't be more pleased. it does keep me on my ass though which makes meditation a long lasting beautiful dream. I really felt at ease all day. at times I found myself in a giggly mood. the munchies weren't that bad for me honestly it was kind of mind over matter.

AntonioCoolio,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-kush/reviews/1761514,"“A good strain for the evening if consumed in moderate ammounts. Bin Laden Kush as its also called, will kick in relatively slowly at first but then will hit hard. This strain is really bad if youre trying to focus. I recommend this if you just wanna feel care free and if you dont have any tasks at hand. Overall a very good strain for weekend afternoons.”"

I dont smoke as often as Iuse to and tried this to get a good sleep. ended up keeping me awake a bit longer then i wanted to be. i got a pretty outrageous cough and dry mouth that i couldnt shake.
