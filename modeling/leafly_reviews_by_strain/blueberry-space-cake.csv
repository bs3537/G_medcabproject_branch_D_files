Initially I just got a small buzz and thought I got swindled. About 10 minutes in, I feel like I'm on a cloud and everything from my lower back down to my feet are nice and tingly.”"

A bit on the darker orange/sienna side, though clear enough to read through, this highly stable shatter hits clean with minimal residue even at low dabbing temperatures. An obscure chord of ...”"

If you’re having trouble sleeping look no farther, but be careful if you’ve got stuff to do do.  If you’re looking for something similar that isn’t quite so sedating, alien duchess is a great choice.  It’s pretty apparent that alien duchess is one of this strains patent plants.  The euphoria from the alien strains comes through strong despite ...”"

hollahollapoopdolla,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blueberry-space-cake/reviews/1628286,"“My first strain from Pennsylvania. They are a newly legal state, and you can taste it in this Live Resin cartridge. While potent, the taste of butane outweighs the terpene profile.  I would have enjoyed this strain more if it were in the Rosin form.  I am looking forward to seeing this company perfect their extraction methods.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blueberry-space-cake/reviews/1722883,"“OK strain. mostly just tasty. 
anyone notice somehow the two sativa parents created an indica?  Outer space & alien dutchess are straight sativas.
I definitely think it's more of a sativa leaning hybrid, it is relaxing but I get no couch lock. 
The taste is reminiscent of Outer Space, it has that candy taste to it. 
It's worth a try, especially at only $65 a gram.
just don't look to this supposed indica for insomnia ...”"

I’ve tried it multiple times to make sure it wasn’t a one time issue, but continued to happen. If you deal with anxiety I would not recommend this strain.”"
