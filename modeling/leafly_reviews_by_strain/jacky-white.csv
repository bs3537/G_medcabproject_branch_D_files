=============
softbullets,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1370619,"“This is an awesome sativa dominant hybrid. Uplifting fun high and good for my pain. From someone who usually steers clear of sativas.”"
MeandPTSD,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1360865,"“I wish it gave me more energy instead of physical calmness.  I might be one of the few who does best with a 100% sativa  though.”"
JohnAdrenaline,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1356739,"“Very uplifting and socializing strain. Also acts in the body causing some relaxation. Tastes is good and the smoke is smooth. The yield was above the average.”"
sviauz06,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1356742,"“Sweet, citrusy, tropical flavours and she tastes just like she smells. Very pleasant smoke, with a mild sting on exhale to let ya know she means business. Very euphoric, visual high with a mild burnout. Can be intense in higher quantities. One of the more enjoyable sativas for me.”"
MrFuzz420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1373503,"“Jack White is fire!!!!!!! 

Gives off that euphoric feeling from the Jack Herer side of it. Talkative strain and keeps you energized. Definitely a strain that gives you the giggles. 


I like this strain and the taste is very pungent which I don't mint. It's a strain you can use night or day

danielricelighting,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1356741,"“This strain is fantastic. Sativa people will love it, very happy and uplifting.. Stress and anxiety disappear.”"
shaymurr,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1377964,"“Honestly I am prone to depression and anxiety and I rarely feel euphoria when high (I used to be addicted to opiate pills and nothing compares to that "happy" fake high). This gives me a happy high which is rare and hard for me to find but I feel actually happy on this strain. Yes.”"
RonsHigh,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1373060,"“This is my most favourite and most loved strain ever. My workouts are complete with this strain. My life feels complete with jacky.”"
dankler,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1356740,"“Very easy to grow. Likes to stretch her legs very far. will out grow a large tent if not placed into veg early. taste great and a very big yielder.”"

So this is that kind of weed that is so smooth you can suck in big chestfuls without a burn. Mild taste. Burns long, meaty buds. This might be that kind of weed they call "heady" and gives an aesthetic head high annnnnd it's five minutes later and oh boy.  oh fuck.

Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1356745,"“Stopped my oncoming migraine, including bright lights in my vision after 1 bowl. Actually went outside and did some yard work after feeling like I wanted to lay down in a dark place. smells great, thanks green barn farms, best sun grown I've had!”"
Katsama,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1373061,"“Really great strain. I give 5 out of 5. I am a total sucker for Jack Frost and I find similar effects with the more popular and readily available Jacky White. Also found that this is a good strain to smoke any way and really enjoyable as a joint. 

Perfect for mornings/ day time, Stress, depression, and if you want to be smiley. Great for pain when you want to be active.”"

MvF,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1287015,"“Relaxed-but-aware, fairly creative high. (Great for meditation) The strain is VERY resinous like its parent, White Widow. Used in my Crafty vaporizer, my sessions last twice as long compared to any other strain. Great genetics—highly recommended if you can find some.”"
64Tuna,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1506954,"“This was recommended to me by Josh at Spark1 under my request of a productive strain. This hit the nail right on the head with that i mind, starting with a lightweight behind the eyes, spacy head high. Very mild, so dosage is consistent. Perfect in looks, smell, and effects. 5/5 Spark1!”"

petethekoala,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1262854,"“This herb taste awesome! The combination of sweet fruit makes you immediately think about a tropical fruit salad. The buzz starts as a smooth funky mind buzz but strike you about 30 minutes later as a full blast body and mind high. Pain melt away instantly. Very powerful but forgiving. A bit too strong for beginners but a careful intermediate users will probably love this one! Not good if you have a lot of intellectu...”"

mrteche21,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1583363,"“This is a simple sativa with a great initial mental zing followed by a strong crash. I really enjoy the focus I get initially when I smoke. I’m really able to be productive for about an hour, but when the crash comes it hits hard. I typically need to smoke again or take a nap after an hour.”"

ThisOneTimeAtUmass,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacky-white/reviews/1568938,"“Second shelf Sativa leaning hybrid. A bit of conflict on the palate between the Jack and White genetics diminishes a slightly better than average buzz.”"

The hit was thick and really lung heavy, I'm not a cougher but this got me. The high is just as intense. It shut me down for about 30mins and any motivation went out the window. The high is really short but that's not a big enough deal breaker, you get stoned as shit. If you want to get super high try and find this gem ...”"
