Grimace
=============
Yelwaccm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1368404,"“This is a really cool strain I came across in my ventures- Its a COMPLETELY purple plant/bud, EXCEPT the fact that the stem ALWAYS stays lime green on this strain unlike some or a few other purple buds etc- (You can make a plant purple, this is one that is NATURALLY like this, not altered.) It can be a very dank bud when grown and cured properly. I liked it more for the gimmick of smoking a purple bud, I didn't think...”"
Rain_Man,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1377161,"“Powerful body-high, usually get couch locked. Really good for listening to music. Dense purple nuggets that are moist with resin and the smell is out of this world. Only downside is that it only lasts a short time, peaking at around 30 minutes in.”"
Chibby71,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1358273,"“A nice mellow bud. If you're stressed this one is for you!”"
ChubbyCheddah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1186860,"“Very tasty. Light purple buds with a mellow head high. Perfect for vibing to some revolutionary Raggae music or just chillin with friends. I got mines from the PDA lounge in Downtown Seattle.”"
1gotgoodz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1155743,"“Hints of green and purple are masked by this trichome covered medicine. Great for the advanced smoker. It tastes of a sweet citrus that I am unfamiliar with like hints of orange and lemon but smoothed over with a lingering musk of the two fruits.”"
reedup,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1322952,"“I loooooovvee this strain. Deep purple tons of terps an oh sooooo tasty.”"
Dryland2012,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1334216,"“I loved the beautiful black-purple hue to the buds on this batch of Grimace OG! It was a very quick-acting head high, with thick smoke that filled the bong. The taste was pretty harsh upon first hit, but as soon as you exhale, you get a very pleasant grape flavor--it's like candy! Effects include giggles, munchies, and dorkiness.”"
AlexSergeevich,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1320507,"“Decent relaxing indica. Smells hops, pine and mint/basil, light taste.”"
FrodinFrodin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1258500,"“Next Harvest in Denver has been carrying what they call Grim.  It is an extremely purple bud.  For purposes of sleep I prefer Tahoe.   For visual impressiveness though your friends will love it.”"
N8tiveCOKush303,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1296683,"“Grimace is great to look at, and even better to smoke. Could be too heavy for those who don't regularly smoke, so prepared to get dankrafied!”"
Valkyrune,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1469908,"“My local dispensary had Grimace Glue, and oh my God it had my brain feeling like it was in a nice bubble bath. Gorilla Glue makes me a little too mentally charged, but Grimace Glue had me feeling nice and stupid for a few hours.”"
LiftedSparky420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1303349,"“Relaxing heavy hitting indica.”"
Ariesfire87,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1736777,"“Honestly i loce this strain. It kicks in slowly and starts to give you a heavy body feeling. Once you lay down you dont want to get up. Your eyes become heavy and your mind just relaxes. Laughing at everything and anything usually is part of the experience as well. The high lingers and if you smoke this too late in the night usually I wake up still in a heavy eyed state where I dont want to leave my bed. Its amazing!”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1358330,"“Meh. It's definitely good for sleep, but that's about it, and there are many other strains that'll make you sleepy. My partner and I both found it a bit anxiety producing, so I won't be getting it again.”"
KushyComfy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1377163,"“There is some purple phenotype in this dank bud for sure, also a smell of lemon-lime suggest Sativa. 

Very potent hybrid, strong hitting with velvety hints during exhale, air is left smelling like HAPPY PINESOL AIR. 

Very good all arounder for anything.”"
GnarKill93,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1350423,"“Very powerful yet very delicious strong buds, this was like the third I tried after starting to smoke again and certainly was the strongest one I felt lol very good tho, highly reccomended stuff certainly in my opinion!”"
PizzaChamp420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1224607,"“Experience: Mild, mellow yet alert. Memory inducing. Body is very relaxed, but mind is clear and focused. A great daytime indica. 
Usage: Great for staying in on a rainy day.
Look/Feel: This was described as being purple, and I see that in some photos, but this one is not purple. This is a lime green with clusters of short, thick, orange hairs and a good amount of small to medium crystals with a few large crystals. S...”"

LocoRado,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1234423,"“Very chill and relaxing. I liked it a lot.”"
guanope,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1292845,"“This strain is, quite possibly, the best strain for me when I want to get knocked the heck out and just go to bed. It eases you into this calm, serene high, and where many strains just have me super relaxed, this one goes one step further and makes me need to close my eyes for a deep, uninterrupted sleep. This one is definitely worth a try if you're having trouble in the snoozing department.”"
PDXAidan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1226350,"“Better than expected. Pleased with this one”"
nickrazza,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1247066,"“Grimace (known for the being the purple mascot in early McDonalds commercials) - gives two good reasons to bare the name of 'Grimace OG Kush' 

1. The purple, fat structure is that off a nutrient rich/deficient OG Kush, producing a mildly sweeter flavor on the draw, with the kush tones we've grown to love touching the tongue on the exhale.
2. The high resembles a couch lock 'DUH' feeling you receive after indulging i...”"
nobabylon50,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1279502,"“Very good. The taste is awesome too. The whole bud is purple, just like Grimace from McDonald's lol. Not just the outside of the bud, but the whole damn bud, inside and out. The stem is purple too. When I saw this I was shocked to see a purple bud. Highly  (no pun intended) a very good strain. I recommend this strain.”"
guanope,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1288951,"“Impressed by the level of pain relief in this strain. I was using it for back pain and abdomen cramping right as I was unwinding for the night and it was decent enough to have made me forget all about it. The sleepy effects are pretty quick, getting my eyelids drooping about a half hour after smoking it. Definitely a quality nighttime strain for needing sleep on sore nights.”"
Cy108,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1312085,"“Not too strong, but just enough. Although I vape on low temps. Makes you sleepy in a way you cant keep your eyes open, at least for me.”"

SweetTooth66,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1268543,"“Grimace is a strain named after the big purple McDonald's mascot. This strain always has at least a little purple in it, usually a lot, and is also covered in trichomes. It's is a very crystally bud that had a very dense structure. The buds are very dense. The smell is of a deep resiny smell. It literally smells like hash won't maybe a hint of berry in the background from the purple urkle genetics. I'm sure this stra...”"
SweetTooth66,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1286466,"“This is a really nice purple strain that is always caked in crystals. It's super purple but also crystally. It's more of a looker strain than a smeller. It's smells just like hash, tarish, resiny smell with a hint of berry. It's a super potent indica that will knock you back leaving you relaxed and ready to have a good meal. It has a very resiny afghani purple urkle feel to it. It has great indica characteristics.”"
Medmar2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1145404,"“Immediately I noticed my body feeling fine, backache, leg cramps, ankle pain - GONE.  My head was mellow but not jello.  I thought about backing it up with a medicine woman puff or two, didn't,  because in the time you can peep at a strain review...I'm noticing I'm happy  and painless.  Grimace does the job.”"

musicfan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1277947,"“Graded well on appearance, taste, and smell  so three stars there. I bought this to relieve difficult neuropathic pain where other Indicas fail. But Grimace is very effective so there's the final two stars for effect - a perfect 5 stars! 

Used it in the evening so sleep was welcome. Would recommend to a friend with warnings about sedation/couch-lock. Would definitely purchase Grimace strain in the future.”"

TechnoNshWeed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1310890,"“This is everything that you'd expect from an indica. Great looking bud, dense dark green with purple hairs. Smells really sweet for an indica, but earthy as usual. Nothing much to add or explain here because again, it is just a great classic indica high! Stoned body, stoned mind, euphoric relaxation and the desire to sleep. 

Look: 5/5
Scent: 5/5
High: 5/5 (Night use)
Burnout: 5/5 (You'll be sleeping)
Overall: 5/5”"

Squidpants,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grimace/reviews/1538347,"“I have a few grams left of this, and I really hope I get the chance to purchase it again.
Brutal sedating power and every time I bought it, the taste was mostly grape.
Here's hoping in the coming legal market some producer makes this strain a mainstay!”"
