GC is always know to provide effects for even veteran consumers after only a few hits. GC is a crowd favorite due to its high potency and overall cerebral invigoration.

Synthie,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-crack/reviews/1415010,"‚ÄúSeriously, the sex on this strain has been... the BEST ever. My wife and I love it.

I have little memory of my high, but I do remember feeling very happy and energetic to the point of little control. I haven‚Äôt tried this strain since my early days of smoking in spring of grade 11, so my opinions may have changed now that I‚Äôm more experienced, and my tolerance is higher.‚Äù"

Schiz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-crack/reviews/1096328,"‚ÄúThey call it Green Crack because it's really good, but leaves you yearning for more soon.  The high doesn't last to long, but it's a strong, uniquely energetic buzz.  The buds tend to be bright, Crayola green in tiny, dense nuggets, and the smell is light, fresh, and citrusy.  Good to smoke, but nothing to get super excited about.‚Äù"

I suggest they call it green crack because it never really gets you high.
