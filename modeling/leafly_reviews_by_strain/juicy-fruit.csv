You can't hold back the automatic smile that this strain brings on.  If you're into euphoria (and who isn't?)  it's your strain.  This one was clear headed as well and made the day fly by in a fun filled way.  I'd purchase it again, for sure ... probably stock up, as well, which for me means buying more than an eighth.”"

It puts a smile on my face every time I open the jar and get a smell of this beautiful strain. If you like Sativa as I do then you will love Juicy Fruit.

Definitely gives off an creative, expressive feeling. A will to get things done, especially things that you've been putting off more, or not looking forward to. However the come-down is very quick, but on the bright side doesn't leave you fatigued 👍🏼 Makes my ...”"

The effects are nearly immediate and creep up fast. I didn't realize for a second that they were in full effect. It is definitely a GREAT hybrid. I catch myself staring out the window a lot and just t...”"

My introduction to Juicy Fruit's effects happened first thing this morning. Previously, I read a few reviews about this strain in which the authors stated that JF may cause some dizziness at the onset of administering it. I've found that true for a few other strains, which for some users, may induce a bit of paranoia or anxiety. To avo...”"

On the other hand, it's very rough to smoke, even out of an iced water pipe. I coughed every single time I smoked this strain. I got more high from coughing my lungs out than inhaling and absorbing the THC in the bud. 

I would recommend, but only for rolling. A lot of this strain will get you stoned, but not a little.”"
