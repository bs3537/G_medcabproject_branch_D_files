Critical Widow is the right strain for my illnesses from a car accident fibromyaliga, pinch nerve in my neck, heriated disk in my neck, torn rotor cup in my right shoulder, etc.  When you first talke a puff you don't feel it, but then it creeps up.  my pain was a 20 instead of 1-10 level of pain.

UngravitousMako,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-widow/reviews/1359310,"“Critical Widow nugs are dense and resinous, with high bag appeal.  I'm not sure if I got an off phenotype, but this batch from Harvest smells strongly of pickles, tasting much the same, though that is my only real complaint.  While smooth, it still lets you know you're getting something.  I find myself relaxed yet energetic, mildly social and quietly contemplative with this strain as my L4-L5 disc pain eases itself i...”"

Cannabis_Dynamics,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-widow/reviews/1497169,"“This is an amazing strain (vaped) but still quite rare which is a shame. It's perfect for spending time alone in the house, extremely relaxing but your mind still functions, its extremely strong so be careful with dosage. The strain is not good for busy places, as it gives a calm/euphoric feeling but unlike other indicas, it's more satisfying, with amazing body feelings and head high together. I hope this strain gain...”"

The Taste is amazing! Don't let the 10 minutes of nothing fool you. You're about to get blasted off to a whole nother world. Once you get crushed, effects are very disassociative, sense of reality diminished. Feet do land though. Relaxation ensues. A lazy river. Not great for trying to get anything done. Feet up, p...”"

Me and my friends had a musical jam whilst smoking this and it wasn't long before things got weird; playing the trippiest sounds I have heard in a while. Ahahaha. Excellent strain and a definite reccomemdation!”"

The bud looks beautiful, dense, frosty and smells a little sweet maybe fruity with an earthy undertone. 

Smoke was not as smooth as I would like, but it wasn't bad either. This is the only strain I'v tried that actually put me on my ass. I purchased it from The Kine Mine in Idaho Springs, Colorado. I went back a few months later to g...”"
