    A very strong, heavy high. Great body high for pain. Brings a warm happy calm with it.
    Sticky, green bud with pale orange hairs. Smells of sour and sage.‚Äù"

silasbotwin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1183665,"‚ÄúOne of the top 3 strains I have ever smoked in my years of being a cannabis consumer. Incredible effects take immediate action relieving the pain and stress from the day. Without a question at practically a 100% indica, this is very much either a lazy rainy day or a night time strain. Made the mistake of wake and baking with this stuff and I just loathed the housework as I did it cause all I wanted to do was just sit...‚Äù"
stonedconecat360,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1306198,"‚ÄúPerfect for anyone who suffers from insomnia and/or depression. It relaxes you and helps with a good night's sleep. Definitely my go-to strain.‚Äù"

I always get a fantastic night's sleep with it and always end up more giggly and happy after smoking. Only negative is you get the munchies for some weird stuff but other than that, it's my go to strain!‚Äù"
Stonerrants,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1518147,"‚ÄúI suffer from crippling depression and I've been pretty bad for the last week or so. I smoked a bowl of this last night for the first time and then was the only strain (out of the 5 I have on hand) that was able to lift me up out of my fog. I was able to look at things objectively and have some self reflection. And I FINALLY feel like a human being again. This is wonderful stuff. I can't praise it enough‚Äù"

sn0w0wl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1264124,"‚ÄúWhat can I say, I love me some dirty imported hash. I've sought out hashes from the far corners of the globe (RIP TSC & SR) and this never fails to impress. Clean burning, soft, tasty handmade hash <3‚Äù"
WaBudtender08,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1315245,"‚ÄúGreat traditional weed flavor, helped relax me and get me towards bed. Only downside is the effects take a little bit longer than usual to hit me. But once they hit - they're perfect!‚Äù"
22ace22,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1583140,"‚Äúnice riding indica initially uplifting and great for creativity but not recommended for anything needing intense concentration. moderate couch lock with a knock-out finish good night zzzzz‚Äù"
bargaal,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1554471,"‚ÄúIncredible strain! Very nice smell upon opening the bag. Smoked out of a bong - sweet, earthy aroma | typical indica effects (sleepy, relaxed) 10-15 mins. after smoking a nice warm feeling came over me, almost like a cozy blanket. Half an hour later I was asleep haha. Slept like baby! One of my favourite strains atm :)‚Äù"
YabberDabberDoobie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1295332,"‚ÄúThe very first pure indica strain I have ever had, and to this day one of my favorite strains. Extremely heavy body high that gives you the pressure behind the eyes feeling on that first hit. I have had both the flower and concentrate forms, and I like both of them equally. Taking a dab of this stuff is super sedative and pain-relieving. Cannot focus well with it at all. Perfect for a relaxing night listening to musi...‚Äù"
esellwood,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1524091,"‚ÄúI'm very anxiety prone and a lot of different strains will make it worse. This was top notch for relaxation, pretty heavy all over. Super chill strain.‚Äù"
Merv_,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1738045,"‚ÄúAs someone who is sensitive to anxiety and panic attacks this strain really helps, in small doses!
Really calming strain, full body relaxation. 
But when i take a little more it quickly made me very uncomfortable because i got dizzy and could not move from the cough, being this paralyzed makes me anxious it appears.
I can imagine people loving this effect but it triggered a panic attack in me.
Still loving this one t...‚Äù"
BostonBill,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1576090,"‚ÄúCaregiver dropped off this morning,smoked half a bowl of this wonderful woody,hint of pine strain. 4 hours later still feel relaxed. Will be perfect for night smoke. A little strong for day smoking‚Äù"
Mixtape623,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1644466,"‚ÄúFor myself, I find this to be a nice 'middle of the road' indica, where I am able to enjoy the THC effects without losing focus or attention to things. It mellows me out, but doesn't glue me to the couch. I love it.‚Äù"
rebagirl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1175413,"‚ÄúI love this strain, never tried it and recently found some and it is amazing. The particular grower I had grew the strain to perfection. It is sticky with trichromes that are coating the buds. It smokes incredible not harsh at all with a great flush, as well as being grown to its full potential. The high is thought provoking, relaxing, and great for medicine! The taste and smell are great to with a pungent aroma of s...‚Äù"
VainheartWar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1245876,"‚ÄúGreat floral and full flavor. Reacted very quickly with tingly feeling. Not so much of up lifting rather than an almost heavy feeling. Slightly anxious.‚Äù"

Yumiro,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1272995,"‚Äú10/10. I smoked the one from "Deepwater LLC" and it's a very potent indica. It will soothe and make you go to sleep.‚Äù"
Toke2toke,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1264006,"‚Äúhas a pine smell.  could be a little softer but still nice enough to make a snake with.  lots of fun to smoke, hot knives had me choking but after that i was giggly for a while.‚Äù"

thingamajing,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-afghan/reviews/1154280,"‚ÄúMy first cannabis that I actually knew the name of the strain. Indica and well pure one for that matter. Was there long before anyone knew. Makes you very relaxed, you start to enjoy music a lot, reading is always good idea when smoking afghan. After 30 min you will be thinking about things you could eat. The whole show ends on the sofa.

By doing some little work, hobby or thinking then you will have all this nice c...‚Äù"
