BeerGoddess,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-skellington/reviews/1382218,"“My first review on Leafly!

Aroma is citrus and slightly petroleum. Flavors follow suit. Seems to burn clean. Not a lot of lingering flavor.

This is a very good "get 'er done" strain! Great for puttering around the house, hanging with friends (kind of gives me the giggles) or working on light-duty projects. Uplifting and energizing. Me likey!”"
