samuelpetu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/csg/reviews/1793395,"“Very good decent hybrid, has a energizing feel at the start then mellows down to a relaxing state and very light heady dizzy and such.”"
Rokitfingers,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/csg/reviews/1798304,"“Nice even hybrid. Good pain relief with minimal sleepiness. Roll up with an indica or a sativa to boost cerebral or body effects.”"
