It's a smooth, mellow, functional buzz that just takes the edge off of my worries.  It lightens the mood for me.  The munchies take a long time to hit, and a small snack does the trick.  By all accounts, its a mild, moderate, reliable and steady high. The lower THC and high  CBD help sooth the aches while still s...”"

I got this because I tend to like haze lineage and skunk lineage strains and the combination was...ok. I smoked a little with Thanksgiving dinner and it was nice and relaxing with almost no other effects (no giggliness, no body sensation, no headiness, etc.) which I appreciated but I ended up smoking a bunch to stay in that zone. Despite the sativa dominance, I ...”"

The effects for me were almost entirely physical - very weird time-slowing like my sense of touch was on a slight delay.
