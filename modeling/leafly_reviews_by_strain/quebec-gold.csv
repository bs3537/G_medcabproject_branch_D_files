megatonik420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/quebec-gold/reviews/1334875,"“This strain is fire. It gets you high before you even realize it. For me, I got high very fast. You feel heavy for a while. What describe that strain for me is : vibration and head high. My mind felt like it was vibrating. A very relaxing and euphoric strain too. I recommend to anyone living in Quebec.”"
petethekoala,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/quebec-gold/reviews/1325128,"“Smells like strong citrus although not he best taste. Had this strain back home at the end of the 1990"s in Quebec city. Strong buzz but a bit anxious at times. Seen much stronger buzz before and after. Good entry level weed.”"
akanboryu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/quebec-gold/reviews/1077509,"“Good pain relief with an overall body relaxation high. Not extremely pungent smell. Gives  a very nice buzz  with an energy high.  Great weed to take to work, just keep water or a drink near by, can give you a wicked case of dry mouth.”"

Great high, but could be better for the term "gold" 
Nug are beautiful
Great for social, helps my anxiety, and can sure help to cut the stress of your daily life”"
