White Lightning

MoonstoneConnection,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lightning/reviews/1395526,"“Very quick acting tasty bud. I enjoyed both the taste and effect! My strain was actually crossed with purple kush for Purple White Lightning.”"
indicuh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lightning/reviews/1414143,"“This was quite possibly the strongest strain I've tried yet and I've been a regular toker for about 2 years. Especially in the last few months, I've sparked up every day at least once and was beginning to grow accustomed to the high. I did everything from dabs, to bongs, to good ol' fashion j's. The high was becoming sub-par no matter how much I smoked. I felt like I needed to hotbox with Seth Rogen, Doug Benson, and...”"
catpoop,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lightning/reviews/1392821,"“White Lightning is the cross between two amazing strains; White Widow & Northern Lights. It's a sativa-heavy hybrid that feels, how a good sativa should, like a thunderstorm is brewing inside your head. Long lasting effects and a pleasant flavor, like a mix between ripe fruit and vegetables, make this worthy of both the prestiege of its award-winning parents, and its curiously exciting name. Don't hesitate to give th...”"
Bugmenot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lightning/reviews/1379597,"“Smokes how it looks and smells - Natural Skunky Trees. Long Holiday like buds, that are soft and squishy to the touch. Extreme Calm: Feel the need to stretch, walk, run, meditate, read, do yoga. Body pain doesn't disappear like Blue Dream strain, but becomes more manageable due to reduced stiffness in joints and muscles.”"
KingDaddio,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lightning/reviews/1426710,"“A unique indica-dominant hybrid.  It's sativa properties are immediately evident after three pulls.  Feels like there are clouds in your head - you feel light but heavy at the same time.  This was a fantastic strain that I grossly underestimated!  I meant to purchase 'the white' but got this instead and I do not regret it.  Hardly any munchies and has a relaxing/uplifting effect - it put me in such a good mood—even m...”"
Raminator,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lightning/reviews/1381697,"“Hands down my favorite. Most people have or will wind up finding that one strain that seems like it was just for them. This is that strain for me. Most memorable, pleasurable strain I'd ever tried hands down.”"

Slimwhite,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lightning/reviews/1331327,"“First hit I took, I was surprised about how smooth it smokes. Great toke for sure. Very energizing strain, but good for relaxing as well, and if you're a creative person? This strains for you.”"

SiriusSativa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lightning/reviews/1349793,"“A very smooth hybrid that has a rather dominant earthy tone to its flavor. Great strain for a mid-day toke. Stress relieving and body pain relieving. Overall, highly recommended.”"

Trisha44,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lightning/reviews/1387509,"“Perfect for lounging watching tv and just relaxing. I found it helped relax my tense muscles in my shoulders and neck. I did want snacks...but that goes with tv watching..right? 
I don't recall the flavor but I liked it and purchased it three times. Very well cured buds, coated!”"
TechnoNshWeed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lightning/reviews/1313690,"“This is an indica dominant hybrid, if not indica purely. This strain is amazing and that's underestimating that value of it. The nugs are covered in layers of white trichomes that literally make it look like a tiny snowball. And with the bright green look, tiny orange hairs everywhere... It's a beauty to look at. Very vibrant kush tones of earth and sweetness. Now the smoke is the best of course, with a bottomless pi...”"

Very pungent, and it's inherited the Skunk aroma and it's got that sweetness at the end of the exhale.  My batch is from an expert and I know he's cured this strain for at least 6 weeks as it's that fine.  As an indoor grower I know this following my first toke o...”"

I think I have an eating disorder because I find myself eating at times I'm not even hungry. Sure this weed gives me munchies just like any other, however the next day I find myself not eating anywhere near as much as I normally would.

The high is strong but functional for a veteran toker. When it comes to growing this strain, anyone can with just a little knowledge. An experienced grower can push her to something spectacular.

AfroAtheist_Insta,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lightning/reviews/1681788,"“The taste of the weed is underwhelming for the name “lightning”.

The high is very relaxing, but also some sativa side.”"

Definitely brought out the anxiety in me, time after time.. So much that I ended up making brownies with the rest of the half OZ. I don't really recommend this to anyone, would not smoke again.”"
