Blue Goo
=============
Telperion69,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-goo/reviews/1351166,"“Really excellent for daytime use. Moderate cerebral lift that walks into a smooth warm body snuggle that's not overly couch locky, but if you keep at it, the goo can take you there. I didn't get all the berryliciousness with my sample where I am, but it looks just like some of these photos of the silverish purple blue hue with smaller denser bud formation. Not much aroma either except for a distinct dusty of a berry ...”"

The medz I purchased were labeled Blueberry Goo, but the berry taste in the description lends to the case being made that Blue Goo and Blueberry Goo are the same thing. Sedated is the word I'd use to describe the most prominent of effects I experienced. I felt more 🤤than 😴 and I experienced a solid 30 mins of trippy, euphoric, "sativa" energy high before the Ativa...”"

Great with music ^_^”"
rasneil925,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-goo/reviews/1185352,"“I acquired my cannabis from California Collective Care (CCC) in Vallejo, California. Upon looking at the buds, blue goo is one of the prettiest strains of cannabis I have ever beheld! When I opened the bag it reeks of strong potent fruitiness that I can't quite pinpoint. The buds themselves are compact, yet retain a light fluffiness with a lot of shape to it. They are lime green with beautiful shades of very light bl...”"
pugsnkisses,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-goo/reviews/1334397,"“Smoking it right now :) DELICIOUS! Smokes well and smooth yet gives you a relaxing nice strong high :) I just picked mine up at an Arizona dispensary, very fresh and soft with long bright green leafs and little orange flowers all over. I def recommend this strain! Great day high yet with a smooth transition into a couch lock.”"
Schiz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-goo/reviews/1334398,"“This distinctive-looking bud is great for smoking anytime.  Dark purple/green with same-coloured trichomes and a light skunky smell define it, as well as the smokey-piney flavour.  The buzz is very relaxing, and is primo for walking around and enjoying a lazy day (or night), especially if you're trying to destress.  Good stuff.”"
deadpools,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-goo/reviews/1597226,"“I suffer from major depression. I smoked Blue Goo and suddenly I had more energy and motivation to do things around the house I just couldn’t make myself do before. My brain feels alive, this is the best functional high I’ve EVER had and I am in love. This is best for daytime use. Unless you want to get something done at night besides sleeping!”"

I had a ton of frequent audible hallucinations, visual trips, and gave a great dreamy feeling to my entire body. The smell is dank as hell, the buds are a bright green with lots of crystals. I highly recommend smoking this outdoors or an area with lots of sound. Music is a must have.”"

Feelings -  Euphoric, creative, and socially outgoing, excited to be connected. Longevity of high was substantial and no crash. I didn't feel the need to continually have to smoke.  Live to smoke but I didn't need much! Beautiful colors and crystals, smell and taste was out of this world!”"
TheWord,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-goo/reviews/1259706,"“I picked up an 1/8th of Blueberry Goo from my local dispensary (I'm assuming Blue Goo is the same thing). This is an indic a dominant hybrid that starts off with a head high that lasts about 20 to 30 minutes before settling into a body high that pretty much puts you to sleep. It's not super strong and is not a good strain for concerts or social activities. Overall I would rate it a 5 out of 10.”"
