The tricones on the bud where nice and white with large white crystals that can be seen from the plan of your hand. THC was around 16% which sound pretty darn great for a smoke session any day.”"

Helps one to settle into relaxation. Open the bag and wow...awesome nose treat too. Fills the room fast with it’s aromatherapy. With that being said...If your like me and like to work right after medicating. You can with this it’s mood dependent on how it works. You wanna just veg so be it. It does the...”"

I have been looking for something that taste fruity like berries and sweet but also something that wont crash me in the couch, this is the best tasting and best feeling high i have had yet, takes the pain away and gives you a clear calm demeanor about you.
