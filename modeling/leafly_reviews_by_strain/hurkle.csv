Cordaena,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1385735,"“I've been trying to find a strain for around 6 months that would work on my fibro, but everything I tried caused severe dyskinesia, which of course just makes my pain worse. This one was the jack pot. Very mellow, left me clear headed, didn't cause the normal heartburn or coughing I get from all the other ones I've tried. Bonus points is that the body high was very slight, and I was left feeling so close to normal th...”"
chupacabra84,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1392583,"“Very large, dense, and sticky buds. It has a 1.6:1 CBD to THC ratio with CBD at 18% and THC at 11%.  Three full capacity draws on my PAX2 and I feel relaxed, happy and less stressed but no overwhelming high or cloudyness. I feel what may be tingling across my brow. I'm giving this five stars because it helps my depression, and stress while allowing me to keep my focus.”"
DaddyDD,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1385738,"“I love this strain. The 1 : 1.3 ratio of THC:CBD is perfect for me. Mine was lab tested at 6.9% THC and 9.1% CBD. It's great for pain and anxiety with a very mild indica-like high so it's useful during the day and also  doesn't keep you up at night. This is great medical cannabis that works well for me. It won't appeal to recreational though users due to the low THC, high CBD ratio. That's one thing I love about cann...”"

It's my 1st high CBD home grown and a complete winner.

kushbush1904,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1361735,"“I personally love this strain and had a dispensary reserve an eighth for me after picking up a ten dollar gram of it to try it out and make sure it was cbd heavy. I feel as if this is truely a 1:1 strain and I consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to cbd... The batch I had was covered in yellow trichomes on the inside of the super dense nugs that had a slight pine smell but mostly coffee and earthy notes...”"
CelesteCat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1385741,"“My sinus headache went away about an hour after trying Hurkle. I felt more physically relaxed but not drowsy so I was able to do some house and yard chores. Has some cocoa or coffee flavor.”"
bigbuds42080,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1368692,"“I though this strain hurkle was very berry tasting and had a 11.56%c.b.d 7.68% t.h.c so I defiantly like this strain for my depression, anxiety,and pain purposes I would rate this strain.
 a 8 but the stars don't go that high.”"
razerblades420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1318923,"“Small dense buds with good trichomes. Small stems, and the buds break up into larger than expected bowls.You will have enough finger hash to be worth saving.

Very tasty greens make you think of berries. Smooth and aromatic. Bong hits recommended.

You will feel the indica and CBD behind your eyes, but just enough sativa parentage to keep you from getting too couch locked.

Will never be sorry to get this strain.”"
PineappleScott,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1572761,"“This is like the " Miller lite " of marijuana. 

I can always find it very cheap and its pretty good. This truely is the coors or miller lite of pot. It could very easily be your every day smoke. Its pretty good too. 

The smell is pretty traditional of most cannabis . Sort of that skunky and pungent smell. It is going to get you high ... a nice mellow high , nothing too crazy. The 1:1 THC/CBD ratio pokes its head up...”"

EDR3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1361738,"“Great body high with a calm, clear, and focused head. I have tried two different strains, the latter of which had a much higher CBD to THC ratio which made for a much clearer mind. This is my go to daytime smoke when there's still things to get done. It can be difficult to find, I've had to go to a new shop everytime I've looked for it, so stock up when you see it!”"

Noca,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1365238,"“This batch is 7.0% THC and 12.4% CBD and was my 2nd medical Marijuana strain I ever tried.  I vape it and find an immediate relaxing effect in my head and body, my arthritis dissappears in about 30 seconds while taking the edge off the rest of my chronic pain.  In about several minutes it starts to eliminate my nausea without making me overly hungry.  I find it works really well for shutting down stomach aches/spasms...”"
Nid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1485946,"“Aside from serious cotton mouth and a bad case of munchies, this smooth strain is absolutely wonderful!  Get's rid of nausea, melts away stress, and is totally safe for newbees new to cannabis, great day time strain, no couch lock, even if u vape all day long.  I love the clear minded relaxed feeling.  It is not a super invigorating high like some sativas, but then again there is no paranoia either. Much like it's pa...”"

kanna37,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1330143,"“Hurkle's got my vote.  This is the first nearly 1:1 ratio strain I've tried, and I have to admit, I'm impressed.  4.8  on the scale for me.  This is a great strain for nightime use, as the CBD gives you a numbing body high that destroys pain, and the THC gives you that same numbing, comfortably warm effect to the mind.  If you get the chance, try it!”"
SmokeandDoom,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1357786,"“Got some of this for my lady who has high anxiety. Although it didn't really help with that, the high was great  probably one of the best I've had in a while.”"

Thedank26,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1523314,"“A high cbd strain with around 10 % thc. This is a really food smooth smoke. It has a tropical taste to it i cant put my finger on but it is a tasty herb. Great for pain insomnia and general deppresion. Who will want to get up and go. This herb got me up and at em. Got to say this is a home run strain. I am a higj tolerent smoker daily but this low thc ganga can keep up with tje big boys with only 10 % thc and 8% cbd ...”"

My back didn't hurt at all and that's rare with fibro! Tasted a bit like sweet tarts to me too. Havent found one yet to work this good. Hoping they will have some flower in stock soon!”"
MistaJayHaHaHa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1387814,"“I love this strain because it's high in CBD and low in THC. It makes me feel relaxed but not sleepy. It takes the nausea away associated with Crohn's Disease and it helped me get through a flare up. It also gives mild munchies which helped me pull through the flare up. It has an earthy and chocolate smell.”"
Frozenfever1978,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1795953,"“This is by far my favorite strain. Love that the CBD is pretty much a 1:1 . The THC is fairly low too so you can function. I suffer bad anxiety and have lower sciatic nerve pain and this helps a lot with pain and takes away my anxiety. It gives you a nice mellow high, mellow enough you can still do things and function. It doesn't give me the couch lock like some others I've tried for my anxiety. Love the body high to...”"

Woodyche,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1801109,"“I hope the future of cannabis focuses a good portion of its energy towards these CBD strains.  The one-dimensionality of THC focused strains becomes obvious after you've delved into the world of CBD strains.  I contemplate the productive and creative output of the 1960s with artists like Dylan, the Beatles and the jazz cats, and imagine they were smoking cannabis that hadn't had the CBD bred out of it, and was likely...”"

JLKATHERMAN,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1246318,"“this strain works very well with helping migranes. The run I got had THC 9.8% and CBD 11.4%. I didn't get super blasted, and I was able to get on with my day migrane free.”"
rusti26,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1476201,"“This is niiiiicccce, like a fleece blanket and cocoa on a snowy day. So comfy (sitting in 405 traffic).
Low THC so took a lot to get HIGH. 
Also great in smaller doses through out the day to numb the aches and pains a bit while leaving you fully functional.”"
waterlily314,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1392572,"“This strain requires the right time and moment to smoke. The more I smoked, the better it got. BUT, I probably wouldn't smoke this or purchase this strain again. Hurkle is not a social weed. It is meant for relaxing on the couch, and probably for laying down. I smoked this before I went to a hockey game and I had no emotion. I just watched the game in a daze. It did make me a little dizzy, which then made me nauseous...”"
kushbush1904,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hurkle/reviews/1289821,"“Super dense nugs that smelt sweet with a little pine and earthy notes... Definitely a 1:1 strain that I consider one of my favorite. The nugs are covered in dark yellow trichomes... Tastes of berries and sweet coffee.”"
