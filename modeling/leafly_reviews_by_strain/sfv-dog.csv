Progdad02,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1370551,"“This is the first strain I tried after getting my mmj card; I consider SFV Dog to be my 1st love of mmj! This is my favorite strain by far! It's very strong, but absolutely NO paranoia whatsoever! I'd recommend this more for day medicating, but after a couple hours, I slept well, just a great strain all the way around!”"
MmjDoctorOnline,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1372428,"“great strain especially if you have depression, makes you feel euphoric and relaxed. Try and be positive”"
UngravitousMako,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1379780,"“SFV Dog is quickly becoming a staple strain for me.  Between the mellow citrus flavors that aren't overwhelmed by earthiness, and its ability to take me from an ADD mess to the fost mocused  I've ever been (no, really, this strain CRUSHES Attention Deficit), I'll be picking this strain up frequently.

As a note, the sample I got was potent, testing at over 28% thc.  Be careful with this one, as it's possible to overd...”"
TDRgeochem,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1368956,"“I was surprised in a variety of ways by this potent strain. With the cheese-like aroma to the bright frosting of crystals on the buds, the flower form is notably powerful and left me too baffled to play Batman. The taste was rather mellow and I found myself coughing considerably less than usual. The stoney head high is very relaxing and comforting, though I can't say it's anxiety-calming after a day's use. It helped ...”"
theadamharris,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1368955,"“Beautifully pungent skunky yet sweet aroma.  The taste is savory with a pine background and a lasting after taste that brings you right into the woods the initial body feel was very relaxed and calm.  My mind transcended into creativity yet not rushing or overwhelming. Just a lazy and gentle ease that freed my mind from everything else but intellectual thinking.  The stress of the day just melted away.  Zero paranoia...”"

Gomez9741,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1360593,"“If this is in your Dispensaries, try some. Personally one of my favorite go to meds that's been steady. Worth a Jimmy fart or 2 no doubt”"
Dastomba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1524784,"“I call this strain “Mind Eraser” as you will forget your name on this. Great night time med to relax and watch a movie without a care in the world. Not a good med to focus or do thought related tasks on.  Very good choice for pain and insomnia.”"
hellaxtracted760,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1395067,"“super fire . no paranoia . when this crossed with face off og. it's makes Valley girl 30%thc. Best strain hands down, however since it's rare the rolls choice and the sfv dog are the most potent strands that they carry.. "Lemonhead Og" too”"
AgentAK,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1475405,"“Method of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer 

Pros: Very fast acting, effects felt almost instantly. Pain relief and relaxation. Some euphoria, head effects that elevate your mood.

Cons: Dry mouth

Taste/Draw: Light piney/citrus with hint of diesel on exhale. Normal draw & exhale.

Overall/Other: Couch lock is present. Works fast. Little heady, but in a relaxing way. Good for killing pain. Probably  not the best for be...”"

rismor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1705985,"“I’m smoking this on a vape so the taste isn’t as great as it would be with actual bud, but!

This shit had me double taking. It’s an experience with each hit. 

Taste: 4/5
Happier: yeeeee”"

Truth1116,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1371998,"“This batch of SFV Dog I have here is awesome, very piney, and very relaxing. 
I don't know what good these reviews are when it really depends on the grower. Nobody is smoking the same batch. Oh well.”"

Comptonasstodd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1431812,"“One of the most potent amazing tasty stony strains I've ever smokes . Royal choice farms kills it with every strain this and lemmonhead og, rolls choice, cherry skunk the list goes on... another superb strain for ppl who are picky .”"
rocketnate,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1380069,"“Top 5 !!! Absolutely gorgeous to just look at. Let's be honest, we do enjoy it first with out eyes. It freakishly has trichs growing on trichs. An orgy of trichromatic wonder. The buds are seemingly felted with crystals. The smell, utterly unique. It can only be interpreted as fresh citrus meets first breath of life in an herbal garden of eden. The first taste, strong but tip of the tongue tangy and sweet. The exhale...”"

Chelseasellsseashellsbytheseashore,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sfv-dog/reviews/1379779,"“Smells like a rotting wet dog. Soooo if you're "into that" then this strain is for you! Otherwise my advice is to stay clear of this mutt! A parallel strain would be Rolls Choice, (A Chemdawg and OG 18 baby) which not only smells better but I think it smokes better too, with harder hitting effects.”"
