hemlocklily,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1379522,"“A classic strain, beloved by pain sufferers everywhere! It is one of the best for relieving pain and anxiety, and it lasts a long time. It's usually the first strain I suggest to people who are new to medical cannabis.”"
TheGreenBaer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1415783,"“The best way I can describe it is it's like a Good cup of coffee, and I'm not talking McDs 1 doller coffee. I'm talking when you wake up and feel like you got run over somehow, even though you know you where in bed all night and even trying to get up is just a energy drainer. Then walk into the kitchen with feet like lead weights ,the sun just burning your retinas like a little kid with a intense laser pointer ,just ...”"
WeedWizard23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1374285,"“Very smooth high with an intense blueberry smell and a mixture of the classical og and my beloved blueberry”"
Mutatedpistils,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1378249,"“Great body high, and despite what the description says, this has a great head high too. Not Sativa-speedy head high, but like happy spacey. Definitely a good Friday evening strain.”"
DankGanj23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1393799,"“Definitely one of the better strains I've had. Indica is dominant to a point and relaxes fatigued muscles a lot better! If you have a sesh with this, get ready to be on your ass.”"
raygreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1380468,"“I think I'll go as far and say, this is hands down one of my favorites. I'm super chill and happy and also kind of zoned out with happy thoughts and I do mean super funny happy thoughts. NO WORRIES WITH THIS ONE. ALL PROBLEMS ARE GONE NOW BIGBABY!!”"
hayden33,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1347513,"“Great strain, gives me a good appetite and a good nights sleep.”"
Sippi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1347514,"“I have the oils from kurvana. It's sweet and at first, a little harsh. Really mellows me out. I can still do my job right after a quick nap in the office”"
ElPresidente420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1367228,"“This strain looks beautiful and smells AMAZING, but what about the high?? the high is great! I almost immediately started feeling happy.”"

nwissinger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1520278,"“Would buy more, loved the high. The smell is a delightful, and enjoyable smack in the face, like a blueberry cheesecake. the buds looked like tiny diamonds were engulfing it, and it was so sticky, and moist which is wonderful because it prolongs a loaded bowl. it relieved pain quick, and gives a let's take on the world feeling.”"
babykii,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1338002,"“Uplifted high at the moment thanks to Blueberry OG! very cloud like, just soothing...I feel all my muscles relaxed and at ease. My head feels spacious and worry free, I'm in a pretty good mood! I'm sure if I went to bed I won't be waking up lol although I'm not exactly tired, I feel a small burst of energy and i can do everything clearly. Just me eyes are bloodshot haha..you NEED to try it I am so stress free ((:”"

DopeBoy2610,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1353657,"“Very tasty blueberry Tate when smoked, especially in a clean glass bong and nice in joints also. The smell is fruity with classic OG aroma. Decent indica dominant body high with relaxing stress relieving and anti anxiety properties helps with appetite and sleeping in higher doses. Awesome strain highly recommended.”"
Tuzky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1655167,"“After 9 weeks of flowering-15 days of flushing before harvest -7 days of drying-2 and half months of curing the taste is so earthy and berry sweet. Not as sweet as expected but really good. Nice head and body high with relaxing effects.Barneys farm did a really nice job. Extremly good yield. huge, tugh buds full of crystals.”"
ArnoldThompson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1328426,"“Good bud to smoke when out n about.”"
Bobo30,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1737539,"“Experienced pretty big creep from this strain, sometime it took a good 10min before it kick in. Which makes it too easy to smoke too much, if that's the kind of thing you worry about.

I don't do well with indica strains, and this hybrid is a tad too heavy on the indica lineage for my taste. It induced a lot of anxiety and paranoid thoughts but those episodes were relatively easy to control since the head high is som...”"

MyJokerHandStayLIT,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1419355,"“Nice strain with a relaxing and chill vibe to it. Definitely not a very active energetically strain yet enough for some not for me personally after two days of use it was not enough stimulation and just became more of a body high”"
VliegendeHollander,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1715302,"“A very easy to smoke strain. Smoking one joint was very enjoyable however nothing really special. Smoked it and enjoyed some music and relaxation. I think the strain is perfect when you and your friends want to hang out relaxing but not be very couch locked, small talk is easy and the effect is an overal happy mood. Perfectly balanced hybrid indeed. If this is what you seek, you can't go wrong with this strain.”"
MrDJWes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1799595,"“To date, this is my favorite hybrid (hell, my favorite strain overall). The high is perfect for me. Great blueberry taste. Nice smooth heady high from the sativa (Sour Diesel) with a relaxing body high from the Indica (Blueberry OG). This is the best of both worlds for me. A true hybrid.”"
Gicester2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1630784,"“Yo this strain has me laughing my ass off. My joint pain has lessened, and I am so giggly and happy that I’ve ordered Uber eats two nights in a row. One of those orders was McDonald’s.

limonene4me,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1668534,"“Just grabbed this and it is some excellent stuff. In the past this would be a 5, but I have now decided to reserve that for the top top top stuff. This is some premium bud and some of the better stuff I have found here in Illinois. 

While its listed as a hybrid, most know that both Blueberry and OG tend to lean towards the Indica side of things. What is interesting is that both strains have similar lineage (want to ...”"
Jacob1447,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1691661,"“The description is right on for this one, good work. You definitely experience dry mouth, lack of appetite, and an indica vibe. I am ambivalent about this bud because there are properties I really like mixed with qualities I really don't, that's why I took a star off.”"
hectikrivero,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-og/reviews/1668158,"“Amazing smell and taste. Gets you going. This is great for that nice head high with energy for the body. GETS ME GOING! Really nice stuff. 👍👍👍👍”"

I was reading some comments, I come across someone trying to explain the head vs body high of this strain right and I keep reading and reading more and more, till I was thinking to my self let me stop reading and write my own crap and make others read all of that...
