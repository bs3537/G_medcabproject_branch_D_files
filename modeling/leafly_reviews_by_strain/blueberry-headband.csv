I have crippling anxiety and OCD and blueberry headband completely takes away my pains and puts me in a dreamy, pleasurable state of euphoria and mental clarity. For once, I'm not over-thinking and over-analyzing everything.

medicineman7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-headband/reviews/1410733,"“Im really loving blueberry headband. For me the buzz was uplifting and very soothing. No couch lock for me and functional. The kind of bud that will leave you with an easy going feeling with a smile all day. No brain fog, paranoia, or anxiety for me. Good for newbies but strong enough for vets. All and all the perfect med for my needs.”"

Good burst of energy along with a pleasant pulsing body high...I would definitely not go to thanksgiving dinner with my girlfriends parents after a blunt.
