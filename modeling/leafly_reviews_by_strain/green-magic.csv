dakemon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-magic/reviews/1536328,"“I had never heard of it, but let me tell ya..... this strain is not for beginners, make sure to note that. Its a very strong euphoria with a very strong pulling body high, which is amazing if you can handle it. I was so in tune with all of my senses, this may seem odd but I think my pupils were like vibrating lol. A very pungent, like veryyyy strong smell. Anyways, the green magic is definitely green magic.”"
TheDrizzzle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-magic/reviews/1538329,"“Stunning!  Tastes and Smells amazingly sweet, mild and "apple-ly".  Very alert, creative, euphoric, top of head high.  As an everydayer for 30 years, this was a nice, surprisingly strong buzz off two bowls.”"
STRWBRY,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-magic/reviews/1630393,"“Green Magic's hit appears out of nowhere, like magic. It has this very smooth opening that just leads to a hyper and strong high. This surprised me in a lot of ways and I love it.”"

The Indica keeps trying to pull you over to the dark side but the sativa is strong with the force.

Probably would not recommend to new smokers in high amounts.”"
