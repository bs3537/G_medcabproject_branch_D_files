Probably 50-75% of the bud is purple, and it smells extremely like Grape.  You can search up a page to see the genetics, it seems to be a cross of Sputnik #1 and Black Russian. Sputnik #1 has Skunk #1 and Apollo 13 derivatives.  I've seen less-potent LOOKING high-grade stuff pack a bigger punch; such as Sweet Tooth, but Doubl...”"

However like many have said the look will draw you in an make you fall in love.  Now the effect from this beautiful flower. Is more of a relaxation effect like harlequin due to its very high CDB%'s However many say it has a grape taste for me. It was more like drinking a nice Porter.

IndecisiveMrIndica,https://www.leafly.com/indica/double-purple-doja/reviews/1254613,"“One of the more tame purples I've ever had.  Smell is similar to a guiness beer, with a very mellow taste that had some spicey overtones.  Mild body high with warmth and tingly feelings at joints and larger muscles- similar to some of the cbd indica strains.  Worked well with my aches, pains, and nerve issues.  Very functional, focused, non-couchlock experience- took 10 mins to set in fully, lasted 75 mins.  Def reco...”"

Beautiful color flower
Doesn't make me too sleepy
Seemed more like an earthy/wood taste
Focused
Thirsty

Great strain”"
okbyekatie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/double-purple-doja/reviews/1374239,"“Good for pain and sleeping, relaxing enough so that you'll become deep in thought as you fall asleep. Moderate body high that was euphoric enough to notice.

One problem with this strain is every time I smoked it before sleeping, I would have very strange seems that would sometimes wake me up.

Other than that it's a decent strain for relaxing/pain.”"
