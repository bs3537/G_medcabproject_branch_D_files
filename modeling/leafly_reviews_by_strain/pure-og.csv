The smoke was sweet, made me cough like an amateur, but I felt the high roll in quick in the head and move through the body. Probably should not have smoked this in the middle of the day. Found finishing my tasks difficult and as soon as I sat down I was asleep and down for the count.

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-og/reviews/1064692,"“Pure OG from 'I.E, The Labs - Highest Tested Meds, I.E' is surprisingly a potent yet mellow smoke, tight dense nug that's slightly sticky and stays that way even after handling. Strong enough to medicate very well but not totally knock you out, until the end after it has driven you tired. Hungry without being ravenously starving, I could eat anything and felt fine with just chewing it forever as it tasted so yummy. L...”"

AgentAK,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-og/reviews/1297010,"“Method of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer 

Pros: Great pain relief and body relaxation. Smooth draw/exhale. Some tiredness that could lead to sleep if needed.

Cons: Some dry mouth. 

Overall: Worked well at killing pain. No real head effects. Pine/Earthy taste. No sativa effects (would be good for those not looking for sativa effects). Body becomes really relaxed, almost numb feeling. Would recommend for body pain.”"
