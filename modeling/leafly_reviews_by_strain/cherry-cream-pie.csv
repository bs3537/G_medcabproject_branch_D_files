Thanks to my girl Misha at Ponder in the CD, I got hooked up with this strain from Green Haven.

It does NOT mess around. After smoking some meh strains from other shops, I have almost forgotten what a true potent strain is! 

Cherry Cream Pie is equal parts silly and happy, but the body high is mellow. Green Haven's strains often have the best terpene profiles--the fragrance and taste is un...”"
MisterPotatoman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1438932,"“This strain is perfect for people who treat chronic pain, restlessness, or anxiety. I've suffered daily pain from Degenerative Disc Disease in my lower back for 17 years with accompanying "blah" moods on really tough days. The lift-off is a very soaring high, followed by a good hour or two of mindless couch-lock which makes for a great evening snooze. Another joint before bed and I can get a full night of sleep. Than...”"
Zannix,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1599872,"“Picked up this strain grown by Harvest in Maryland.  Put it in my pax III and set the temp to 365.  Slowly pull on the vaporizer and find myself at peace. This is a beautiful strain both in appearance and effect.  I am fully relaxed but not tired.  I took the dog on my new strain walk (definitely the best way to evaluate a new strain) and just found myself not worrying about anything and enjoying the views.  Flowers ...”"
melodyblu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1429357,"“This is a nice mellow high strain for sure. I am able to function but not on a high energy level. I am not foggy at all, I have clear thoughts. My mind isn't racing a million miles a minute. That is nice. My muscles are relaxed and I am liking how chill I feel right now. This is some good stuff.”"
highbutterlypig,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1526469,"“TASTE: cherry with cookie/mint/pine
HIGH: calming, relaxing the muscles, cerebral, not too energetic. I’d smoke this to get calm but not too giggly before seeing my family at Christmas. Beginners might become sleepy after smoking but heavy-hitters can expect tranquil and sedate vibes without couchlock.”"

Eberry94,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1640472,"“Picked this up at a dispensary in M.D . Very potent straw in as others has mentioned. You will definitely be relaxed with the powerful euphoria it brings within a matter of seconds.”"

Zipfare,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1703227,"“I Appreciated the density of the smoke and the Buds themselves. Cherry Cream Pie had great potential to be my best buds of the summer. The combo of looking great for the camera and it’s strong earthy terpene profile when u get a few grams in was vital to this Buds well deserved praise”"

UngravitousMako,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1398278,"“Re-evaluation: a friend heard of my negative experience with this strain, and offered me some he'd been curing for a while.  The flavors are MUCH improved, nearly to the point of decadence.  The high is far more potent, though still far from what I would call thorough or satisfying.  still not viable for my conditions.  while earning two more stars for flavor and potency, it really deserves more like a 3.7-3.8 rating...”"
cdsjedi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1483123,"“Very nice strain. It smells good and works well. I found it to be a little "twiggy" but still effective. I alternate this , and Sunshine Daydream to help with my ankle sugery recovery.  Good stuff.”"
idealyelping,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1593806,"“Nice night-ish time strain for me. It provides a nice but not overpowering stoned feeling while restoring my appetite. 
Good for relaxing at the end of the day, and doesn't give me any anxiety.”"

Nuttymeg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1609476,"“So far my favorite strain. Love the taste of cherry and a bit of pine. Works wonders for my chronic pain. Super relaxing with a clear head.”"
flyguy45,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1733604,"“60/40 indica, awesome for the prep phase before finally going to bed 

(relatively low tolerance)

Round dense beautiful deep purple nugs.”"
DontTouchThatCantHaveIt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1482047,"“Disgusting.  Smells like Cherry cough drops.  Absolutely nothing like weed. 

I bought this from Health for Life in Mesa, Az.   I know for certain this is NOT the plant a natural scent of flavor. 

Sorry for the negative review but I have to draw attention to this issue every way I can: They are artificially flavoring bud that has no smell of its own! All over the state!  Almost all the meds have a fake smell!  All s...”"
thepurpleme,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1668929,"“Great for headaches!!  I am very headache prone, including migraines, and this strain does the trick.  The other effects  definitely lean more on the indica side; relaxing, munchies, etc. but I don't care as long as that headache is gone.  ;)”"
ChrisKali,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1684677,"“Thanks so much to Sunrise Wellness for the recommendation, I love this strain! Smokes and tastes beautiful and has a hint of mandarin and spice if you ask me. Lots of terpenes, caked and perfectly cured and flushed. Very calming in mind and body, I was focused and uplifted. I’ve added this to my faves and hope to find it again 👍🏻”"
Toker73,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1691241,"“5/10 head high
7.5 body buzz

If you want to get stuff done and want a decent buzz this strain is great. Nice flavours vannila and cherry,  not harsh at all coming out of bong.
If your looking for sleep relief this isnt great but for anxiety and bipolar it does the job. No paranoia at all.”"
GaryJP,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1787891,"“Great strain for ms while not beconing a zombie like hybrids of indica.  Good for micro dosing.
Sorta like wonderinh why shit doesn't bother you, you wonder if your still floating... then three netve firings. .oh yea still stoned.....?”"
UngravitousMako,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cream-pie/reviews/1414261,"“I must have recieved a particularly poor cut.  While having decent bag appeal, this strain tasted more like Cherry Garlic Skunk Anus.  Although testing around 19%, the high was weak and uninspiring, nor did it show promise for my particular medical needs.  Rarely do I regret purchasing a new strain, but I'd be lying if I said I was eager to give this one another chance.
Method: vaporized with a Firefly2”"
