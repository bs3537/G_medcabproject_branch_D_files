jebadave,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/key-lime-haze/reviews/1157486,"“I felt a really strong, lingering body high with this one. Very tingly and euphoric. The head high crept in a little later and was just a nice creative and happy high without being overwhelming. Love the citrus scent and flavor when smoked.”"
SophieWaring96,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/key-lime-haze/reviews/1265364,"“Had this from The Bluebird coffeeshop in Amsterdam with my boyfriend a few days ago. I can confidently say that it was the nicest bud I've ever had. I prefer sativa strains, and this one was recommended by the girl behind the counter. As I said I had it with my boyfriend. We didn't feel like couch potatoes, we explored the city with smiles on our faces and we enjoyed the euphoria. It tasted lovely, and kept us uplift...”"

Very little known about this strain but I received a batch and it’s phenomenal!! The buds look like textbook indica, dark green with dark orange fibres laced throughout, and the high is the perfect 50/50 which leads me to say this is actually an Hybrid. It smells like grass, reminding me of classic, highschool weed and the high has been nostalgic af! Don’t let this regu...”"

In the beginning, it was very fragrant and gave a fairly intense head high that lasted for a few hours.

After the first week, though, it didn't seem to have the same punch that it once had. We found ourselves needing more medicine for the same desired effect.

The fragrance was nice, a very clean citrus scent with a hint...”"

emoareelmo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/key-lime-haze/reviews/1072862,"“Extremely dank/pungent smell. Filled my room almost instantly when I opened it. Bud looks really nice, crystals and orange hairs upon close inspection. The smell could be a little better though, as it doesn't match the obvious lime smell of the flower. I give this a 4/5”"
betterwithkushna,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/key-lime-haze/reviews/1205573,"“Phenomenal strain! I would highly recommend breaking it up with your bare thumbs instead of grinding it up bc the tricomes on it enhance the experience 10x”"

sirmisterjay,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/key-lime-haze/reviews/1638997,"“3.5 🌟 (needs to be out of 10 leafly) it’s unexpectedly & surprisingly tasty but not as good as Amnesia Haze for me personally.”"
OIF1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/key-lime-haze/reviews/1714449,"“Great haze cross! Nice size buds, leaving a lot of hash on grind, which is awesome! Relaxing and pleasant for a Sativa. Easy to hit, hits back even harder. Nice for pain, better for killing anxiety!”"
emoareelmo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/key-lime-haze/reviews/1168626,"“Pungent smell, smoke smells a little different though. Bud had orange hairs and crystallized.”"
goatroapr,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/key-lime-haze/reviews/1156104,"“A touch of lime flavor is nice on the nose.  This Hybrid Sativa is enough to give you an energy boost by not too much that your eyes water and you have enough energy to run a marathon (although those are great at times).

Drying and Curing spot on!”"

Echo1337,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/key-lime-haze/reviews/1158054,"“Beautiful sweet buds, large and dense with vibrant orange hairs. The buds smelled strongly of Lime, and the smoke even had a lime after taste. The bud was very strong and gave a huge head high. In my experience it was a bit too intense. My body felt tingly and I felt a little bit anxious and paranoid. If smoked in a lower quantity I could definitely see this strain being used to treat depression and to handle stress.”"
rach2540,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/key-lime-haze/reviews/1200751,"“Amazing. The only negative comment I would leave, is that it made me a little nauseated. But great taste, great high.”"
