Smells good, tastes nice, and the high is phenomenal. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a "fun" hybrid.”"
Koopday,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1519646,"“One of my certified favorites! I had tried Bear Dance many months ago and really enjoyed it. It was only at one dispensary at that time so I was a little conservative with it because I enjoyed it so much. Long story short I had to find it again. it's been around here for a little while at a few places now with slightly different phenotypes.  Feel: a heavy Happy and Relaxation feel immediately with a nice head buzz th...”"

douglashadtopoop,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1482060,"“It's both euphoric and grounded at the same time, if that makes sense. I bought this a week ago when I was drunk in the afternoon and took it home and played video games for several hours. Tonight I am dealing with my very sick cat and worried out of my mind, and it took me to an objective and focused place that I needed to be. Body effect is a pretty typical 70/30ish sativa hybrid high. Mentally it is one of the mos...”"

Had an onion of it would def grab anuva if I get the chance ! The taste is quite addictive and high is energetic and has good kick !”"
roundabout19,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1627890,"“Bear Dance is a strain with beautiful large dense dark green nugs with orange hairs. There is not much info available yet on this strain but it certainly gave me an energetic sativa like buzz and allowed me to stay focused on any daytime activities. Highly recommend to all!”"

KupoCoffee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1593617,"“This strain makes you laugh harder than you ever thought it could. It makes foods taste like you’re on a new level just to be able to eat them. It makes your body uncontrollably rock the fuck out to Italian metal bands. I sipped my tea on the glorious warmth of the moon. Into a world of dreams where, once again I’ll meet my long lost star -Bear Dance.”"
KupoCoffee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1593027,"“This is by far my favorite strain to date. I felt so incredibly happy. Everything that I love was deeply amplified and so much better than normal. I listened to my favorite band in headphones and I rocked the F out. The music took over my soul and I heard elements to the songs I had never heard before. I ate a chocolate lava cake and i have never tasted anything so good in my entire life. I was involuntarily saying “...”"

Bcormier,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1655557,"“It was definitely a giggly and uplifting high. I'm a big fan of hybrids and this one felt extremely balanced to me. Just chilled, watched a comedy, and laughed my ass off.”"
BurnapoundTighteyesAKAChronnieHighler,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1557878,"“This hybrid live sugar from Revolution puts the spring back in my step after a long, exhausting day and works great as a refreshing post-workout or to punctuate more cerebral creative tasks like writing with occasional breaks. Light-bodied with an herbaceous flavor profile comprised of cucumber, lemon peel, and banana leaf, Bear Dance provides a billowing lift supported by a jab of CBN that awakens the appetite as we...”"

Careful it will sneak up on you !!”"
Girl44Interrupted,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1665530,"“Smoked this with my friend Shane and I am happily surprised with the effects of this strain. Very head high but total awareness man. And no pain or anxiety or depression either! Great strain.”"

rachelala,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1610040,"“This has been my favorite strain lately. The taste is great, a little sweet and fruity but sometimes a little more earthy. The effect is right down the middle. I like to do chores with it but I'm also happy watching tv or playing video games.”"
atrueblood1984,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1707802,"“One of very few true 5 star strains in my opinion. Great full bodied high, with just enough kick to keep you from getting couchlock in microdose. In heavy doses this hits you like a freight train. Has just a hint of lemon pine with a strong earthy undertone similar to afhgan strains.”"
ziggypop75,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1709349,"“Fantastic sativa-leaning hybrid.  Very flavorful and provides an energetic and happy high with pain-reduction.  After trying dozens of strains from the local IL dispensary, this is one of my favorite daytime buds.”"
cduley,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1519199,"“Really good earthy strain. Have some photos ive attached but leafly seems to not want to put them up for some reason. Ive had the Flower,shatter and live resin. All are great especially the live resin.”"
highly_doobious,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1798121,"“Loving the Bear Dance! Terrific strain for focused energy with enough indica undertones to keep it mellow. Poppin' floral hints ride below a mellow herbal exhale.”"
gosgood,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1806671,"“This batch was cured very nicely, with dry stems and long bulbous trichomes. Some variation in frost/red hair ratio. Glistens throughout. Nose of green tea. Taste of spicy lemon and rose hips. Smooth inhale.  First felt effects in less than 20 seconds. 2-3 minutes for more. Nice sustained high.”"
KushQueenElizabeth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1804490,"“Beautiful zesty and pine taste packed with a  euphoric high!”"
Lindsey328,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1754063,"“This has a very nice earthy aroma and looks amazing! Very nice fresh buds. When I first tried this strain I was suprised because THCa% being 18.477%! It could be a daily go to but for sure a get the day started up n talkative strain. Not real mind altering or sedating. . . Very smooth!”"
NaturalProgression,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bear-dance/reviews/1790717,"“This is a Sativa dominant hybrid that will give you the relaxing benefits of an Indica while allowing a more experienced smoker to maintain a solid amount of focus and energy thanks to the Sativa end. I don't know if I would recommend this one to new smokers, at least not at the thc levels I experienced. 

It's a great tasting, smooth strain with a relatively subtle 'clean nature' smell. 

Highly Recommend for Experi...”"
