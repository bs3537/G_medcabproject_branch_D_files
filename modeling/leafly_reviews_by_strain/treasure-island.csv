Treasure Island
=============
EvanYYC,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1410637,"“This was a pleasant but odd surprise. Even on balance strains I still get a bit of the THC head buzz. It's manageable, but it's there. On this strain, it's very, very faint. Faint to the point where you don't feel "high". This was both trying it by vape and also trying it by smoking a bowl.

The breakdown I was given on this blend from my dispensary was a potential of 14.21% CBD, and 1.06% THC.

The effect? At first ...”"
DrDave11,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1438657,"“Treasure Island provides noticeable pain relief and a reassuring sensation of wellness with a short-lived high and only a minor sense of impairment ... much like a joint of my home-grown Humboldt County weed from the 1970s.  After smoking a carefully measured 1 grain (1/15 gram) portion of flower in a K-Vape at 421 degrees, it feels as though I've consumed aspirin, alcohol, and caffeine all at the same time.  My ounc...”"
brifaulkner86,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1533517,"“Love that there is no couch lock, which for me, means no anxiety or panic attack. Greatly relaxes the muscles and eases nerve pain. Definitely a medicinal strain, not for heavier users looking for a high, you won’t find it here. But, you will get some good pain relief and relaxation.”"
mrdpatt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1410638,"“Great for relaxing in the evening when you don't want the sleeping effects of a strong indica or the jitters from an energetic sativa. 

These hybrid has a throaty hit and mellow favor. I enjoy smoking this bud out of a water bong.”"
atomicdog69,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1515979,"“Lots of fun to grow. A hearty plant. Low, sparse branches with wide, dark green leaves indicative of a strong indica influence. The flavor is peppery, and can be a bit harsh, with aftertaste of licorice. The head buzz is light and short-lived, but the effect overall is a strong body high. Ideal for novice smokes, those put of by the anxiety that can be caused by sativa-dominant strains or patients in search of relief...”"
-Jimbo--,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1576653,"“Great strain, really worked to relieve the stress of life and almost immediate killed the pain in my knees. I am a fan of the high CBD strains so the lack of a head high really made my day I was able to keep getting my projects done.”"
canadient83,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1743165,"“Bought under the name "Free" by Solei.  First thing I noticed was that it smelled like lemon candy.  I vaporized 2 bowls (low tolerance) and wasn't really high per se, but definitely had a bit of a buzz.  The "high" was mostly just relaxing, great to just hang out and watch cartoons or play video games, as you're still functional. Good introductory strain.”"
BRECEDA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1410636,"“A really light high, great for smoking whole joints without getting too high. Head buzz is super short lived but it gives a full body relaxation.”"
FirLam,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1572430,"“The one I tried was THC 0.6 and CBD 16.5.  
Despite the low THC content, in comparison to other strains -in terms of effect, this is a 5 Start Sativa, with loads of CBD to benefit from. A great choice.”"
Veganlove,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1740735,"“I am typically not a pot smoker and was afraid to get high, so this strain is perfect for just a relaxing tingly chillout. I thought it would help me sleep since it’s meant to relax you, but even though my eyes want to close my brain isn’t letting them. Perhaps it’s best taken in earlier hours of the day. All in all, I like it, it’s definitely relaxing.”"
scottypolyoculi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1751194,"“Hands down one of my favorites, but not for recreational reasons. I keep a jar of it on hand at all times. Ideal for daily anxiety and stresses, aches or pains. It also seems to heighten mind/muscle connection so it increases engagement in physical activities. This is top shelf, use specific, does what it claims type stuff right here. Get it.”"
ninelions,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1734389,"“selected this strain specifically for the high cbd content and was not disappointed. very relaxing, but still with plenty of focus and energy with a little touch of a body high. no head buzz at all for me. would recommend for pain, anxiety and stress relief. has become a fast favorite for when I don't want to be really stoned but want to enjoy the effects.”"
KaysPJs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1723653,"“I grabbed this up for the high CBD content and boom! After 4 hits off a joint I was so high. I felt absolutely no pain, but I had to get up and keep going, the Indica makes you want to sit and relax but the other makes it so you need to get up and keep busy. Super Focused on projects, but couldn't truly concentrate.
All in all, was NOT expecting to get that stoned!”"
Entistic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1784415,"“This is what convinced me about medical cannabis.  Bought as "Free" by Soleil from Aphria.  This strain murders a weather pressure headache within seven minutes.  Autistic people and other people who have sensory sensitivity disorders, give this one a look - this slays my sensory hyper-sensitivity, takes less than an hour to make everything bearable again - light, sounds, touch (no more wanting to claw my skin off), ...”"
Freshsqueezednugz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1749731,"“First time I’ve grown this strain. Stays very short, very easy, no real issues. Topped it a couple times, and added a little vegan mix to soil. Compost tea once a week. She seemed to like to be pushed a little longer for nice Trich. Development. Structure seemed to be a bit more indica with this pheno. Aroma is very earthy, with a slight touch of lightly burnt grapefruit peel. Vape taste is very smooth, and with eart...”"
Brook.Hilena,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1797183,"“I bought from the BC Online Government store and this product went under the name “Free” and was produced by Solei by Aphria inc.  The container it came in was cute and arrived in 3 days.  There were no full buds and the nugs were not very dense and a little dry.  As it is Sativa, it feels uplifting but because of the low THC content (0.55%) I do not feel much of a high.  It definitely helps with the anxiety I have f...”"
Dano09,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1736201,"“This was my first time to grow this strain. We got a late start for about  two weeks
Just got it all Harvested two plants got about 4 lbs”"
zachcroft6,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/treasure-island/reviews/1552783,"“I did this once before but I only did one little rip with a bottle bong and it never really got me high but it made me relax and made me feel chill. I recommend if you are just bored and wanna have a quick smoke and chill out. Over all I like it but I prefer THC over CBD”"
