BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/east-coast-alien/reviews/1396405,"“A very good morning/mid day smoke, ECA normally has high THC content ranging in the mid 20%. Definitely has strong diesel aroma, light green coated in gorgeous white trichromes with some orange hairs. Good for staying productive, you can still function.”"

I have used this medication before and can say that it is a very potent medication with all the Sativa attributes you'd expect but with a sedating effect if you don't get out and do something or smoke too much.  Flavor and smoke are pleasant.  Great overall medication for what ails you.  The cut I've been enjoying is tested at 25%+ and is very ...”"

A true sativa-dominant strain in every traditional sense of the phrase. And a very quality powerful strain assuming it's grower knew half of what he was doing. Blankets and layers of keef like I have never seen 10/10”"

LotusKai,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/east-coast-alien/reviews/1705895,"“Holy cow what a POTENT strain this is! It takes 2 powerhouse strains and makes them better! The buds look like a typical diesel shape, cone with fingers coming off. Color is a deep green with tight dark orange hairs and covered in white trichomes. It doesn't reek of diesel despite the NYCD in it, more of a slight stink of it underneath a mellow musky tone. The high is great NYCD head high with a fairly powerful (but ...”"

The fact that I paid less than five dollars a gram didn't hurt. Big fat verdant buds with the requisite crystals and red/orange hairs. Breaks up nicely for rolling. Really no complaints.”"

It knows how to help one take life less seriously and can be definitely ungrounding.”"
deftonesdexy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/east-coast-alien/reviews/1627301,"“Great for daytime use. Keeps you calm and euphoric yet active and moving. This is great for my yoga sessions when I want to remain focused and intuned with my poses and breathing. Also great for working those long shifts at work. Keeps you uplifted and stress free and very in the moment. One of my favorite sativas.”"
