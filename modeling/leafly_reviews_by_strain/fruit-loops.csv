catwhisperer420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-loops/reviews/1414176,"“being someone who suffers from chronic pain and PTSD I have found eating some of a  froot loops bar, I do get some decent pain control as well as being able to get some sleep. I'm just now starting w/ edibles & I have to say I am more than pleasantly surprised. I did find myself quite chatty with my physical therapist today so I can vouch for what I read in the effects description. But the best thing is being able to...”"

Okay, let me just begin by saying that fruit loops are one of the nicest looking strains out there - Blue, Purple, Red, Silver trichomes  coating the entire nug. In terms of it's 'medicinal' value, very very uplifting strain for being an indica, good day time relaxation that's not gonna make you fall asleep, also very good at helping with anxiety and appetite loss. I'd say this is like the xanax of ma...”"
HalieNeal420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-loops/reviews/1412048,"“This is one of the best smelling and tasting strains I've ever tried 😍 no complaints with this beauty. a very good strong high that will leave you satisfied! Glad I got to try this while it was available very recommended!”"
PumpkinGemini11,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-loops/reviews/1388095,"“I really liked this strain. No anxiety or paranoia. Good for daytime. Tastes and smells great.”"
LeroyBrown420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-loops/reviews/1412047,"“Wow, I can totally dig these Fruity loops. Mild Indica even when rolled into a 1 gram hash-stick. Amazing aromatics, not very sedating, has a great Sativa mind twist that promotes happiness. Plus a cool name that matches her lovely smell.”"
eweinberg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-loops/reviews/1387566,"“The stuff I had from Nectar was unlike any other bud I've seen... I kid you not from an 1/8th I gathered nearly a full gram of kief! This stuff is like white powder. Hands down my favorite strain this far.”"

MamaRV,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-loops/reviews/1388091,"“Was really looking forward to this strain, as I'm a fan of it's parent strains (Blue Dream, Grapefruit, Blueberry, White Widow).  My batch was a little harsh, but sweet on the exhale.  I was, however, a little let down by this strain.  Don't get me wrong, it provides a cerebral buzz with a mellow body high, but for me, it was just 'meh'.”"

HerbeHeureuse,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-loops/reviews/1388094,"“Tonite I'm smoking on Fruit Loops, and indica dominant hybrid, that true to its name tastes like Froot Loops cereal - a sort of dull yet tasty fruit taste but that's what happens when they get dunked in milk, right?

Mine tested at 19.30% THC and .02 % CBD. I'm definitely feeling  heaviness in my head and  a nice couch lock coming on, making this a very nice bedtime strain.  There's a cerebral quality to this one too...”"
Highvet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-loops/reviews/1284653,"“This strain is almost like Girl Scout Cookie! Nice mellow body high that reaches up to your temples! Grab a 1/4 of this, go to your favorite fast food, go home, turn on a dope ass movie and Boom.......nothing else matters!!! Cheers!”"

Solid all around fix... may need a bit more than normal to feel the effects, then you realize it takes effect slower due to it's balance and now you are really baked.  Very even balance of flowery goodness.”"

Smoke was a bit harsh in the throat but the high was fairly good. Clear and focused on the onset, settling into happy, mildly euphoric, calm. Leaves you relaxed, but not lazy.”"
Yonex420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fruit-loops/reviews/1657885,"“i give this strain 5 stars mainly because of its aroma of actual fruits ans berries permiates throughout. However the smoke was a bit harsh and they indica effects were a 5 outta 10 for my personal taste. Huge dense nugs of bright green with amber hairs slight hints of Purple.

I find it to be a medium smoke with a nice sweet/berry taste, I can see where the name comes from. I get a nice euphoric head high, followed by a mellow sensation that keeps me talking more than normal. This is great for morning/day use.”"

Loved the taste 
Didn’t make me anxious whatsoever

I never really know how a strain is gonna affect me. I loved the side effects of Fruit Loops 110%, I’m not disappointed. Definitely would smoke this again. Absolutely no anxiety or paranoia. Got me the right amount of high without that much bud. Love it.”"
