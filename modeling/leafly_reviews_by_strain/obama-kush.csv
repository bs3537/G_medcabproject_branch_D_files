Every time I smoke it, I end up getting very intense about anything I'm doing and forget I've been doing it for longer than intended.
Possibility of paranoia if smoke too much of it.
Good for migraines and will def make you sleep.

A little skunky, but it worth it. The effect is at first a little like with other kush strains, but after 10 minutes the full effect roles through the body and a warmth a calm settles in for about 90 minutes - 2 hours.

I never liked to smoke A LOT as it didn't do anything special. Obama Kush changed that for me wish I was smoking 24/7-...”"

That said, I acquired a small amount of this as a sample, from a source I failed to record. Very nice well balanced strain. Relaxing and clear, focused at the same time. Possible anxiety for light weights I would guess.”"
