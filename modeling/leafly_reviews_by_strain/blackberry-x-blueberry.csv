dankguy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-x-blueberry/reviews/1339918,"“While maybe not a 5 star it is a very nice strain... One of those u don't wanna stop smelling after grinding... Definitely an indica but not "couch- locky" ... Very nice strain.”"
Gracelikerain18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-x-blueberry/reviews/1428346,"“Very nice strain. Bought some in Trinidad, CO at Livwell. I felt relaxed but not sleepy, nice body high. Perfect for watching Rick and Morty reruns and snacking.”"

First note here this strain is HEAVY INDICA and it don't play around. I burnt not 1 but 2 different sheets of 20 something pizza rolls while zombified on this late night. I do not suggest naps in between munchies because you will forget really fast. In the good aspect this strain is amazing for thos...”"

 not a bummer. high was nice mixed. potencey was lacking but that could just be me. Will give you some m nice naps and also can be a bit heady. overall I enjoyed this strain.”"

TokeBuzz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-x-blueberry/reviews/1304682,"“A very solid strain ! You have purple swirling around through light green hairs which are all blanketed heavy with white crystals. Has a natural sweet smell like actual berries and a bit of purgency. The taste is like a dried blueberry as is almost a perfect balance but leaning more towards the indica side. This is something you want to smoke when the moon is shining”"

I see the light!... Well, actually may not be seeing light for long as this one does have me sleepy ... But I see the beauty of this sweet strain.”"
Brian86514,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-x-blueberry/reviews/1801910,"“Good strain of flower. I always get those nice big dense frosty buds when I purchase from LivWell. I prefer smoking this strain in joints. It's not one of my favorite strains but I'll smoke this bud anytime.”"
MonkeyLo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-x-blueberry/reviews/1641469,"“Gold shelf from LivWell. I got an 1/8 from livwell n Cortez it's the only strain that cought my eye at the time.  had to get a sample. the budtender was trying to give me the smaller popcorn nugs.. I had to get the big Betty nugs outta the stash. was good n taste. very Berry. but the bath at the time was too dry. I had to rehydrate with Integra Boost pack b4 I decided to enjoy. I don't think I be getting more.”"

Booboo24,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-x-blueberry/reviews/1768470,"“Full body relaxation. Good for sleep but not really for anything else. I’m not an indica person anyway so I think that made me dislike this strain more.”"

Great night time dank 
Wasn’t feeling no pain afterwards so it made the sore muscles 💪 feel better. Reminded me of “Hot Butta”

What makes this strain amazing is that, unlike some or most indicas, you can smoke it during the day (as long as you don't overdo it) and be totally alert and awake (but relaxed at the time) as long as you stay busy. However, the minute or 2 you spend sitting down could very possibly most likely m...”"
MedicalIncredible,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-x-blueberry/reviews/1361128,"“Gonna disagree with almost everything the info page says. 

Blackberry x Blueberry # 5 was nothing special. 2.5 stars 

Stringy, Ground Black Pepper-y, harsh inhale, not sweet, not flavorful, etc 

I smell/taste 0% Oregon Blueberry (but am not questioning it's pedigree) 

Almost middle of the road weed for a Colorado Medical Patient, I'd put it in the bottom 40% of strains 
But, it won't be turned down in the sticks ...”"
