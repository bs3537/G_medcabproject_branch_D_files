Alexandrabmunoz5,https://www.leafly.com/indica/double-og/reviews/1673671,"“Made me feel very light-spirited.  Not sure if this actually gave me the munchies or if I was just really hungry from the day, but I ATE.  Very dense nugs, with a sweet yet sour aroma.  It definitely had that under the radar skunk smell, and the taste was sweet and earthy like I’d hoped for.  Great for a sweet and sound sleep - made my body feel yummy and lucid.”"
