Space Dawg
=============
Sapphyy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/space-dawg/reviews/1385377,"“Space Dawg was a strain I picked up because my Bud-tender recommended it to me. I asked for something that would put me to sleep and reduce pain and that's exactly what it did. The smell is very strong. The kind of bud that as soon as you open the jar the room reaks. Fuelly smell with a sweet taste. Had me really spacey for about 30 minutes as I finished up the movie I had been watching than it put me right to sleep....”"
doctorxcompanion,https://www.leafly.com/indica/space-dawg/reviews/1391574,"“If you really wanna relax, take a "ME" day, or just fall back into the REM sleep statis...choose Space Dawg. 1-2 bowls will knock you rite back to sleep, if you smoke a blunt, I suggest not driving. Space Dawg has got to be one of my favorite flowers, next to Cherry Pie in Indica's, to all you readers out there, DON'T PASS UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY THIS FLOWER!!!”"
VJvalvenus420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/space-dawg/reviews/1360005,"“I really enjoy this strain. Nice size nugz, dense but not rock hard. I was surprised 2 taste the suttle notes of bubble gum towards the end of exhaling.  Leafly has done a great job so far of trying their best to describe each and every strain there is out there. (theres alot lol!) So Thank you LEAFLY 4 ALL your hard work. LOVE&PEACE ♡♡♡”"

CheriesSmile,https://www.leafly.com/indica/space-dawg/reviews/1326941,"“Love this one!
Space Dawg helps very much with pain and stress! Just 3-5 tokes.   I feel a little lazy but can still find enough ambition (if I don't smoke too much) to start something and stay focused.”"
Diebythesword7,https://www.leafly.com/indica/space-dawg/reviews/1360004,"“This funky smelling bud looked slightly stringy but covered in crystals. the stringiness didnt deter me because my guy only supplies 100% medical stuff to me. glad i picked it up, this packs a powerful and uplifting head high, without creating sluggishness smoking it after a long days work (butcher) in the evening. it actually tastes better than the flowers smell, and totally melts away your stress and fatigue at the...”"
emmyspeaks,https://www.leafly.com/indica/space-dawg/reviews/1360003,"“I tried this from a friend, and wasn't disappointed. Hit me fast, made me cough, left me with a lasting high. Definitely can feel the indica effects, and did make me giggly. Not a strain I would smoke if I needed to be going about my day. More of a night time, or laid-back party/chilling strain.”"
Naetoven,https://www.leafly.com/indica/space-dawg/reviews/1339780,"“This is some forreal bomb ars indica! I was contemplating purchasing this strain just because of the name, but good googooly moogooly this strain is Juiceeeeee, ha ha. On a serious note, I suffer from neck pain and left shoulder pain from a bad muscle strain playing Pool, within the first  minutes of smoking a firmly tightened joint, I immediately feel the tension lifting up and I'm able to type reviews like such!

ShamrockSulli,https://www.leafly.com/indica/space-dawg/reviews/1221348,"“My favorite all time daytime med. It kind of had a reverse effect of most indica dominant hybrids and gave me the most pain free energy I have had since before my back injuries. Phenotypes varied slightly in smell (juicy fruit gum to rotted fruit mixed with vomit) but the effect was vet stable. I grew my own and consistently was in the low 18% s for thc.”"

Evan38,https://www.leafly.com/indica/space-dawg/reviews/1654480,"“This is probably the most aptly named strain I have come across. I vaped about 1/4 gram and proceeded to stare at my aquarium for about 10 mins before I realized I was even doing it. It's not spacey in a heavy stoned way but more in a clean soft way that just let's your mind wander. A lot of strains that have this kind of mind wandering effect make me a little anxious and stressed ( running all the things I need to d...”"
GoblinSkull,https://www.leafly.com/indica/space-dawg/reviews/1531921,"“Best indica dominant strain I’ve had.  Vaporized in a Flowermate v5.0s.  Produced far more vapor than other strains I have had.  I was able to revape a few times on a single fill of my Flowermate.

Flavor best described as sweet fresh cut grass, I do not mean this in a negative way, the flavor is by no means unpleasant.”"

PhantomSpaceman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/space-dawg/reviews/1253583,"“Space Dawg is great for chilling out and listening to music or playing video games. A potent indica with a piney, fruity aroma, Space Dawg's powerful body high melted my anxiety and depression. Not my go-to for sleep (Yoda OG wins out in that category), I prefer the Dawg for its euphoric and relaxing effects. Definitely a unique strain with diverse range of ancestors, you should definitely try this one before you kno...”"
