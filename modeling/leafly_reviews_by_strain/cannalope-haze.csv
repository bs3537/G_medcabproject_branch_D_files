Im pairing this with Willy's Wonder to counter the effects. Really its visa versa mostly. Willy's Wonder is very a strong indica for bed. About 2 or 3 bong rips of this though and one is ready to face the day's bullshit. Very nice sativa.

This strain is extremely uplifting and can cause some to become quite giggly. The fruity aroma and flavor is extremely apparent when smoking or vaping this bud.

When you first hit it, you'll start feeling the effects within 5 or 10 minutes only. A head rush with euphoric thoughts and a comforting sense of happiness.

This was one of the best hazes I have ever smoked no doubt.”"
