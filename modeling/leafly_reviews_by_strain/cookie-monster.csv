I've never seen anything this purple, not even coming close to Death Star or GDP. Very kiefy from the outside in. Peeling apart a nug gives beautiful waxy strands. The high itself is very cerebral and leaves you with a nice residual floating feeling throughout your body.”"

Smelled sort of like cologne and sort of cheesy.  Definitely a night time smoke. On nights where I would smoke a bowl out of my bong, I would lay in bed with a smile on my face until I drifted into some of the best sleep of my life. Definitely would buy again”"

Vape Cartridge: Golden XTRX Cookie Monster (CO2)

Battery: Cultivated Industries

Aroma & Flavor:
A sweet, frankincense and pine aroma/flavor on the draw.  After three draws or so, a nice lingering hashy flavor.  Though it tasted good, it vaped rather harsh.

Experience:
This one was a bit of a creeper.  Takes about 15 minutes for full effects to kick in.  The head high is fleeting and merely a di...”"

I would definitely recommend this strain!!!”"

I can function in the house and get work done or watch 30 Rock marathons. It's like that warm, perfect blanket, for my indica peeps. Effects crest and end after about three hours. Perfect for a lazy afternoon or if you have insomnia. STRONG munchies though, if you care about that (I don't).”"

GeneralNonsense,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cookie-monster/reviews/1306730,"“This strain made me give absolutely zero fucks about anything. 

Great euphoric effect. Strong body high. 

Lasted for a long time. (I wanna say close to 3-4 hours) but that could have also been an effect that I just lost all sense of time. Who knows. 

Great for evening wind down or relaxing on the weekend. Probably not the strain you wanna use if you have things to do.”"

This was an excellent daytime strain for me, the only thing that hits me wrong is that it goes straight to my head - I ended up with a headache, but not bad enough to never smoke it again when my pain gets to be too much.  It smells like dirty feet, pine, a hint of mint, and fairly pungent.  It had a ...”"

Nice high with a short bout of medium psychosis but only mild paranoia and it was fleeting; very heavy munchies which was bad (trying to lose some weight).

I had this as part of 2 rosin rocket pre-rolls. Would not purchase again. 

Would recommend if you are looking for something to boose appetite.”"
