Every one except for this one. Maybe that's due to its relative dearth of THC. Maybe it's due to the excess of CBD. Maybe both; I don't know.

It is difficult for me to put my finger on exactly what happens when I use it.  I can tell you certain things that I absolutely do NOT experience.  I do NOT get anxious, I do NOT get paranoid.

Paranomalous,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/charlottes-web/reviews/1373647,"‚ÄúWith a strong, pine-y scent and a strong, long-lasting high, this is one of my favorite sativa strains.

I have an extremely low tolerance to weed, and I mean extreme. I use cannabis every day and I remain super-sensitive.

HazeCraze,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/charlottes-web/reviews/1693214,"‚ÄúClearly this CW isn't the Stanley brother's creation. The CW strain that's out there is just in name only. The caveat is not to trust the name, I wouldn't purchase CW anywhere because I know it's probably just another ditch weed hybrid that's been hijacked in order to sell it to unsuspecting users who think they're getting the real CW. Stick to tried and true CBD strains, not the hype surrounding the name.‚Äù"

The prerolls are good too.

snaccman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/charlottes-web/reviews/1630283,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve been smoking this strain almost daily for about a month now. Where I buy mine grows it with around 5%-7% THC and around 24% CBD. This makes for a very mild body and head high. It‚Äôs a FANTASTIC sleep aid, even though it is a Sativa.
