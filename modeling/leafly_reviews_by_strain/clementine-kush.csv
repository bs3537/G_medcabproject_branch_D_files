If you wanna clean the house, this strain is your orange pledge. You get a great orange taste and smell with the musky Kush smell all stoners love!!”"
GGAlice,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1398671,"“I am not sure if some of this was caused by an interaction with my medication (Lamictal), but I did not have a good experience.  I became really nervous and paranoid on it.”"
Hondo13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1398670,"“I absolutely love this strain. It is super stoney as all hell. Watch out though this is a creeper. I only took three hits off it and was super stoned. Excellent pain relief as well for me. I mixed it with some R5 cbd and I feel great. Felt the high in my face right away, made my face all tingly then the body high set in really good. This is my new favorite.”"
Hondo13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1397062,"“after smoking more of this I did not get the same effect as the first time. This is a real heady high with a slight body high. Nice and relaxed though, made my pain stop. Taste is super.”"

BamfXBlazer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1398672,"“Big, frosty, hairy nugs, that pack a hell of a punch! Has a scent of fresh Tangerines, mixed with a scent of rain. I'm not really all for the taste honestly, but the high is great! Lasted a good 2 hours with a calm relaxing body high, mixed with an almost psychedelic head high that creeps up about 15 minutes after a good couple hits.”"

dankguy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1372867,"“Really nice bud... good for chilling out but doesn't lock you down or keep you from being functional... definitely a heady buzz but nice body relaxation as well... I will enjoy the rest of my 1/2 O.”"
helllllobrooke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1279497,"“This strain is amazing! Smells like fruit and tastes exactly like oranges. Only smoked one bowl and I got super high, like as high as I would on dabs. Only downside is I got this because its supposed to be an indices dominant strain but to me it felt more like a saliva dominant.”"
Gramswild,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1647116,"“The taste is great, especially when vaping flower in my pax unit.  I recommend this strain for just kicking back and relaxing. Had a long day and this helped me chill out nicely.”"
Ymdirani68,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1781354,"“It made me super hungry it was ridiculous!!!  Also sleepy and calm   Tastes amazing too”"
TopSarge,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1546332,"“Checked out Billo in Steamboat Springs and picked up a pre-roll of this along with some other goodies. We purchased it on the fly...kind of like some of the stuff you grab in the checkout lane  y'know? It sounded decent, so what the hell eh?
The wife and I would probably give it a 3.5 rating if we could, but it leaned a little closer to a 4 just because it was fairly smooth and tasted decent. It may have been better ...”"

Oldbudguru,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1585607,"“The strain makes me feel hyper-critical. Very different type of High. Bought it on the Tange lineage.”"
MotherEarth78,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1672581,"“Totally an amazing strain I typically enjoy indica's for my MS this has a mouth watering sweet orange flavor that intensifies as you exhale! (Blow the smoke through your nose total game changer ) I have found a new day time smoke!”"
samuraii05,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/clementine-kush/reviews/1463694,"“Love this strain . Perfect hybrid, the relaxed of the indica and the trippiness of the sativa make it a fun high for sure .  I usually can blaze about 3 joints of decent herb and function fine ; I smoked half a j of this shit and was stuck , hahah.  An enjoyable stuck, of course ... :)”"
