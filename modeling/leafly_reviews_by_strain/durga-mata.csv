agreenpassion,https://www.leafly.com/indica/durga-mata/reviews/1410011,"“nice tight dense with a lot of mostly cloudy trichs. high comes on fast and powerful. with a mentholy mint taste on the inhale and a turpentine-jet fuel taste/smell on the exhale leaves a menthol taste on ur tongue. very interesting terpene profile. 
body pain seems to disappear and painful tingly nerve pain is forgotten. happy and talkative but a bit slow and sleepy. fun for gamers.”"

bradesc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/durga-mata/reviews/1663032,"“Durga Mata is a new indica strain for me and honestly its it’s up there with some of my favorite indica strains. The buds were tightly compact and filled with crystals. Tough to put a finger on the flavor other than maybe earthy and extremely potent. Be sure to have a glass of water ready as the cotton mouth is definitely a factor. Smokes well and has a good balanced body high. Enjoy!”"

VonHammersmark,https://www.leafly.com/indica/durga-mata/reviews/1736989,"“I really wanted to like this. I am the type who looks for a cooling body stone. I suffer from chronic nerve pain due to a herniated disc disorder. I was really looking forward to a nice relaxing effect. But sadly it did not provide any relief for me. Just severe dry mouth. Marijuana has been my only source of pain relief for years as conventional meds make me sick. I will have to move on to something else.”"
