nicagreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheeseburger/reviews/1375566,"“It was okay :0 

It tastes like cheese and umami but I can't say it really tastes like a cheeseburger. The smoke was harsh. :( the high was mediocre and it's been some time since I've had cheeseburger but I can't say it really helped with my pain, nor did it help me fall asleep. :( 

Maybe it was poorly grown, stored or cured. :( it can really affect your plants. 

🍔 = 💩”"
DualMerlin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheeseburger/reviews/1340210,"“I agree with earlier comments; a mellow strain with no defining characteristic(s).  Whatever you bring into this session will continue, only more foggy.  I usually mixed it with another strain.  Overall, I was underwhelmed with this strain.”"

This sticky stuff had my whole body in lock down within a few minutes.  Just when you think bud can't get any stronger that 29.9% THC hits you again.  My new favorite!”"

It's a slow drive drive down a familiar road for me...much like most other reviewers have said, this is not a bad strain, but it's not a great strain either. I wouldn't suggest this for a special occasion...It is really in the middle. Having spent three dedicated sessions with this strain, here is what I do and do not like about it (as both a medical patient and a recreational user.) Cons: Yeah, it ...”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheeseburger/reviews/1288208,"“I bought this one because of the name, obviously, and because I like indica dominant strains. This is a very average indica... no real head high, a nice relaxing body high, but nothing special.”"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheeseburger/reviews/1329844,"“Cheeseburger's effects are mellow, providing a nice body buzz and uplifting feeling. It does not taste like a cheeseburger, rather more like coffee. I like this strain but it did make me feel a bit anxious for a few minutes and I felt a bit burnt out once it started wearing off. Overall, it is a nice strain for relaxing. I would recommend trying it if you get an opportunity. 🍔”"
cbyoung2001,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheeseburger/reviews/1390298,"“This strain is obviously grown for its yield and not potency.  Though mine had some great Cheese terpenes, that's where the Big Mac stops.  Probably grown outdoors, don't look for any good indica pain relief from Cheeseburger.  It's a very mellow high with only small amounts, if any, of medical benefits.”"
