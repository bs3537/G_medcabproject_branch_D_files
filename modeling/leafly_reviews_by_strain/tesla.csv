Bmcornell,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tesla/reviews/1414894,"“This is by far my favorite.  I'm usually really sensitive to thc so I would keep it normally under  14%.  But after trying Tesla my pain and tension was immediately gone.  No high is needed because this is pure relief of anxiety.  It makes me so normal and if you know anything about anxiety feeling normal is amazing.”"

After then going to a pizza place he could no longer speak English and became very angry even when enjoying his pizza.”"

All I can say is that it's the most functional, daytime, get stuff done strain I've ever smoked. Not only that, its medical effects are incredible. Decreased anxiety while simultaneously increasing productivity and energy, helps with pain and inflammation -- all around winner.”"

It starts off giving me energy and making me motivated then relaxes me and melts away my pain. Never felt high just relaxed and less pain. My back spasms and this helps for that as well. Great medical strain.”"

I am retaking a Stats class that I failed miserably last year and just started smoking regularly this year.
