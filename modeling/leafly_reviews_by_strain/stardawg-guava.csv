BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/stardawg-guava/reviews/1410856,"“I got a few ounces of this stuff and holy hell! Let me just say it will stink up your whole house in a matter of seconds.  It was like the traditional Chem aroma with a whole new level of pungency added.  The buds themselves were tight, dense, and dusted in amber trichomes like someone had left them on a shelf and forgotten about them.  The buds also had these really dark spots almost black that I've seen with chem b...”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/stardawg-guava/reviews/1444025,"“Let me paint a picture of this strains potency.  I'm a concentrate smoker, maybe half gram daily. I can't even remember the last time I smoked flower. I went to the dispensary to get me some goodies, I have been wanting to try this strain, but haven't seen it around in concentrate form yet.  Anyways I get to the dispensary & almost got upset someone next to me wanted to buy everything they had, I turned on the charm ...”"

hazefordayz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/stardawg-guava/reviews/1411755,"“Jesus Christ! This bud is absolutely amazing, it's got the kick of Stardawg but with a tropical fruit aftertaste! Fuel/Chemical aroma with sweet fruity overtones and a really pungent generic smell, this strain will definitely stink your house out. The effects are just like Stardawg but with slight more emphasis on the body high, so if you are a fan of the Dawg, definitely pick up this strain!”"
g.kirk,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/stardawg-guava/reviews/1445601,"“One of my favorite sativas on the market. This strain has a pretty diesely smell to me but it vapes very smooth with a fuel after taste but not like SD. The high is incredibly functional and I was able to get to class & get through without any issues. Got this strain for $10 an 1/8th @ Fox Street in Denver as apart of my med benefits but it was well worth it as it is a great day time strain and was awesome for gameda...”"

trex4431,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/stardawg-guava/reviews/1410860,"“Lifts me way up at first and sets me down gently at focused. It is  soooooo potent you save green in your pipe and in your pocket because it doesn't take much to do the job well! I usually stick to sativas but I ventured out with this hybrid. I must say it did not disappoint.”"

Can't take it out of the bottle, The Smell: the top pops off to reveals a tar and pine smell very unique very different from everything I have ever smelled tar is very specific different than diesel, diesel has more a harsher tone.

Daniel916,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/stardawg-guava/reviews/1410859,"“This is a good strain for commercial growers looking for a high yield. I feel a head high, euphoria, and hunger. This strain would be good for something active like hiking as well as something like relaxing inside like watching Netflix. I can smell pine and fruit in the jar of buds. Trying this with a bong and hemp wick, I tasted chemical, tropical fruit, and a hint of diesel flavors. Overall, I would give this strai...”"
TickTockCroc,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/stardawg-guava/reviews/1435570,"“I'm not sure if this is the same strain, but I got a batch of "Guava Dawg" and let me tell you, WOW. I was completely surprised by the way this just blew me back from one bong hit. Instantly medicating, instantly throws you into the stars. I'd say it's a balance of sativa/indica, you can feel the energetic sativa effects, but way more on the indica side. It definitely turns into a deep body stone and gets you sleepy.”"

It was awesome, settled fantastically, relaxed me; also pain from my "Left toe Knucle" is reluctantly absent. My Jacuzzi is off now, just a swirling water massage cradle, and comfort while my lower chest and joints disapate pain. 420”"
Donny_420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/stardawg-guava/reviews/1721017,"“Despite being a sativa strain this shit made me really sleepy. It was a very pleasant high and it had a lovely flavour when I smoked it. When I exhaled it created massive amounts of smoke for some reason which made for some cool smoke tricks. The nugs had some dark spots on and were laced in trichombes. This strain stinks to high heaven so I don’t recommend it to anyone living in their mom’s basement.”"

Things are just funnier or I'm in such a better mood that I laugh a lot on this. Tried as flower and live resin. This is a great sativa that's closer to an indica with the giggles.”"

garneroutlaw,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/stardawg-guava/reviews/1705990,"“Strong as hell and a nice psychedelic touch to it the first 20 minutes. Pretty harsh on the lungs, buds not compact. Don't start up with full tokes with this one, it's harsh and very potent. It's pretty like the sativa dominant version of Master Kush. 

The high mellows out and sent my mind racing. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Either way a Diiv album saved my ass from the void. Eventually ended the...”"
