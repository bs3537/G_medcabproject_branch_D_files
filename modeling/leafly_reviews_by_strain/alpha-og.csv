smpad,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alpha-og/reviews/1643803,"“An easy peasy bud with an imagination for relaxation. On this the hyperventilating hosts of YouTube make sense, as they slow down but remain consistent. The world glows with opportunity. I love my life.”"
xblackrobx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alpha-og/reviews/1756193,"“think of OG Kush, but with an extra gear. nose is similar to GSC, good and doughy with a hint of pine and lemon. turned me into a space cadet with the meanest dry eyes ever, save this for when you ain't got shit to do for sure.”"
Kash0427,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alpha-og/reviews/1411773,"“ALPHA OG is AWESOME!!!
Nice smooth burn with light spicy flavour. 
Slow light buzz at first and then it hits quick with nice mellow high. 
Had a amazing sleep! 😴”"

ostra,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alpha-og/reviews/1194197,"“Delicious, potent, and an extremely heavy hitter — Alpha OG is not one to be messed with. I picked this up based on smell alone and was extremely satisfied. With a fresh, earthy taste, it feels like you're taking a breath of pine forest air and hits silky smooth. Boasting a fairly dynamic high, an excellent peak, and a euphoric come down, Alpha OG is a great strain to keep in rotation.”"

heydanielle21,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alpha-og/reviews/1725041,"“Perfect strain for those days where you find yourself coming home from work exhausted and worn out. Helps with mind racing thoughts and uplifts mood. Overall one of my favorites so far to smoke at the end of your day. It’s helps make the next day bearable.”"
rickyskip,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alpha-og/reviews/1365759,"“This strain is incredible, just won 1st place potency at the 2017 San Diego Farmers Market!

 unfortunately for me my sinus is jacked as I smoke it, but it did get rid of the headache”"
bluntreviews,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alpha-og/reviews/1128979,"“Beautifully structured nugs covered in trichomes with short red hairs scattered throughout these flowers. After two bong rips I'm feeling relaxed but able to stay focused on whatever I choose. This would be a strain that I'd smoke before bed forsure. Definitely potent. This nug has many different scents to it ranging from diesel to mint to that earthy og scent.”"

Chief-Wyattaye,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alpha-og/reviews/1225339,"“Got a pretty good body high from this strain, made me feel pretty stoney, helped with sleep but didn’t put me to sleep, slight munchies but controllable, was too relaxed to make it to the kitchen. If you’re an indica heavy hybrid fan Alpha is probably for you.”"
bird5534,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alpha-og/reviews/1155847,"“best og ever. alpha medic is my go to spot. so lucky to be in SD where they are. best collective around in my humble opinion”"
delg932m,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alpha-og/reviews/1218405,"“Phenomenal strain. Super dank, heavy on the indica side but not overwhelming. First time ever getting a hybrid as I'm usually an indica kind of smoker but this is phenomenal. Would I get it again? Eh, I'll pass. But I'm not dissapointed with it at all and am enjoying every last bowl.”"
