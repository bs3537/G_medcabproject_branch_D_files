Got a hold of this early in the day and it was very relaxing and tasted like potent earthy sweetness. My afternoon wasn't a couch-lock but i still enjoyed my heavy Indica high. (though i'm sure i could'a smoked more and been super ripped).”"
BreezeChap,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kelly-hill-gold/reviews/1261307,"“Never heard of this strain but picked it up based on smell and looks. Has a pleasant earthy/spicey smell, and nugs are super dense and sugary.  It was definitely potent but didnt ruin my sunday”"
iamannas1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kelly-hill-gold/reviews/1259303,"“This strain gives an awesome head high, with a small amount of a nice stoney body high. The terpene profile is great, a strong fruity smell with a saturated bright green bud, sprinkled with lots of amber pistils and sugary trichomes.”"
