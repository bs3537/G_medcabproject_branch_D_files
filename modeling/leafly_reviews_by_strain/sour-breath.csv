diestevo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-breath/reviews/1374652,"“great high. a few hits and your set. this stuff smells like swag and if not grown right breaks down just like it. the high is a head high that leaves you day dreaming and wondering the mysteries of the universe. the taste was very earthy with  an almost dirt after taste. small dense buds.”"
TiltingatWindmills,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-breath/reviews/1498347,"“The high was quick to set in and quick to leave ... Very heady high, you'll be thinking about everything and anything and might get a little motivation to clean house. I smoked a gram in a joint and that was more than enough to get me anxious as hell. I smoked .5g in a joint the next day and I still had some pretty overwhelming anxiety. I can deal with anxiety but this stuff can really kick it into overdrive.

I have...”"

knock me on my tush so I'm still able to get out there and take care of things. I tasted a slight desiel taste smoking it from my bong not very heavy on smell though.”"
Lunarsea,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-breath/reviews/1569436,"“I initially had an aversion to this strain due to the pungent odour. As someone who struggles with anxiety I tend to steer clear of strains with any diesel aroma as they tend to be too racy for me. After sharing a bowl with my boyfriend I felt energetic and focused. This strain made me crave physical activity and motion, like my heart might explode if I didn't start moving. This would be a great strain for outdoor ac...”"

buzzbomber,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-breath/reviews/1573221,"“Light green crumbly buds with clusters of dark red hair. Not real smelly but this taste is 2 green thumbs up! I keep this for personal. The sour notes make your mouth water and you want more and more. Effects are felt instantly. This is more like green crack then the real strain. You wanna crumb yourself to death, but you can't put it down. Ever toke sends you well above the clouds higher and higher and the anxiety i...”"
Exolight,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-breath/reviews/1413058,"“Relaxed, mellow high while still letting you focus and move around the house. Gives a decent head buzz, but even after smoking an entire bowl off my pipe I found myself wanting more from it. Being a Sativa, I had thought it would be much more intense that I found it to be. Overall, it was cheap and smoked as such.”"

Sean1982,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-breath/reviews/1706937,"“Light and fluffy buds, smells like sour candy and really sweet. The high is weird it’s like nothing at all until you’re almost done the joint and then without you even noticing the transition, you go from stone-cold sober to a clear but strong high. The psychological effects: uplifted, happy, euphoric, tactile, social. Not recommended if you’re trying to get to sleep.”"
