I see a lot of kush hybrids n what looks like it COULD possibly be a shore hybrid. I will post a photo of some true htown shore. I have grown this strain for years and it is one of my favorite daytime medicines.

hobbit12,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shoreline/reviews/1417564,"“From the Gulf Coast of Texas, this Indica dominant hybrid packs a hell of punch. A unique floral aroma combines with earthy-truity taste for an uplifting smoke that will keep you laughing and joking with you buddies for hours.”"
DontHateTheBest,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shoreline/reviews/1417567,"“This Galveston,Texas strain was grown by the beach very close to me. I have never smelt a bud so dank. It smelled up my whole upstairs when it was in my closest. Its so strong. I was already blown on 3 hits. It makes you think and opens your mind, kinda similar to a psychedelic. The taste has a nice spice to it. This strain was the best bud I've had.”"

geeunit2014,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shoreline/reviews/1122838,"“It's been 10 years since I smoked this stuff in Houston, but all I can remember is the smell. It would stink up an entire house, even being in baggies, hidden in a closet upstairs, un-smoked. I do remember it being extremely potent too, and causing lots of dryness. Good luck finding it these days, but it still holds a place in my heart as the dankest bud I've ever laid eyes on.”"
palasas,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shoreline/reviews/1225785,"“Felt a nice body buzz and the mind was a bit high. Shoreline greatly increases creativity and happiness, it's really good for having a laugh with a group of friends or even completing some tasks that require thinking. Shoreline has a strong, earthy smell with a light citrus aroma and it tastes the same. 5/5, would recommend.”"
