Deep Purple

hazey89,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-purple/reviews/1334413,"“Deep Purple is Purple Urkel x Querkel. Mostly indica-dominant. Buds were very purple and when squeezed smelled like grapes and lavender. The taste is very purply. If you've smoked other purple strains such as Purple Kush or The Purps you will recognize the creamy, purple taste immediately. The high was lethargic and lasted a few hours. Great night-time smoke or daytime smoke when you've got nothing to do.”"

xenograft_,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-purple/reviews/1415475,"“This is a simple indica with a wonderful aroma. The flower I had was grown by Vita Organics, and was surprisingly green. Light orange hairs spiraled up towards the heads of the amorphous nugs. Its smell was sweet and fruity, but I'm not necessarily sure about grapes - it might smell a bit like wine. The high is heavy; light and warm euphoria, sedation, thought delineation, giggles. It's pretty classic, probably excel...”"

Definitely makes me feel relaxed , time feels like time is going by very slow like no audio is catching up to the visual images. Overall the high is sincere and makes me feel more intellectual.”"
ajuk2k,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-purple/reviews/1415485,"“A true indica! This strain tastes amazing but definitely for just relaxation high. You start off on a good head high then this strain will knock you out if you're even remotely tired. But the taste alone makes for excellent boat times !”"

Dense yet bone dry with a stickiness to the fingers. Crumbled to what would be similar to kief.

Upon inhale it is smooth, the THC will expand...you will know when to exhale and get the long awaited pleasurable flavor

It brought me back to a bowl of hot and sour soup...that sweet n spicy flavor throw some earthiness in @ the end and BAM, that is nice.
