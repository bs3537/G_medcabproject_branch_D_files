Blue Widow
=============
JDinPHX,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-widow/reviews/1414024,"‚ÄúI have debilitating neuropathic pain in my hands and feet from an emergency medical drug called Levophed.  I am facing digital amputations as probable for my future.  

My experience with Blue Widow is that it is THE MOST EFFECTIVE PAIN KILLER for neuropathy ("false nerve pain") of any cannabis strain.  And it does not make me clumsy as do most Indicas.  This is my new favorite, hands down.‚Äù"

I was happily able to run my company, move my neck and shoulder and last through meetings.  I didn't experience dry mouth at all compared to other high end strains. Compact buds, very slow burning.  Had to re-light a couple times, but I liked that because I'm a slow smoker. Overall, best strain I've tried. Fruity, but still grounded and earthy. Perfect mix of energetic functio...‚Äù"

I assume this will depend on how often you use it though.  It will make you very hungry though, so keep a bottle of water or hard candy around to help with the food cravings.

Hellasailed18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-widow/reviews/1359377,"‚ÄúBlueberry Widow is a cross between Blueberry x White Widow. The bud has a dense green glossy look, covered in THC. A hint of dark blue inside and outside the bud. The smell is filled with sweet blueberry, and fills the whole room in seconds with its aroma. Helps for insomnia, and stress. Recommend bringing a friend if you want to experience a pain free lifestyle!‚Äù"
Oakwright,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-widow/reviews/1351994,"‚ÄúThis stuff helps me get shit done without freezing up with anxiety!

Blue Widow is by far my favorite strain I have ever tried. It can kick stress and anxiety quicker than anything, and with a very small amount. It doesn't get me baked to the point I don't care, it instead mellows me. This is very useful because I'm still fully functional. That allows me to beat anxiety and stress even better because then I can tackl...‚Äù"

It has the sweet/sour taste of the blueberry with the soaring high of the White Widow. It grew like an indica with fat but long pedal leaves and had excellent bud to leaf ratio.

You feel a strong kush like high (euphoria / uplift / body numb / energetic). a little goes a long way.

eb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-widow/reviews/1227112,"‚Äújust hit it now.  First Real puff.  nice uppy.  really uppy and this is golden Extract 60%.     10 being cbds.  i dont want to hit it again due to white widow is sooooo strong.  little body settling in to match sativa feel.
ok just hit again.  White widow is dom.‚Äù"

rockinrobin477,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-widow/reviews/1389645,"‚ÄúI smoke for medical reasons and am not an expert. I'm giving reviews based on my experience with each strain, coming from a beginner perspective. 

I have Multiple Sclerosis, fibromyalgia, under-active thyroid, and am B-12 deficient. I deal with bad chronic pain, constant fatigue, insomnia, headaches, numbness, vertigo, and muscle weakness and spasms. 

I'm not one of those people that enjoys the smell of weed, I act...‚Äù"

Borderwitch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-widow/reviews/1609521,"‚ÄúTried this for the first time and wasn't too impressed. I found the after taste if you want to call it put me right off. I gave me a little feel of relaxing state, but I have tried a few others that were better. Every time a took a drag I hated the taste after and I just didn't want to finish.‚Äù"
