The Void
=============
Natashu212,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-void/reviews/1410167,"“Without a doubt, a killer. Mine was grown hydroponically, not in dirt, so the experience is different, slightly. Its is a 60/40 hybrid favoring indica. Mixed with Querkle and Apollo 13 (correct me if I'm wrong, thx).

The bud itself, has almost a 'caramel' hue to it, dusted white. (7/10)

 Smells like a skunk fucked a skunk. (8.5/10)

High 5/5 Like I said super motivational, not so much energetic.
Taste & smell 5/5 YUM YUM can all my dabs taste like this? Sweet dank taste. The smell stinks up my room even though it's shatter.

I have tried s...”"
DavidsBammer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-void/reviews/1394373,"“I had a gurls name tattooed on me but when I smoked this strain it motivated to get the VOID stamp over her name! Now that is sum good Ssshhhhhiiiiiiittttt n she it!”"
Jrockk26,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-void/reviews/1275785,"“One of the Best strain around AZ right now def check it out way worth it”"
BlueMax,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-void/reviews/1398397,"“Top notch strain for PTSD patients.  Highly recommended.  Almost instantaneous pleasurable lift.  Smoke a whole bowl and you won't want to do anything but putter around the house and listen to music.  Great nighttime weed.  A few puffs right before winding down and I go right to sleep.  Able to relax, stretch and feel sedate, yet fully in control.   For some reason, my pug dog goes absolutely nuts when I take the lid...”"
CyrusAmir,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-void/reviews/1084738,"“A pretty nice sativa with a great TGA sub-cool makes for a wonderful uplift in the beginning, a perfect choice if you are feeling sad or angry. Grew it outdoor, had a nice sweet smell with a hint of piney cheese. Hands down one of the best strains, if you are a TGA lover you should defiantly purchase a pack. If you are a lover of hybrids... a definite leaner. Once dried it had a sweet earthy smell. The taste was grea...”"
zacchary,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-void/reviews/1497433,"“Looks: frosty with purple hints, small pop nugs. 

Effect: gave me the motivation to clean my patio and sort threw my closet at night. 

Also produced instant hunger for me, I mean I put my joint out so I could go get food.”"
cloudywithachanceofweedbowls,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-void/reviews/1554416,"“Exquisite! The description was on point, this is definitely a high motivation strain. I would suggest pair this with a sativa that gives you energy to stay productive and control that raw mental power. Smells great, tastes grape. Fantastic if you need to get things done.”"
hcazrellim,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-void/reviews/1256024,"“I gave this three stars on my last rating, but I've got to raise it one more star. I've had several great realizations during my last couple of highs including this one and I've throughly enjoyed the more clear but still heavy head high. Super relaxing at the same time, like most people tend to say.”"
nickrazza,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-void/reviews/1399101,"“Apollo 13 x Space Queen x Purple Urkle
Indica that delivers the slightest of a sativa head buzz, with an en-captivating soft buzz that runs from your eyes to shoulders, down the spine, hips to knees, and through your legs to your feet. 
Not intoxicating. Not overkill.
Just a nice comfy couch lock that relaxes the mind and delivers a proper medicinal high for the avid patient.

Weekly dabble of my own, The Void is a b...”"
hightideinphx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-void/reviews/1465703,"“This is exactly what I needed to lift my spirits on a rough mental health day! From the first whiff I knew I was going to love this strain - it's a strong smell that reminds me of a grape punch; very sweet and inviting. I micodosed with a few small hits of flower and it is energizing, uplifting, and put a smile on my face! Light, airy, fruity smoke!”"
monstapuss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-void/reviews/1618604,"“Ok... this is the “real” review!  What I had before must have been mislabeled.  This is an exceptional hybrid!  Made me very talkative (not able to hide the stoney speak & giggles), happy, pain, anxiety & nausea free!! 

This makes me cough my lungs out in flower, but it is a kinda stale pre-roll. Think it would be great in concentrate! 

Damn! 5 drags & I’m hit😂.... a creeper that lasts awhile! Lookin for this agai...”"

The staff is great, the place is nice, and their selection is outstanding. Stocking only the finest rec/med cannabis on the front range, coupled with a friendly staff makes for a great experience for both seasoned vets or nubes. Now... On to the smoke

The first impression for me was the purple. Undica all the way! Well, not all the way being that ...”"
