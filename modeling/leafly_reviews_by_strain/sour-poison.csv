It's a pretty green and orange flower.  Tastes sweet and earthy with diesel undertones.  Relaxation kicks in nicely after a cough or 2.  After 1/2 a blunt, I'm butting it out.  (:”"

This takes all the energy of Durban and combines it with that slightly psychedelic effect Sour Diesel can give to create what is probably the most tippy weed I've ever had. THIS STUFF IS STRONG.  Like... being hit with a literal brick s-house, know what I mean? Make sure your belt is tightened...”"

KRSBudz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-poison/reviews/1696291,"“Sour Poison has been added to the archive. Very pungent, potent & pleasing. No edginess like you would get from a pure sativa. Very mellow; yet uplifting.”"
