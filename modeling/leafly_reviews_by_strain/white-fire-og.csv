RobRobRob,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-fire-og/reviews/1415440,"‚ÄúI've been with cannabjs for 15 years; this is the best ever! I was so so so so so so happy and uplifted that I wanted to CREATE! It started off with an airy, ethereal, open, earthy philosophical consciousness. It unfolded into sky. I laughed, I created music, It imbibed enlightened thought and expansive euphoria of mind and a mellow "surfer-sage" outlook proceeding a heavenly euphoria felt throughout the body. My bod...‚Äù"

The absolute worst symptoms I've been had for over 10 years are depression & mind-numbing fatigue.  Fatigue so bad I couldn't get out of bed.  And depression resulting from being able to not think clearly, as though my mind was full of cobwebs.  And that worst part of depression:  not getting joy from things that used to give you joy.

NautiDreams,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-fire-og/reviews/1416433,"‚ÄúI believe I have found my daily medicine with this one. Leafly's description of the smell is on point. It is very pungent earthy and sweet smelling. The flower I grinded and smoked out of my bubbler was top shelf.

ChefBoyarGabe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-fire-og/reviews/1417066,"‚ÄúAbsolute fire. The high is incredible. If suffering from depression or anxiety this strain will relax both of those and make you forget you have either of those. Helps you focus on the bright side of life and just makes you all around happy. Highly recommended.‚Äù"
Sapphyy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-fire-og/reviews/1418958,"‚ÄúVery potent strain. Packed and smoked about 3 good size bowls (9-12 hits) and was knocked on my ass. Very pain relieving but also very very very heady. After about 5 minutes you feel an intense head high followed by a nice relaxing body high. I would consider this one of my new favorite Indica Hybrids. Very good strain for winding down at night and just relaxing. I would say it's best for Stress Relief, Pain Relief, ...‚Äù"
ThatSticky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-fire-og/reviews/1392521,"‚ÄúI love it. my girlfriend took one hit and couldn't stop talking about how tingly her toes felt. "did you give me molly..?"‚Äù"
John18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-fire-og/reviews/1392525,"‚ÄúSome of the most beautiful buds I've seen...almost completely white crystals, with some unusually long orange hairs wrapping the dried flower.

I found the effect to be very pleasant, but it is strong, so newbies be warned.  I felt a rush after one good hit, and it is very smooth and tasty, almost sweet, upon exhale.

One of my Top 5 at this time.‚Äù"
nagchampa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-fire-og/reviews/1410047,"‚ÄúVery positive results for nausea & lack of appetite, as well as excellent for chronic pain reduction.

Suggested by the dispensary budtender, White Fire is now on my "go to" list.

A rarely come across a strain that I feel has equal sativa/indica effects, but this does seem to be 50%-50%.  I became hyper alert in a weird relaxed way and found myself going in and out of sharp focus to.....completely loosing focus.

I took a medium-heavy puff through my water-pipe and let me tell you this is a heavy hitter for a non-seasoned smoker. I clenched my shirt with one hand, and the exhale left me to shiver.
