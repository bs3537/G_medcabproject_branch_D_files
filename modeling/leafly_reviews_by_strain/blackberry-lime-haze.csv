With a spicy yet sweet aroma and distinctive (Barney) purple calyxes, this strain is as unique as it is phenomenal.  After vaporizing Blackberry Lime Haze, I wanted to conquer the world and had a positi...”"

Effects are subtler than White Fire OG or Blue Magoo, two of my other daytime regulars, but that can be a good thing. Mood lifting but not a soaring euphoria. Pleasantly energizing. Excellent pain relief for my osteoarthritis. Lower doses suitable for cognitive tasks. Higher doses yield a very enjoyable high that is great for light reading, TV, or social ac...”"

HerbChosen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-lime-haze/reviews/1356569,"“Super energetic therapy with initial berry note that finishes lime / haze --- very unique flavor. The nugs are thicker and denser than would be expected for such pronounced haze flaves and effects. A couple Iced up Vrips and it was back to work pain free and focused. Wish it was available in more locations than just Portland! Are seeds or cuts available anywhere?”"
SeaDub14,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-lime-haze/reviews/1353758,"“Excellent!  Live resin oil, vaped- sooo tasty.  There's a great lime flavor on the exhale.  Incredibly functional.  Love it.  Definite mood-lifter.”"

Jacksnap,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-lime-haze/reviews/1353753,"“From the first taste to the onset of the full effect I found this is one special strain! Love the limey citrus flavor, and the clear mind!”"
Smokedudepdx,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-lime-haze/reviews/1353756,"“Stopped by Divine Kind and picked some up.  Tastes just as good as it smells!  Smooth to smoke and a smooth up.  It made me happy and playful.  I would for sure recommend this to everyone, especially sativa lovers!”"

vapordoc,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-lime-haze/reviews/1353754,"“What else can I say but WOW!! This strain quickly put me in a happy, social, upbeat and positive mood. All of this really helped take my mind off my lower back pain. I enjoyed hanging out with my friends and going out to bars downtown  : ) I'm really glad there is a dispensary that has this in my area. I am definitely going back for more!”"
mygreenbic,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-lime-haze/reviews/1356567,"“My favorite strain,  it doesn't give me anxiety..  It helps my chronic spine pain,  and it still allows me to think.  Only downside is it is very expensive where I procure it.”"
cmphox,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-lime-haze/reviews/1356566,"“Buds were covered in crystals, great aroma, citrus like along with floral and even earthy notes, which I usually associate more with a dark and fibrous indica.  The taste was not like the smell, although you do get a lime note as the hit finishes via vaporizer, which is really pleasant.    The high was long lasting, you'll think it's gone, and then be reminded that it is still poking around at least 2 hours in, and w...”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-lime-haze/reviews/1356568,"“This a great daytime strain. Vibrant green, covered in crystals and smells like some kind of lime-berry soda, really unique. Not super strong but puts you in a good mood and leaves you motivated. 4.5/5.”"
