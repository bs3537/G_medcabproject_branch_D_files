=============
Drunvalo420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rollex-og-kush/reviews/1396881,"“A Thought provoking head high takes over during the first 10-20 minutes until it slowly leads you in to a state of blissfully gigglyness and relaxation. A good indica strain to pass around friends.”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rollex-og-kush/reviews/1211675,"“Quite strong sensations from the Rollex. Very mellowing body effects that later turn into  ultimate couch lock. If you want to get any thing done you had better do it very soon after you smoke. Although the body is lazy and painless your mind on the other hand will be working overtime on all kinds of crazy schemes and ideas. Very hard hitting and long lasting.”"

Luckshott,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rollex-og-kush/reviews/1341664,"“Best Indica I've ever smoked. Starts with a fun, short, sativa-y head high, but quickly moves into total couch lock.  Great for sitting around a coffeeshop.”"

elibaker97,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rollex-og-kush/reviews/1363590,"“One of the heaviest indicas i have ever smoked! Strong og flavor on the exhale, and very effective in relieving pain and anxiety. The high lasts about 3 hours :) would definately recommend to other patients!!”"
MaximusTrichodermus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rollex-og-kush/reviews/1373924,"“This Heavy hitting indica from Devils harvest is one of my favourite genetics bred by them. Has a nice strong pine and diesel aroma followed with a hint of sweetness in it, full of earthy/pine terps with a hint of this real unique dank diesel flavour that just tops it off. definitely going to feel like staying somewhere and not having any plans after taking a hit of this.”"

With Rollex OG, I smoked half the amount I usually do and it hit harder than anything I’ve ever taken, and this effect is with every smoking method. It’s a very euphoric feeli...”"
