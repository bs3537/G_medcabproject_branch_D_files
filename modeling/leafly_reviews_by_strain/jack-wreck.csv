Strangely the opposite effect from Jacks. There is the trademark bright clarity, but eyes feel so sleepy (I’ve been up for 4 hours and haven’t smoked, so don’t think it’s other reasons). The Trainwreck produces a strong, dreamy experience - but the clarity from jack keeps you present and stable. Music is fabulous...”"

You ever have a day where you are just annoyed at the world or everyone is finding your last nerve and stomping on that bastard? All the while you know you don’t want to be in that mood but you can’t shake off the funk?

Well, let me introduce you to Jack Wreck....he fixes that shit.....and fixes it quickly.

I have now smoked this while happy (best high),...”"

Some people may not be able to handle this strain due to feeling "unstable." Otherwise, this strain is wonderful with a rush of energy and an intense euphoric high. One of my favorites.”"
TexasBeerMan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-wreck/reviews/1157500,"“Just got a batch of Jack Wreck,  and I was suprised at first then let down.  As soon as I hit it I got super high this is some potent stuff boy howdy.   But the high seemed to burn out pretty quickly.  I am the kind of smoker who likes to smoke once and enjoy the high for a while before I gotta smoke again.  I am definitely not a chain smoker and this strain just wasn't for me.  But to its credit I did get super high...”"
Stellan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-wreck/reviews/1387255,"“Definitely one of my top strains, considering its two of my favorites combined. Gives a great euphoria, and a intense mind high depending on how much you smoke. This strain will definitely keep you awake, my mind felt awake when my body was tired. I would recommend this for daytime. After a couple bowls of "Jack Wreck", I then took about three snaps of blue dream, this was definitely a great high. Combining Jack Here...”"

I find that the Jack crosses are very much hit or miss. The Jack Wreck from Organna Cann falls into the former category. Its a HOME RUN! Flavor, cure and smokability are excellent. The Trainwreck adds an incredible body tingle not usually found in other Jack Strains.Note: If you suffer from anxiety or mania, you might want to skip...”"

So, my tolerance is much higher than the casual stoner. I treat my conditions with a dab or two and then maintain with my favorite go to flower provided by my grower. 

Anyways, Jack Wreck is awesome. Timewreck and jack the ripper both are great evening strains for me, and their bastard child, Jack W...”"

Ice8842,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-wreck/reviews/1178657,"“Jack Wreck is a cross between Jack Herer and Trainwreck. Had a sour yet sweet smell to it and the high lasted a very long time. Mainly used for pain relief but can also be used for insomnia. Great taste and burns a long time.”"
cashew13,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-wreck/reviews/1379076,"“great sativa stain for mid day.really high thc (26% for the g I picked up)so it takes away the muscle aches but it still gives you a pretty intense jolt of energy so you can keep going. I can see thc sensitive users getting some anxiety from this one so you should probably only try this one if you been smoking for awhile”"
redbob,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-wreck/reviews/1279592,"“Quick onset high that last for a while. Felt really creative with an energy pickup to keep you focused. Highly recommend!”"
brewfus,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-wreck/reviews/1352317,"“I created an account just to make this review. I am a 3-5 times a day smoker mainly for appetite. I rarely get really "stoned". This reminded me of some of the first few times I smoked, it is seriously the most intense strain I have had. Vibrant and energetic,  with lots of mental stimulation. Beautiful stuff.”"
itsflipper,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-wreck/reviews/1166570,"“This shit is some flehm. It's hella cheap also. It's quick high and its not that smooth of a burn. But it's $7 a gram at my dispensary and it works perfectly in blunts.”"
johnrpd,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-wreck/reviews/1622095,"“Definitely a sativa with its mental boost.”"

hrumachis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-wreck/reviews/1199417,"“First encounter with JW. Very quick high that lasts. A sweet piney smell with some skunkiness. This high is creative and thought filled. A great strain to employ before reading or any artistic pursuit.”"

kemdawg91,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-wreck/reviews/1430708,"“Definitely a great sativa, but as I had read these reviews before trying it, I expected a little more energy and creativity from it. Still good stuff, though! Certainly made me feel quite content but also very sleepy after a few hours. Looks like other people may not have experienced that side effect, though, so I would definitely recommend giving this one a try if you're looking for a sativa!”"
thecrazypriest,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-wreck/reviews/1608347,"“Amazing medication, love the subtle stomach hunger without breaking the fridge. Potent mind and body mix that takes away pain and pursues the minds  eye. I feel this strain was meant for the creative after a hard days work.”"
