Northern Lights

ImaFlyboy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights/reviews/1417755,"‚ÄúI am a 60 year old male who has had two back surgeries and have a myopathy called Pompe disease. I am about at the end of my time here on earth as this disease progresses and the best medicine I have found to relieve the pain has come from this plant. I was on the "normal" protocol of opiates from my doctor for years and then I tried this strain. Daily usage has allowed me to greatly reduce the dosage of the Morphine...‚Äù"

We sat in my car, in a parking lot for 4 hours straight unable to move, and staring at the stars, after that time we drove (with great difficulty) to a restruant where we stared at our food for 2 hours before we came down. We have...‚Äù"
TwinkieLord,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights/reviews/1418004,"‚ÄúHands down best weed I've smoked. This tree really releases all of your blocks. On your mind and your body. Your thoughts just flow to you effortlessly. And the relief of my back pain almost made tears of joy come up. I couldn't feel any pain whatsoever(chronic back pain from injury). Doesn't feel like an indica at all. I'm a sativa guy. I need more of this in my life.‚Äù"
Tryingtotravel90,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights/reviews/1417192,"‚Äú...I am laughing on the inside and outside, because I see why people say this is the ultimate in Marijuana. (and everything is honestly funny to me right now)

I. AM. IN. LOVE. 

I have been smoking for awhile now, and all pretty great strains that are well known and universally enjoyed, but I have NEVER had a strain this complex in terms of effects.

It's an indica people, definitely NOT for daytime use (unless you want to sleep during the day). Wasn't sure it was going to live up to the hype, but me likey. Whoever grew this crop did it right.

kyleGHAD,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights/reviews/1417017,"‚ÄúFinally got to try this well-renowned strain, beautifully extracted into shatter. Upon first dab, I was feeling great! For the first ~20 minutes, was relaxing, calming, slowly vaporizing me just as the banger did the shatter. I didn't realize it, I thought my insomnia was going to continue, my poor day the same, and late-night anxiety on red alert. WRONG!

BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights/reviews/1413896,"‚ÄúI got a batch of Northern Lights wax from Native Roots and thought it really deserved a review. 

The taste was that of sweet smooth earth. If that makes sense, its super nice actually not overwhelming but just right.  As for effects the vibrating body buzz from this stuff was real.

The effects of the high, wonderful! Everything is lightweight and very floaty. Completely don't give a fuck about anything. Great for anxiety and depression. Just FYI this is a VERY strong psychedelic strain. Not for the first time user, hits hard and keeps on a comin' like a freight train.‚Äù"

A lot of heady high - but in the odd sense you FEEL it in your head, but it actually remains quite clear-minded. You feel legitimately happy. Physically, you're relaxed and at ease wherever.

From the look of the crystal covered buds, to the flavorful, unmistakable light, fruity flavor a well done Northern Lights is the pinnacle of what I would call, "An old-timers top of the line smoke."

I live with Bipolar Disorder, High Anxiety and PTSD. Most strains I smoke can sometimes leave me being anxious and my head spinning. The high you get from this is perfect for anyone with extreme anxiety IMO. It leaves you with an intense body high and a very chilled out, happy mood. Very helpful with sleep as well.

John18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights/reviews/1509719,"‚ÄúA great Classic Strain, simply put. I be telling the truth, y'all. A well done crop of Northern Lights should register somewhere in the 22-26% THC zone, and that's plenty strong, for the psychoactive properties of this wondrous flower make it a mind bending experience when smoked.

kpippin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights/reviews/1383824,"‚ÄúAs a grower, Northern Lights overall I would not recommended cultivating.

max.r.mcmeekin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights/reviews/1145867,"‚ÄúThis is a great overall strain. The flavor is almost hashy in taste, and the bud itself smells amazing.
