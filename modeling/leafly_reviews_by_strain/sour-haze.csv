Sour Haze
=============
Celathian,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1397490,"“I was told this was a good strain to smoke before going to the gym, and I have to agree.  I had he best ever shoulder workout after smoking this.  In between sets I would watch TV and would giggle at sports stars and America's Funniest Home Videos.  I was really easily able to target my deltoids, and especially rear delts, which can be hard for me to do usually.”"
philosophin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1397492,"“This shit's amazing...it rivals Alaskan Thunderfuck in awesomeness and potency, minus the exhaustion that sets in after a serious ATF sesh.  The smell of the smoke is STRONG and, to my nose, kinda like a cat / skunk piss combo, so I would suggest vaping if you are paranoid about smells traveling.”"

hunter9231,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1397494,"“• With two sativa power parents, it's certainly not unforeseen they produced a 💣child prodigy! 
..tho I AM surprised so many have described the high as relaxing. (I'd def say it's more adderral than xanax! 😉) The very-pungent, harsh flavor +smoke may turnoff some newbies but🔥euphoric-reward surely makes up for it! ✌🏽•”"
philosophin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1398663,"“Fucking amazing.  VERY potent, and relatively clear-headed and alert high.  I'm in love.  The smoke reeks of cat/skunk piss though, so I would suggest vaping if you're paranoid about smells traveling.”"
MsCannaGeek,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1361337,"“I suffer from acute and chronic pain : past history of GI cancer , Sugical intervention , spinal stenosis, and PTSD , GAD and anorexia nervosa (no fancy acronym for that) for these I medicate for. 
Currently my doctors are unable to control the nerves (including pain) in my lower back, which is really painful. And I've been seriously depressed.  I had a small dab of Sour Haze and my depression was gone ! Dab #2 (and ...”"
flipndip187,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1397495,"“I was very excited to come across this. Ive had Super Sour Diesel and Super Silver Sour Haze. This may have been better. The buds wreeked of sour amonia and kerosene, and looked dark due to the amber trichs covering the thick purple and forest green nodes. The first hit floored me, it was the strongest diesel flavor i had ever tasted. Piney diesel with a slight sour kerosene twist. The effects also floored me, Shooti...”"
Momma_Bear,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1397491,"“Bought a gram of wax -- and I must say, it's the most uplifting high I've ever gotten. Easy to stay on task and just have an overall happy experience. I'll definitely be buying this strain again!”"
PlasmaWaffle,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1398661,"“Excellent sativa. Gets me ripped from 2 tokes on a joint and almost no other strain does that. Tastes nice and smooth too!”"
Infinite7,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1427204,"“This strain is amazing I gig the Sour D crossed with a Haze that says its unknown but this is energetic, has a long saliva buzz with no anxiety, pain, and anxiety melt away like left out butter while this strain is loved by women for cramps, and if they are unhappy one would love to get them feeling better S they should come first, unless you have a child and you better know and understand children need their mother ...”"

Super stony but easy going high, the taste is amazing, even the flowers themselves are beautiful!  If you come across this strain do yourself a favor and try some, it's so worth it!”"
warzone13,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1385977,"“To me, this strain smells slightly minty... It grinds up nicely and provides a strong yet fairly levelheaded high, so it's ideal for daytime smoking when you're planning on getting shit done.”"

Rojachick,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1620115,"“I can feel the part diesel/part haze. Very relaxing but not sedating for regular smokers. Lessens muscle pain, anxiety. Causes hefty dry mouth.”"

LilHazyJ,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1632109,"“Ok, where do I even start...
Like most of the other sativa strains, this one gives you a really, really dry mouth. When I first hit the blunt, I got lowkey dizzy and my head felt a little bit heavier. But after 2-3 min. my surrounding started to feel mich clearer. All the colors started to feel more intense, a very nice feeling. Would definitely recommened this for outdoor.”"

This is a great strain for day time use, particularly before exercising or locking yourself down with a project.  Super motivating and full of focus, even with the heavy head high you get, you're still getting shit done.  

In closing, this is what a Sativa should be all abo...”"
aeoneos,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1281983,"“Not sure if it was because of the quality I got from the dispensary or if it wasn't my thing but the strain was average. I love a good head high which I expected but it wasn't near that. Felt great overall but just didn't live up to the expectations I've heard about the strain. I'd give it another chance though being I'm not sure if it was the strain or my resources.”"
willsbird,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-haze/reviews/1129416,"“At a cheap price I believe this is one of the better if not the best herb that you can get. It gave me a very positive and uplifting high. I took off one star only because it left me with some dry mouth.”"

SHZ is a sativa strain and is not 'usually' going to give you the "head" high. A lot of reviews here mention they wanted a more heady high. If that's the case, you're going to want to go go for an Indica dominant hybrid or a straight up Indica. personally, I like using this gor work at the computer. I do web design and marketing and this gets my creative...”"
