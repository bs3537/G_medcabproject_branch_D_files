Star Killer OG tested at 28% THC, and you can tell by the first tasty puff. It smells like OG Kush and tastes like Bubba. The high is intense and initially it was all cerebral then it began to creep all over and that's when a comfy couch became my place of pure satisfaction. Great flower really strong so novice weed heads beware and patients suffering f...”"

My wife has some serious back pain and the pain just slipped away.  Sex is great with it!”"

High THC indica's seem to be most effective for PTSD. I also enjoyed Scott's OG. Another helpful tip in treating PTSD with cannabis: avoid Sativa's that may promote anxiety.

The high Indica mixture must be best for me because I have not had to deal with panic with Star Killer. In fact, much the opposite.It helps with pain and takes away the too active nerves si I can finally get to sleep. The lady at Farma in Portland said it feels like settling down with a cup o...”"

MrJackpots,https://www.leafly.com/indica/star-killer/reviews/1438139,"“Full-bodied hit. Tasty, but strange. Faint grape. Hints of pine and lemon. Some soil. Very low-key flavor.

Effects are pleasant. Calming. Chills you right out. Reduces stress and soothes the troubled mind. Seems determined to make you sleepy or hungry as well.

Not recommended for constant use, but great as a first or last smoke of the day.”"
