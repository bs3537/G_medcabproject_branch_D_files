Doesn't work too well for taking pain away but it will lift your mood and make you feel euphoric. Similar effects to that if PineApple Express but the taste is much more earthy. I had this one with THC levels of 26% and kept me high for at least 4 hours.”"

I vaped flower- cheese again on inhale and mustiness and strong earth on exhale. Hits fairly quickly but takes about an hour to level off. My head felt pressurized but not in a bad way. I suffer from bad headaches because of pinched nerves, scoliosis, and herniated discs and while this didn't do a ton for straight pain, it help...”"

You were so good last night, a beautiful combination of body relaxation and nice, consistent mind stimulation makes you perfect to enjoy any time of day. Your earthy buttery smell and outstanding orange hairs could make even the worst cotton mouth drool.

9/10 Would recommend to a bud.”"

I like their spoetnik #1 alot better than this: belladonna just didn't do it medicinally for me. The high was pretty trippy, but really not the most pleasurable effects. It brings with it a kind of prime evil bio sludge feel to the high and it does somewhat effect visual observations but its really a creepy type of high in my opinion and not very sativa leaning at all. I'd say the e...”"

For me it has more indica effects, not sativa as mentioned. Really strong body high, heavy couchlock effect. Overall great strain!”"
