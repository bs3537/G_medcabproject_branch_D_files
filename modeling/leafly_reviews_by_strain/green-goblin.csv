I would strongly recommend this medication to anyone suffering from arthritis pains. To my surprise tho, no paranoia at all and I feel quite "euphoric"...”"
Nirvana,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-goblin/reviews/1358608,"“Buds: Very pungent smell almost like a strong diesel. The buds in general were fairly decent size with lots of trichs and very sticky. They were a bit fluffy but for the most part there are practically no stems. 

Smoke/Quality: We rolled a joint of about .75 just to get a test of it. The first few hits had almost a sweet kind of taste. The joint burned evenly and extremely smooth. A very tasty strain to try. Every...”"

After 4 bowls I was high off my ass and could barely walk. I became paranoid and lost all track of time. Time seemed to slow down. Eyes got extremely dry. When walking in the dark outside in the breeze I felt like I was flying.”"

I have been smoking regularly (at least 3 bowls per day) for 6 years now and out of all the different types of chronic I've tried I would put green goblin in the top 3. I am enjoying some as we speak! It takes a special kind of bud to really get me high now, but this does the trick! I have been getting very high all day and I love it! :)”"

The strain really leaves you feeling super euphoric and happy and content just listening to music for hours, leaves you with a amazing feeling and the come down is nice and relaxed, without a doubt one of my new favourites”"
Friedannie,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-goblin/reviews/1354179,"“I like it because it's not as heavy as other sativa I have tried. I'm just right at the start of the high now, I should probably wait to review but I know I'll forget 😝”"

I cut a tiny nug in half and tossed it in my bong and dropped some cubes in.  Took two dry hits.  Surprisingly i had enough left to take one and a half more bong hits.

The structure held up very well and the production was very good.

Three and a half hits out of such a small amount was ...”"

Got a true Green Goblin strain it made me feel highly euphoric and relaxed, where as Green Crack gets me GOING literally. If you see this strain definitely check it out, very Lime green buds with a high Diesel smell to it. The taste is amazing. 5 stars all the way!!!!”"

It doesn't weigh me down and I can still function normally -- more or less. But, also a very giggly happy strain. Doesn't do much for insomnia though.”"
