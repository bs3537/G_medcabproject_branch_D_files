El Nio
=============
xRaBBiTx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/el-nino/reviews/1316087,"“El Nino is one of the higher grade strains that is more of a yellow color than that standard light green. Super smooth taste.”"
MadCrazo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/el-nino/reviews/1339109,"“Very dense buds, immediately after I take a puff I feel a lazy sort of sensation creeping around my eyes. Very relaxing strain! Its a hard body high with a clear headed cerebral effect. Would recommend for an evening toke!”"

PainfullyIntro,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/el-nino/reviews/1063151,"“Very similar to any normal mango scent, but what really differentiates this strain is how potent and scratchy the smoke is compared to the sweet and easy to taste of regular mango kush. As an everyday smoker i was excited to taste such a difference when the smell of the bud was so sweet. The high was much longer and i slept like a baby even after the 3rd gram smoking it.”"

govermint,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/el-nino/reviews/1063145,"“Has a really sweet and smooth taste thats all i can get from it, no real taste of anything, actually tasting it more it has a marsh mellow kinda taste if you take a huge hit and it has no real smell.”"

Eezeebuds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/el-nino/reviews/1718053,"“Taste ~ 10/10 super sweet and earthy
El Niño gave us a really happy mix of a head/body high, pretty relaxed, pretty giggly. Also got some munchies. Good strain to keep doing activities or throughout the day.”"

108,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/el-nino/reviews/1063149,"“This is the first and only strain out of many that I've tried that actually helps me fall asleep. It isn't the strongest when it comes to a "high," but if you have issues falling asleep and the more popular Grandaddy Purple or Lemon OG aren't doing it for you, then El Niño is definitely worth looking into. Not a favorite strain, but a useful one.

Has an earthy smell with hints of mango. Taste-wise, it's a bit spicy....”"
