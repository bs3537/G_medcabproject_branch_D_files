I was severely depressed for several months, then I started taking Jack every morning and my world view changed completely.

It's 55% sativa, 45% indica. My best guess is it's commonly called a sativa because it has copious amounts of THCV and limonene which are more common with energizing sativa strains than indicas.

It's a very chill strain that has a balanced high. Tried it at night but probably a great day strain, as other reviews mention.
