Gelato
=============
kayelle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1417514,"‚ÄúGelato is amazing.  A good solid floating peaceful feel.  It's a heavy hitter and I was lifted after just one bowl... It allowed me to relax.. Still hold conversations and made everything feel so great. I took a shower about 20 min after I finish blowing and OMG the shower was amazing.. Then my husband and I had the most amazing lol time together.  This is definitely a favorite.  It will make you sleepy if you give i...‚Äù"
errzy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1417513,"‚ÄúI know it's an odd statement to make; but this strain made me feel good. But not in that way. It made me feel good...about myself. There should be another label for strain ratings "raises self-esteem" here. This would be my first vote.‚Äù"
TickTockCroc,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1415816,"‚ÄúThis has become one of my favourites. Doesn't instantly hit but 20 seconds later it suddenly packs a strong punch. Plenty of euphoria and uplifting creativity. I feel this is a nice all-rounder - you feel both relaxed and calm yet you still have energy to function. I can imagine this to be great for outdoor activities, cooking, or simply just looking to get your mind off things.‚Äù"

Hard to find in Southern Cali, know a place in the valley that gets bud from the bay. Incredibly dense and super frosty, with lots of dark purple. Smells and tastes like the sweet dessert it's named from. This cross is a great heady cerebral and euphoric high with some body for relaxing. Amazing unique strain fro...‚Äù"
Steamer2k14,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1414291,"‚ÄúI picked up some gelato #45 while I was in sf and was surprised by everything about it.

xblackrobx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1410983,"‚ÄúAbsolutely incredible head high, body buzz and unexpected pain relief to boot. Not the "perfect" strain (I def wouldn't want to go for a walk, etc) but for a lazy Saturday (or Tuesday evening...) around the house with no set plans it'll do just fine.‚Äù"
mouse777,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1414319,"‚ÄúCan I give it 6 stars??? Relaxing body high, lowers anxiety & improves mood a lot in my case. Very good for pain. excellent for projects, snuggling, rainy day, frazzled nerves, etc. Remarkably smooth to smoke, not harsh at all. Mind goes off on pleasant & productive creative tangents and you can still focus. It's powerful and comes on slowly at first. First time users of Gelato, try one or max two hits at first and w...‚Äù"
Totsy2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1413742,"‚ÄúAbsolutely fantastic high. No foggy headed feeling and you actually feel like doing chores. mood improves 100% with no anxiety. This strain really helps me with my anxiety and depression. I'm not so angry all of the time and I tend to be nicer to the people I love. Bottom line, if you have depression, anxiety and/or quick to anger, I HIGHLY recommend this strain, it has made my life so much easier which makes my fami...‚Äù"

It does not send waves of relaxation pulsating through your body like an indica, but it comes close. It does not send you into mental hyper productivity like a sativa, but it comes close. It is 75% of each full experience, but beware: this means you are getting 150% of a high. It is great stuff, and quite trippy. I do not recommend taking this if you are socially anxious a...‚Äù"

HairKnife,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1398394,"‚ÄúIf I had this 20 years ago, I probably would have LOST MY MIND. Now as an MS patient, I can really appreciate this proverbial godsend strain.  

Outstanding for anxiety halting mind-racing.  Zero paranoia. Pure Focus.  Should be called NZT-48, but the aroma/taste may not appeal to you; 9/10 would bang again.  I would call it Sour Gelato.  I'd like to see a GelatoXGumbo indica monster.  Somebody make this.‚Äù"
devanbanks,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1410102,"‚ÄúThis strain continues to stay in my top 3!!! I start on this strain in the early evening and on through dinner and bed.

Blackhawks15,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1330740,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried Gelato exactly one time, but it would be a sad day if I couldn‚Äôt find this strain again.  This is by far the best hybrid I‚Äôve ever had.  I don‚Äôt know if this is a trait of high quality weed, but the Gelato I smoked burned slow and it was so smooth that it really didn‚Äôt feel like I was smoking at all.  Right out of the bag, this smells like pineapple with a side of Boston cr√®me donuts.  It tastes like carme...‚Äù"
JediForce,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1331022,"‚ÄúI purchased some gelato #25 grown by the Authentic Cookie Company and I was so stinking high  after a single bong rip!   The flavor and aroma are out of this world.   The bud was so stinky my smell proof duffle bag was no match!  I HIGHLY recommend!  üëçüëç

chapominguezz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1339324,"‚ÄúThis strain is awesome!! punget and a bit of a heavy hitter but the high is great. Uplifting and Euphoric effects. And it smells great! Defiantly recommend to anyone‚Äù"
LilOne2490,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1338391,"‚ÄúI have been smoking on the heavy recently and this is the first flower that has me lifted and feeling light.

jfry420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1605015,"‚ÄúI payed a bit extra for this but upon opening was surprised by the smell. It was mind blowing how strong the odor of lemon and skunk.
I smoke daily and this strain had it all!
I smiled without trying and had a euphoria rush I haven't experienced for 20+ years

thevaporslounger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1761378,"‚ÄúReally great high, low burn temp for the dabber out there, but the taste was God awful. and I mean horrible it tastes like the burning sulfur pits of hell. but everything else, all of it, is 10/10‚Äù"
Donald420Trump,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1678426,"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see all the hype. It‚Äôs an OK hybrid leaning heavy on the indica side. It‚Äôs not that loud, had to smoke 2 joints to get right where normally I smoke one joint and I‚Äôm good. I smile 1gram joints of that tells you anything. It Taste like shit, like a rain forest. üåøüåø 2 our 5 trees. Could of been the cut i got, but I wouldn‚Äôt waste my loot on it again. Peace, 420TRUMP.‚Äù"

mam1173,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1381502,"‚ÄúThis just might be the perfect strain, I kid you not. The nugs are fairly dense and full of red pistils. The Thc content was a whopping 25%, but the high was mellow af. It makes you giggly, amorous, and all around happy. It's a strain that makes you feel good about yourself and the world. Can't recommend highly enough‚Äù"

LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1518134,"‚ÄúGelato is an exceptional strain, it totally mellows you out and just makes you feel great while still a heavy hitter.

strawberries,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1238673,"‚ÄúA lovely strain! It's a real crowd-pleaser and gives a very social high. I like it for when I'm hanging out and casually smoking with friends who don't smoke much. I wouldn't call it a connoisseur's high and if I want to have a solo sesh where I just really focus on the experience, this isn't the one I reach for, but it's definitely a very nice strain and one of my friends who doesn't smoke much asked me for the name...‚Äù"
