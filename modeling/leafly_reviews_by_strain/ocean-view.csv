After about 20 minutes or so, i felt the need to start cleaning my entire house while listening to long talk discussions on YouTube. Joe Rogan etc. It was a good sort of Energetic, Deep Thinking, Happy High. Not sketchy.”"
BowenIsland,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/ocean-view/reviews/1737811,"“Ocean View makes for a great day or morning strain.  This one from Tweed has a THC level of 11.9% which is lower than what this strain typically has reported to have in the past.  Having said that, it still packs a punch. The medium sized buds are light green and and completely covered by orange pistols.  The aroma of buds was predominately "Alfalfa" with hint of sweet berries.

Wasn't too harsh on the lungs didn't have any coughing while smoking. It tasted fine it didn't taste horrible or bad but it didn't taste phenomenal either.

Finigin5246,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/ocean-view/reviews/1767328,"“ever find a strain and you're just like "this is like everything I am when I'm not high but I get to be high while getting to stay just me" I got some really dry swag so it's pretty crispy on the lungs but the high is just fantastic. I can go to town on my comp and do everything I like to do sober without feeling inhibited or clumsying shit up and getting stuff done. A+.”"
CannabisCalvin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/ocean-view/reviews/1755801,"“Really nice strain. Amazing smell and taste, medium THC content makes it a good daytime buzzer. Very nice to look at as well, bright greens and orange. Definitely a strain worth trying”"
