Rose Bud
=============
IandI,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rose-bud/reviews/1376103,"‚ÄúBy Citizen Kane's burning sled, that's some good bud! Definitely has a potpourri of floral notes when smoked accompanied by initial spike of euphoric energy and creativity. Rosebud is no pansy, however. It knocks out pain and delivers a deep sleep, relaxed sleep. Does skunk up the place so be warned. Also, no munchies, which is a big plus for an Indica like this. Orson Well's would be proud.‚Äù"
IandI,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rose-bud/reviews/1347522,"‚ÄúBy Citizen Kane's flaming sled, that's some good bud! A crazy high Indica mix that taste like smoking a potpourri (pun intended) of flower petals with a whiff of light incense. Quite a bit of creative fireworks to boot via shot-lived,intense energy spike. Would not say this a super-social strain but packs quite punch to pain. Could also be good for a solitary meditation.‚Äù"

Makes my day easier and my pain level drops to a 3 when I function on a 9 everyday.  Love the smell and the buds. It's like having your own 12 dozen Roses. Lol! Taste is sweet,smell relaxing,uplifting, motivating. Since it's spring, kinda puts a twist on stop and smell the roses instead smoke this Rose Bud
 Happy Spring!!!‚Äù"
EverythingMedicalB,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rose-bud/reviews/1340531,"‚ÄúI gave this strain 4 stars because I barely rolled a .5 and still got a pretty good buzz. It's kind of heady and affects your mental; not tremendously though. One thing I did notice; that kind of (threw me off), was that the smell was really faint. This is the kind of strain you can smoke in public and nobody will really notice. Another thing; it was kind of crunchy like (mid). Don't underestimate it from its look an...‚Äù"
iitzMunchiiez,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rose-bud/reviews/1369230,"‚ÄúThis strain is an Indica, which I'm not a fan of. But it had an earthy and flowery taste. The smell wasn't as pungent as others. It was cured correctly and wasn't dry. All over, I'd give this strain 3 stars.‚Äù"
purplepalmtrees10,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rose-bud/reviews/1348813,"‚ÄúThis strain is really, very lovely. Smells like roses. Indica heavy hybrid. Strong body and head high, really nice. Comes on nice and smoothe. Has a nice taste as well. Would definitely revisit.üå∑‚Äù"

OffshoreNE,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rose-bud/reviews/1362528,"‚ÄúI'm generally a sativa guy but we gave this a try. The name couldn't be more accurate. Light smooth and floral smoke. Tastes exactly like the name suggests. Feels a little more like a sweet hybrid. Not blasted but good afternoon kind of medicine.‚Äù"
1kushking,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rose-bud/reviews/1491099,"‚ÄúRose Bud is a sweet little flower. The smell & lime green appearance with fine trichomes were most appealing. Don't let the lower THC level fool you. I got a nice long mellow high from it & at a 70/30 ratio you get a little bit of feel good for everything :)  Nice afternoon smoke. Worth the purchase from a trusted shop!‚Äù"
bgrist18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rose-bud/reviews/1451906,"‚ÄúSmells and tastes just like a glass of rose!  Fantastic flavor, beautiful buds with a chill high. Not too strong but it's not weak either.  Nice for a lazy afternoon or for dealing with the public (as it's not going to make you incoherent.)  All in all I would recommend trying it and I might try it again just for it's novelty.‚Äù"

Rad2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rose-bud/reviews/1577063,"‚ÄúSweet smooth relaxing , mellow but like a thorny rose it‚Äôs got some kick. I had a bad stomach ache just before I smoked the rosebud and it took my pain away instantly.
Melts anxiety and stress and is a laid back high.‚Äù"
