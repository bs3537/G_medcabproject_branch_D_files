The buds, which look medium-dense with nice, dried red pistils.
The smell is sweet and rich with spices.

I love the smell to it, it's so cheesy, I would for sure put this strain at the top of my list, good to smoke on the regular basis because of its cerebral effects, I stay focused.”"

It's a very unique aroma that actually tastes like you'd assume going off the smell. Sonja is a bad bitch who hits hard but doesn't floor you.  good strain for helping you maintain your focus.”"
MidwestsLoudest,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ultra-sonja/reviews/1264295,"“This Strain was pretty good for trying something different I haven't had before, the buds were nice dense crystallized popcorn nugs and had a interesting smell bouncing back between a cheesy diesel smell and sweet and fruity. Nice smoke for those who want to relax during the day”"

Had to smoke blunts of this back to back to keep a decent mello buzz going cause the high goes away quickly. $68 for a half bad buy in my opinion”"
