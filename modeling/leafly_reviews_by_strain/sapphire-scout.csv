The.Avid.Dabber,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sapphire-scout/reviews/1412097,"“Saphire Scout is one of the most exciting new strains I've come across recently. The deep green and blue hues of the bud make it hard to take your eyes off of, while the euphoric and relaxing effects rock you into a subtle calmness. The flavor is thick and hashy with sweet blueberry notes and just a tinge of diesely OG goodness. Can't wait to go get more!”"

1st impression. literally caked with crystal all over this shimmers. nice sweet smell to add to the great look.

smoking out of a bing and a cape both prove to be equally smooth almost to airy definitely not a deep smoke. but hit in a instant and leaves a slight giggle and he...”"

Firm medium green buds with a few light brown hairs & fine golden, yellow, & amber crystal trichomes. Smell & taste was a sweet berry. If you are lucky enough to see some, get some!”"
