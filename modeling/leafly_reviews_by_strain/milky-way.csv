SeaDub14,https://www.leafly.com/indica/milky-way/reviews/1359081,"“Calming, relaxing, but not inebriating... you can still function, but I'd stay close to the couch.  Tasty burn, sweet, candy-like.  Definite pain relief.  Great strain.”"
Trenttrx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/milky-way/reviews/1337988,"“Defiantly a creeper upper. Very smooth going down. Makes my eyes very dry. Time takes forever to pass. Body if def relaxed, and the smell is great. Super baked while writing this. 8/10”"

LongBeachHippies,https://www.leafly.com/indica/milky-way/reviews/1333144,"“Great Strain.

It's Menthol taste was great and had a sweet milk taste to it as well very calm feeling and energetic as well. The high is more of a calm mellow earthy and sweet taste good for relaxing and kicking back leaves you guess on what taste you will get next. Milky Way is by far the best strain for relaxing muscle pain sleepless nights and anxiety and also a earthy kinda of Pluto og taste. Well enjoy Hippies ...”"

wontonsoup,https://www.leafly.com/indica/milky-way/reviews/1586184,"“This bud is the bomb. It has an intense earthy/tropical taste, I’m honestly salivating at the smell of these lovely nugs. They have an unusual light brown/grey completion, and are absolutely covered in trichomes. Very euphoric, but I feel like I’m going to sleep like a rock tonight. Oath”"
Chimaera,https://www.leafly.com/indica/milky-way/reviews/1257839,"“Another winner, got some beautiful shatter and loaded it up in a Yocan Evolve Plus with ceramic coil. I get a very floral, tinge of mint, and cool eucalyptus flavor blast. There's a pleasant nasal vasodilation effect, it seems, as I can now breathe effortlessly through my nose. The high for me is an overall sense of relaxation but I've been indulging in other concentrate varieties tonight so further study is needed :...”"
