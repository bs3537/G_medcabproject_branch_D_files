After only a few hits this strong indica has your body buzzing and your mind racing. Very good for relaxing at home for a few hours before passing out. Great strain, great high.”"
Trixtereisenfield,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-berry/reviews/1750285,"“Great strain that clears your mind. It's sweet and sticky. As a person with anxiety, I found myself as chatty as my  Uber driver, despite my usual apprehensions when ride-hailing. A strain that doesn't mess with you, nor does it give you that fuddled, slurring side effect.”"
