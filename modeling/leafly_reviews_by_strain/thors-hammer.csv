Check it out Analytical 360 tested the Thors Hammer at 28.97 % THC on one test and CBD being below 1% at 0.3 % CBD

The strain used to be called Mjölnir but Snow changed the name to Thors Hammer because it was a pain in the ass to say. Those test are from 18% ...”"
blue0cean,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thors-hammer/reviews/1664125,"“As its name suggests, this is a real knock-out strain.  A noticeable cerebral high comes on relatively quickly (5-10 minutes).  Given its potency, use it discerningly.  Just the right amount can help with creativity and writer's block.  Too much could slam you out of this reality, leaving you dazed in a dreamlike state - perfect for tuning out to your favorite music, but perhaps not when trying to complete a complex ...”"

ftethers,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thors-hammer/reviews/1200873,"“This is an interesting strain. Not a strong smell till crushed, then a strong perfume scent that stands all on it's own like no other strain.

Lots of red hairs, and when grown well, should be very dense large copious buds. Covered in crystals and red hair, the buds can really be a piece of art just to look at.

The smoke and the high are pretty stellar, good luck to anyone who can find any north of LA. Usually g...”"

bluejen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thors-hammer/reviews/1658566,"“Really surprised everyone is saying this is an uplifted and good for blasting through work/errands. It knocks me out immediately. The name is spot on. One small hit and I'm woozy and starving. For me, it's the opposite of productivity. I'll smoke the rest of my purchase literally just to get rid of it but won't be buying it again.”"

I find it almost hard to sit still because I feel the need to be doing something. Great for being creative or going on a hike or other activities.”"

I am pretty sure that this is the vortex cross of Thor's Hammer l, reason being i've had that strain several times before and am familiar with its characteristics. anywho, TH is obviously powerful and full of energy and focus. Too much however can cause some slack in shifting gears. Wonderful for daytime. Very calm, considerate high but powerful all the same lik...”"
