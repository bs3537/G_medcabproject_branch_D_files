In fact, I decided to post this review only after I went back to the dispensary and stocked up on more of this wonderful strain. It has become my new favorite sativa, edging out Casey Jones, Jack Herer and Sour Diesel. First, let me tell you how skeptical I was about Moose&Lobsta: A 5-star rating with less than 10 reviews at the time of this writing? That didn’t se...”"
coachchronic89,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/moose-and-lobsta/reviews/1411004,"“weirdest name of all-time. with the obvious out of the way... the is MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE SATIVA. puts just enough "fuck it" in your system to take on shitty chores, your shitty job, etc. very enthusiastic and motivated and all the while completely clearheaded. very potent but a great daytime strain for heavy users. smells of citrus, pine, and fuel. buy it. burn it. love it.”"
ArsonMontoya,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/moose-and-lobsta/reviews/1389819,"“What an amazing strain. I was surprisingly introduced to this by a 68 year old patient one evening and must say the combination of the effects and the company made for a beautiful even if brief experience (atleast I mean the company.)

This strain left me ready to to take on any social task. I was focused, talkative and giddy.”"

I was at a friend's house for the super bowl and took two bong rips* which propelled me to a different space-time continuum. Very cerebral high with a bit of dizziness that lasted 3+ hours. Conversation was super hard to follow, but really interesting nonetheless if that makes any sense at all. I would say this is definitely a daytime/after...”"

Smoked out of a bong and had an immediate, intense head-high followed by complete pain relief from my shoulders to my toes. Got some pretty strong munchies but most of all felt relief from anxiety and found humor in just about everything. Would recommend a million times.”"
smokeylips1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/moose-and-lobsta/reviews/1378697,"“this Strain has taken #1 spot in my books. unfucking real - seriously lol.
It's one of the very few strains that flows in waves and is not a couch locker at all. 

first 5-10 mins are one of the most most creative thought highs ever - like have a pen and paper handy. then your ears begin to get warm and tingle and that warm tingle literally waves over your head about 10-15 mins in. then it's just smile and giggle cit...”"

The example I got is lime green and tangerine, on first glance, but on magnification shows peach shades.  The nugs are dense, sticky, and aromatic - the first smell left a heady jet fuel smell lodged in my sinuses, which gave way to diesel and an array of tropical fruits.  The first hit... ah, sweet magic!  Guava, kiwi, passion fruit, and...”"

I'd heard good things though, so I thought I'd give it a try. It was surprisingly smooth and a bit sweet. Good strain for depression, stress, and anxiety. Very uplifting and helps with focus when you have worries on the mind. Great daytime strain”"

Whole body experience.  Right now I feel completely high. I smoke heavily and have for a very long time.  After packing and clearing a bong 4 times I am laying on my bed feeling so fucking great I had to write a review.  Muscles I can't name feel high.

Very heavy head high yet still leaves you capable of having a full conversation without missing a beat. Nicely euphoric and awesome "Headband-like" haziness over your eyes.

The smoke is very clean.  Flushed very well.  The buds are the perfect match between dense and spongy.  When ground, the smell is of fresh Concord grapes. But when put in the rosin press this little lady comes to life.
