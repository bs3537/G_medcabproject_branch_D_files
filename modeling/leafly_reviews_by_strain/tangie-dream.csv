It's smells like the sweetest tangerine, but smoke earthy and smooth! 

I will definitely be grabbing more of this awesome strain!”"

surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-dream/reviews/1342833,"“I so enjoyed the fruity/sweet citrus twang! Both smell and taste alike are pure Tangie Dream. Dosed via Co2 vape... gave bursts of energetic exploration immediately and led me down it's path of intoxication. But it definitely has "a tendency to render one contemplating life".

Good pain reliever 
Mood enhancer 
5star taste and buzz
Memorable!”"

I am working on an incredibly uplifted high, well past an hour after smoking a Buddy Boy pre-roll, I got at Mr Bill's in Buckley. The heady is nice, not forgetful and confused, but inspired and alert with a dreamy haze.

The numbers show 30%, which is impressiv...”"

Its lineage (Blue Dream and Tangie) make a perfect blend of energy, focus and happiness to keep you motivated and productive all day. I tried the Kurvana Ascnd Tangie Dream and would highly recommend it to anyone but it may be best for a seasoned daily consumer. Get your hands on this strain. You won’t be disap...”"

I'd use it for a night strain but stimulates the appetite and going to bed hungry or full of munchies is never fun. All that being said, I suffer from PTSD and on the nights where the depression and insomnia consume me, I reach right for the Tangie Dream.”"

SirSparky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-dream/reviews/1590904,"“Smell is orange peel and sweet spring flower with the slightest hint of skunk. Taste is smooth hashy citrus with a sweet exhale. The high starts quickly and steadily builds into an intense but clear-headed hybrid experience. The head is spacey, euphoric and giddy:
The body pulls slightly but I’m not completely melted into my chair. I don’t notice any pain relief and it’s not exceptionally relaxing so the Sativa effec...”"

Really nice for just being around the house and getting things done, nice for traveling. Sometimes gives you the munchies too much so, but overall a nice de-stressed.”"
ilouieb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-dream/reviews/1753272,"“Tried Kurvana's ASCND Tangie Dream on my vape pen. Pretty potent, but wasn't a big fan of the effect. Effects can be tricky. Take too much and you can either find yourself feeling sick and nauseous, or feel detached from yourself. It can also induce anxiety. It'd be one of my last picks. Probably not gonna get this kind of strain again. At least not by ASCND.”"

manufacturedba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-dream/reviews/1647281,"“I don't smoke weed really, but I keep this in my office drawer at all times. If I ever need to really get anything done, I'll go for a hit. Creativity and focus completely activate for me. If you need to do some self-reflection, this will get you there.”"
Sceps,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-dream/reviews/1570347,"“Outstanding! The smoke aroma is amazing and it made me extremely happy and uplifted. Perfect daytime strain for depression or mad moods.”"
TerrapinTurtle96,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-dream/reviews/1656868,"“Absolutely loved the high from this strain. Nice gentle come up, creative yet not nonsensical, focused yet dreamy. Tastes absolutely amazing as well. I hope to keep smoking this one!”"
