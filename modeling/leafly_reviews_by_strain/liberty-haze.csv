Hints of smokey citrus with a unique finish that I can't quite pin down but like, a lot!  Effects are immediate and duration is a solid 2 hours or more.  Pain relief is excellent and effects are euphoric and just happy, happy, happy.  Consistent and never disappoints.  Solid 9!”"

Most underwhelming strained I've had to date.”"
