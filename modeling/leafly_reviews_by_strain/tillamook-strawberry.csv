First of all, the smell: Sweet strawberries with hints of diesel. The aroma alone made my mouth water, and my expectations were met with the taste and effects that followed. The diesel taste is more prominent on the exhale (not a negative in my book, but it w...”"

My neck, entire spine, hips, knees, hands (I know I a mess)  and blinding migraines. This helps all of those a lot while I'm relaxing. It does help the pain some while I am moving around doing things. 

But where this really shines is when you're chillin. I love to take a couple fat hits off the bong and watch a good movie with a comfy blanket. It helps the ...”"

OrdinaryBud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tillamook-strawberry/reviews/1484765,"“Tillamook Strawberry produced by Cowlitz Gold personally provides the effects and flavors described on its Leafly description. At ~0.25g smoked flower, provides strong stress relief, euphoria, and appreciation for sound. At ~0.5g smoked flower, aforementioned effects intensify and mild short-term memory loss and time distortion occurs.

Cheers!”"

My mom said my eyes were strawberry red. But my eyes went heavy. Then i went down for the count. All in all. A good weed for me to use before bed.”"
Chemel.no.5,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tillamook-strawberry/reviews/1590645,"“This Tillamook Strawberry is light at first and then speeds up a little into a smooth ride. Nice cruise with an old friend when you just need to sit back, relax, and melt the wrinkles of worry of your face. It will hold your hand and stroke your hair while telling you that everything is going to be okay. She will quickly yet gentle run over your anxiety speed bumps. However, you'll be a wallflower when the beats drop...”"
StateofMorgan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tillamook-strawberry/reviews/1576853,"“This is the only strain I can smoke and be 100% certain things will get done. I smoke other strains for pre-chore energy--like Alpha Blue or Stella Blue--but they don't come with a guarantee I'll stay on task. Tillamook Strawberry is FOCUSED. I can smoke a couple of hours before work, and even if I haven't totally sobered up, I know I'm cool. I look and act sober and am actually capable of thinking clearly despite of...”"

GrapesonGrapesonGrapes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tillamook-strawberry/reviews/1485995,"“A very pleasant strain to chief on. This strain is very mood softening and is a great all day smoke. Provides some nice relaxation coupled with a clear focus. The buds are long, frosty, and compact. The color is a limey green with amber and yellow calyxes. The smell was a nutty sweet vanilla. The taste is sweet and woody, with the slightest bit of kush flavor. This hard to come by lady is an absolute pleasure to expe...”"

momoneymel,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tillamook-strawberry/reviews/1672811,"“It entices you with a subtly sweet smell; smooth inhale and smooth exhale. The remaining taste of diesel left in my mouth and nose feels too heavy and strong.”"
