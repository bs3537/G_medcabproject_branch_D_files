Looks like Sour D just purple tinted and more of a purple smell. It makes you very medicated yet still focused. It had the sativa effects in the eyes but calming mellow mood of an indica. Good hybrid.”"

It was smooth, but that's probably because of the ice. The taste is delicate, but you can definitely taste the purple. The high is at first an immediate buzz behind the eyes and near the bottom back of your head, and I felt euphoric and motivated to do things.
