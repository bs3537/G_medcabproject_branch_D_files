Dr. Quantum
=============
Rexhungus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dr-quantum/reviews/1550013,"“Nice relaxing high. Can give you a strong head high and pressure behind the eyes; however, you will feel nice and relaxed. I recently bought some and tried it on it's own and found that it shared some similarities with Sunset Sherbet. Now I grind up both strains and make a cocktail, which I smoke at night and everything slows down and life becomes more peaceful.”"
