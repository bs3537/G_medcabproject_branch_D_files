bigpopachuck,https://www.leafly.com/indica/818-og/reviews/1380945,"“This is amazing bud. It's high in THC, but does not cause any paranoia and it also leaves me clear headed; so, I can focus- instead of sitting around with couch-lock and memory loss.... Helps my pain in my lower back and neck dissappear. I am very happy and satisfied with this strain. A+++++”"

After my 2nd dab I started feeling my body relax from toe to head. Which was unique since I usually first feel relaxation toward top of my body then the relaxation moves downward.
Very rarely do I get hungry. I actually forget to eat a lot. Can't go...”"

LAComposer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/818-og/reviews/1469016,"“One of my favorites, next to L.S.D..  Thi bud never seems to fail or live up to its name.  This is one of those strains (or so it seems), that if it hasn't been flushed (burn grey/black), had mold, was harvested to early = racy, it never seems to matter, popcorn​ shrimp size buds to big apple size buds, it always seems to smoke the same.
