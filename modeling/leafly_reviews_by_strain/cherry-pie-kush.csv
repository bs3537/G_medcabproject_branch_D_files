Hiphop33,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-pie-kush/reviews/1350938,"“Favorite strain to grow so far... Very easy all around. Yields great!! Smells, looks, and taste fantastic!! Easy to prune and trim. Gorrilla glue 4 is the only plant I have seen that is as healthy looking and still super chronic... Usually herb this good is very delicate or finicky. Not the highest thc content but the high is smooth all the way around. Great weed anytime of day. Love it!! -HipHop-”"

My high pain days operate around a 12, so this dropped it down to about a seven which is Definitely more manageable. A smooth smoke, no choking, nice flavor. Consider adding this to your nighttime routine if you don't have one already.”"

The buds are fluffy and sticky as hell. Coated with some nice deep red calyxes. The smell had that classic Kush odor and sweet fruitiness. The flavors are really quite nice. Very smooth earthiness, with a noticeably sweet exhale. The flavor really sticks on the palate. Great strain for depression, social anxiety and pt...”"
