I usually focus on hybrids and sativas as I really love the cranial love I get from them. But today I had to get a gram of the King Kush. This is indica gold... Midas is touching my brain right now and I am blissing out at the ...”"

Very powerful effects, very potent strain, highly recommend to vet's and even new comers but with caution. This strain is everything you want an Indica to be, couch lock is inevitable but it also has a very relaxing numbing sensation which is what I like the most about it. Great for insomnia, pain, spasms, depression & anxiety. If you see this strain at you...”"

Excellent strain if you're looking to reduce sleeping issues or stress (that's what I used it for, most effective of the strains I've tried more than once).

Sugared nugs covered in almost seasalt looking trichomes. Flower is dark green with a tad of purple mixed in. Smell is classic kush, and when you open the jar it hits you like a train. Pungent kush taste follows through to the last vape draw. Onset is a tingling in on the hands and a vibration in the vision. An overall feeling of we...”"
vanzy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/king-kush/reviews/1370498,"“I found this strain to have the "placebo" effect. Sesh with the ideal plan being I wanna get stuff done, and I'm full of energy for hours. Sesh with the ideal plan of wanting to sleep and just pass the f out! Wonderful smoke..kinda harsh but doesn't leave you coughing up a lung. Sweet taste and def has a nice stank to it.”"
JoshLoc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/king-kush/reviews/1397358,"“Love this strain, such pretty buds. Purply green buds with a nice silver coating. Tastes like OG with a hint of grape. Some couch lock, but nothing you couldn't fix with a coffee. I love OG and Grape so this is just a give in.  Pressed into really nice rosin, with a good return.”"
