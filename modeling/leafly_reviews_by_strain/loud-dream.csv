Zypherus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-dream/reviews/1334214,"“Quick burn and earthy flavor had me worried at first, but effects were top notch. Pleased to see it so highly rated in positive effects and low on negatives. If the flavor was as sweet as the bouquet, this could be my favorite, but certainly in top 10 as it stands.”"

Makes you very happy very focused also had a strong tingly feeling and makes you focus.This is a hood strain for HDHD because it makes you focus and good for depression because it makes you happy (i have neither of which)”"
Foulestbird1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-dream/reviews/1340498,"“Really good strain. Tastes and gives a good high. Would recommend.”"
AlphaLeo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-dream/reviews/1335668,"“Definitely has me upbeat. Great for smoking with a group or in a party/going out setting. I get why some people are saying it leaves you paranoid, but I think it's just a feeling of excitement the bud gives you. The taste is decent and the actual smoking of it is very smooth. Won't have you coughing a lot.”"
Sm0kiE,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-dream/reviews/1410890,"“I just smoked a gram of this and I'm stuck, quiet, not hungry, tired, very relaxed, no dry mouth, something you smoke by yourself.”"
Daggg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-dream/reviews/1211339,"“Loud exudes a strangely unique aroma, and produces an energetic, thoughtful high. My mind felt refreshed as it was flooded with positive ideas and emotions. It is not a strain that would completely knock someone off their feet -- mild, 'barely-there' body high.”"

Klearwork,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-dream/reviews/1323224,"“Great strain, makes you feel relaxed but focused gives you a good boost throughout the day really controllable, the only thing that I didn't like about it was the fact that it took me more hits then usual to get lifted.”"

hjointsmoke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-dream/reviews/1240761,"“Fun, up beat high. Very social buzz that kicks in pretty quick and lasts for a few hrs as it mellows out into the munchies and a good movie to fall asleep to. Just woke up and there is food everywhere and I really dont remember passing out. Strong B+, not enough indica feeling for my pain relief needs, but great bud for a little kick back or hiking, versatile medicine for me”"
MrSigmundF,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-dream/reviews/1181642,"“With Hairs like Mufassa, the Dream is a plush and full nugget. The crystals aren't as abundant as some prefer, but the immediate taste and aroma compensates by far. A great relaxer that helped wit my back pain as well as my anxiety.  Look forward to a thoughtful Euphoric high that compliments the unique looking furry bud”"

torch8306,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-dream/reviews/1775389,"“Powerful. One hit of dry herb off a vaping pen, and within seconds, it hit the frontal lobe. That one hit lasted, more than four hours, strongly. I was immediately relaxed and let the tingling in my forehead rock me with my pulse. For my shell-shock depression/PTSD, it gives you the best feelings of an Indica dominant hybrid and yet, you get a fantastic buzz, an active buzz. I never felt sleepy.”"
