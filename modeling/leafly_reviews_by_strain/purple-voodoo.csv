Coming across quality thai strains are like christmas for me, and this is like that one "big" present hidden behind the tree just when you think you didn't get what you "really" wanted that year. Its that good. Thai (purple, I hear) x AK47. Seriously a kick to the head that has every orifice in your head dripping but in that, "good god, this is what cannabis should be like" sort of way. VERY heavy, very intense...”"

also, it smells like magic.”"

Gives you an intoxicating head high while smoking it and leaves you staring off into space for the next hour and a half after that. As an experienced smoker I must say this is one of my favorite "purple" strains I have ever tried and would recommend to others for insomnia and pain.”"
MonkleBerryHound,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-voodoo/reviews/1373107,"“I just got ahold of this strain and I think I am in love. This is a legitimate hybrid. You get qualities you love from both indica and sativa. This is one of the few hybrid strains that has a totally clear head high for me. My head tends to feel more cloudy with other hybrids. Whether I am running errands, working, just relaxing or a quick hit to help with bed time, this is a great strain. It has a lovely taste as we...”"
splifroll22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-voodoo/reviews/1237922,"“This Purple Voodoo is no joke.  For real, I took like one maybe two hits and I was good.  You will feel is in your body like almost instantly except your head feels clear like a sativa, but with out the sped up thoughts.   HIGH GRADE DANK BUD”"

Was a little sad to find that you must place a $2,500 order for them to even deal with you (comes with 25 strains 2 each). .Also they used to come in packs of 14, now they come in packs of 10. Needless to say, all 10 of my PV'S poped ;) Will update in mid flower!!”"

kpv113,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-voodoo/reviews/1191683,"“They're completely correct (Leafly) about the effects of this strain. It's energetic and clear, but relaxing and giggly at the same time. Well worth smoking!”"

JohnnyDopesick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-voodoo/reviews/1382032,"“Dopest dope I ever smoked! Some of the best medicine in Vancouver BC right now. Smells good, looks better, smokes great. Killer head high mixed with a lazy but tingly body buzz. I use this stuff exclusively for my tendonitis, anxiety, and methadone-induced nausea. 10 outta 10!”"
Riddlechip,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-voodoo/reviews/1382031,"“This is a fantastic strain! Smell is pungent with an earthy aroma. This heavy indica hit the eyes very quickly followed with full body relaxation. Found it very hard to be focussed during the sedation but being an indica and evening sedation, I wasn't bothered by it. Very enjoyable strain for relaxing alone time!”"
TheCanadianKid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-voodoo/reviews/1159824,"“I feel like the flavours don't do this bad boy justice. I smelt a lot of pine. and tasted a very nice earthy/pine like flavour. And it really is NOT dank. but don't let the lack of smellyness deter you...this so far is my favourite strain.”"

I was having quite severe neck pain and after vaping this my pain melted away 😀 It also provided a very relaxed feeling with a strong body stone and made me sleepy after about an hour and a half. A stellar evening/nighttime medical strain!! 👍🏻”"

I grew from seed and noticed at least 4 different phenos.  Had a hard time with nutrient sensitivity, but the 3 I pulled out successfully all had different flavors.  the Voodoo really took off in flower producing some very purple, VERY berry, grape, orange peel, juice aromatic, sweet yet skunky smells and FLAVORS.

valagra,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-voodoo/reviews/1193588,"“The bag I got wasn't the best grow ever but still, hard to get that right hybrid and this is one of them that hits! 

The cheese parentage comes through really nice, but still has its own "voodoo" spicy-sweetness to it.

Great for day or night, great for increasing appetite and creativity. In larger doses droopy eyes and muscle relaxation happens, but it's not a couch lock, more wave like, calm.”"

Purple VooDoo has a amazing balance of giving you a relaxing high yet a upper body high. Good taste, fruity and sweet. AMAZING Hybrid strain. Definitely a strain you can smoke and still be social and work affectively if your a regular smoker.”"

It was such a clean high I didn't know what to do with myself. Super productive, energetic, but still had nice body high qualities. On a negative, I suffer from intense anxiety and it seemed to make me even more anxious/paranoid...about everything. I admit I was milking this strain and not switching ...”"

It’s more indica for sure and I’ve also laughed my ass off on it a few times. I got 10gs and Pax 3. Real chill real nice. Very heady and eyes sink deep in a way. Music is awesome. Great for hitting the airport as it lasts a couple hours. 

Cool strain. Was great getting to know it. Wish I had more.”"

Perfect midday strain due to its 50/50 thc content. 30%+ thc levels to knock you out but not down cause the sativa gives an interesting tingly sensation that balances just right.

Not quite indica not quite sativa but not like a blend of the two. Slightly up, and clear.  Not much euphoria to speak of, music is not enhanced and thinking is straight.
