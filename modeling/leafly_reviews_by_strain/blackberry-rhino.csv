MiseryXchord,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-rhino/reviews/1321056,"“Tastes sweet and fruity as green vapor moving to nutty brown hits, responds well to decarb'ing, and makes excellent canna-butter. 
Effect is relaxing and calming to GI spasticity, providing good relief for chronic nausea and vomiting caused by celiac and autoimmune disease.”"

elharris69,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-rhino/reviews/1130856,"“Blackberry Rhino is quite a good strain to choose for pain relief.  It's a nice, potent Indica whose effects are euphoric and surreal, and easily taps into the imagination.   The high is heavily oriented in the body, causing a comforting, warm sort of relief.  Its flavor is very sweet, with a slightly sour, fruity taste, with a smell a bit reminiscent to strains like Fruity Pebbles.”"

MoonstoneConnection,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-rhino/reviews/1374487,"“I thought it would be better. it was good. however taste and short effect we're an issue. It was a premium priced strain and I expected allot. Buzz was fairly intent but short lived. Taste was harsher with less Berry and more rhino...good sleep aid.”"
