crpowell312,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-candy/reviews/1416885,"“A very good Sativa effect. I was impressed with the taste and longevity of the effects. Was medicated for hours feeling very uplifted and happy. Took care of my anxiety and I had no problems doing day to day activities. Overall very good strain, I would definitely recommend giving  it a try.”"
Mason84,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-candy/reviews/1416886,"“This is my new favorite sativa.  The buds on the batch I acquired are huge and covered in trichomes.  The smell is amaing although there wasn't much of a taste to it.  Nice smooth, expansive smoke that will take even the seasoned smokers to new hights.  This strain is perfect for day time use and wake and bakes.  The high is one of the longer lasting ones I've experienced, especially for a sativa.  Green Candy is a m...”"
Crucian1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-candy/reviews/1416887,"“A true sativa with great uplift and buds that are robust and dense. Its a solid 8.5 for me.  Blended well with Skywalker!  Thanks Swell.”"
UncleAcid,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-candy/reviews/1416891,"“If you have anxiety issues I recommend you either find another strain, or mix it with a heavy Indica to balance it out.

Beautiful, sweet, sugary and skunky-pungent smells reel from these compact little nugs. But (and keep in mind, I smoke all day everyday) this stuff just rubbed me the wrong way when smoked alone. I got The Fear, which I hadn't really experienced in awhile. It mellowed out after I smoked a little sn...”"

I haven't been in the best mood lately someone close to me died. I picked this up while grieving and it made me feel so much better!
Colors were more stimulating, everything had a glow to it, and the world seemed like a brighter place.
best antidepressant ever”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-candy/reviews/1416888,"“Beautiful and delicious. The dispensary listed it as a "spiritual buzz," and I couldn't agree more. It is very uplifting, inspiring, and creative in nature. 

The aroma is VERY fruity and EXTREMELY strong. One pinch and your nostrils are filled with the delicious aroma of this quality medicine. 

It is my new favorite sativa.”"
Steamer2k14,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-candy/reviews/1365586,"“Green Candy has been, by a wide margin, the best smoke I've had so far. With only a few puffs of this potent sativa all of my stress and anxiety melted away along with waves of euphoria and all my aches and pains disappearing. I was especially pleased that this strain didn't cause me any paranoia as some sativas can, and left me focused, energized and feeling great. If Green Crack's high had too much of an edge for y...”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-candy/reviews/1585682,"“First go around with this strain was flower, it was like a very sweet tasting Green Crack. Definitely tastes like candy!
I've never had Candy Kush on it's own, but I'm guessing the candy tastes comes from the candy kush, duh.
This is a great strain for lethargy, depression, stress, nausea, and pain. I wouldn't recommend this for anxiety prone patients. 
This is the perfect sativa for wake & bake sessions. Or as a pic...”"

The flavor is average, a bright green taste with a hint of flowers and pine. It's labeled Green Candy, so it could be Green Crack or it could be the Green Candy hybrid, Green Crack x Candy Kush.  SOOO few budtenders know the difference, but I suspect this to be the hybrid. It has the more mild feel I associate with Candy vs the energetic edge I as...”"
DMFF,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/green-candy/reviews/1416892,"“Known to me locally as "Christmas Bud", I normally only see this strain around in September through January.

Tastes of sweet smoke fill my lungs. It's almost like smoking sugared pot. Makes you feel very energetic at first if you smoke a sm...”"
