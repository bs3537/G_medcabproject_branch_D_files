Mainefirebreather,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/special-k/reviews/1363219,"“This is a very nice, earthy strain. The smell is identical to lemongrass, with herbal overtones. The effects are very energetic and happy sensations. It is not too head strong and very easy-going.”"
Squidears,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/special-k/reviews/1340020,"“Wonderful high. It was very uplifting and left me feeling energetic, but not jittery. Would definitely recommend.”"

TechnoNshWeed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/special-k/reviews/1347537,"“Had "Organic" Special K and not sure what the real difference was. Anyway, copy and paste from a different source: "It features a smell that is both spicy and citrus. It offers a citrus taste that is very enjoyable. This is a hybrid of Northern Lights and Afghani. It is potent with THC around 23% and it isn’t recommended for first time users of cannabis. Special K is bright green in color. As the time comes near for ...”"

jimmyinspazzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/special-k/reviews/1493910,"“Loose little buds that did not taste nor smell very appetizing. Good for mixing up in salads with other more tasty strains. For a hybrid the buzz was decent with both a strong pull towards the head and also body.  This can feel strangulating if these feelings overlap which is often why I deter from hybrids.  This was not the case with Special K at all, but instead a balanced back & forth between.  Good for light pain...”"
Indicaem,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/special-k/reviews/1295907,"“I smoked a full Indica version of this strain and found it amazingly sedating.  I have insomnia and found this really helped me get to sleep.  It has a sweet earthy flavour and a beautiful green bud with yellow hues throughout.  This is another one of my favourites grown by East Van Boutiques.”"
