I slept like a champ.”"
BabyKermit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-treat/reviews/1415289,"“After experiencing some awful anxiety, I vaped a bowl. I usually vape a couple bowls to medicate myself, but I totally forgot about my second bowl with this strain. 😝 It's a great for anxiety, The high feels very balanced. A top shelf Hybrid in my opinion. 👌”"
