Lowryder
=============
ivdemocracyvi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1369228,"‚ÄúI'm a very heavy hitter (been smoking for 5 years almost every day) and jsut 2 hits got me buzzed and 4 hits got me very stoned. This is honestly one of the the best strains I've ever had. It has a smooth and tasty smoke to it also. I'm definetely growing more of this. I recommend to everyone!‚Äù"
HashNGag,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1369226,"‚ÄúGood, energetic high. A nice smoke for the afternoon if you want to relax but stay alert (perfect for after office work). 

Good for vaping, nice smell and taste with citrics tones across vaping, starting with a peach-like flavor when vaping a freshly ground bowl (TASTY AF). 

Have not smoked it yet - will update this review over the weekend.

Munchies? average.‚Äù"
POPUPBLOCKERON,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1369227,"‚ÄúAnxiety slasher that is the best 50/50 (S/I) split in my experience so far.  Absolutely great for a daytime med., to treat anxiety, depression and PTSD.  Never a dissapointement.‚Äù"
Deetom,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1677457,"‚ÄúMy first grow was Lowryder 2. Easy to grow. Very fast flowering. not very sensitive to neglect (I had a few close calls with some of my girls lacking hydration during the flowering stage). Even under rough growing conditions, these ladies bounce right back. Quite productive. Odour varied from plant to plant. Some smelled piney, others more flowery. Some girls had a slight whiff of skunk (but really very little). Not ...‚Äù"

Lowryder #2 by the way‚Äù"
corninmypoopies,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1569779,"‚Äútakes about 15 mintues to kick in. clean pine flavor. very strong. heavy couch lock, random thoughts and moderate time distortion. melts pain away. super cotton mouth. high lasts quite a while. sleep like a baby after smoking this.‚Äù"
C00KIESKUSH,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1369229,"‚Äúpersonally I loved this strain. easy to grow, easy to smoke üëç‚Äù"
228420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1181278,"‚ÄúHarvested early this strain gives a more heady high with slight mind change and sets me in a good mood. I'd give it 4,5 it's very good. even not fully mature it's strong and energetic, but takes some time to creep on you. smell is amazing - very fruity with citrus tones. I'm not disappointed üëç‚Äù"
GanjaDwarf92,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1359973,"‚ÄúDrunk buzz(5-10shots eqv). Hungry, hands fight with me making them harder to operate. Face muscles relax. Might feel like smiling or laughing for no reason. However i thought the smell of the vaporized cannabis was not pleasant, never smelled anything like it, but perhaps skunky or smoked skunk? not very pleasant, so i tended to not breathe with my nose, so i wouldn't  have to smell it. Thats why only 3 stars. 20-40 ...‚Äù"
weedweekly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1143189,"‚ÄúStrong and potent weed. Starts off slowly but kicks in with speed of light and you're blazed! 

Hunger may occur.‚Äù"

Joeyfish,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1306617,"‚ÄúGood/Bad... Mainly good! :D The smoke feels pretty unique and the first impression i got was that it makes you very energized in body; almost jittery (can be taken as good or bad, but i liked) I found myself very creative when smoking this bud, but to express these idea's to others (talkative trait) depends on how much you smoke. If you have a lot, it can sometimes be very difficult to get thoughts out your mouth. Ho...‚Äù"
Banglahd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1177521,"‚ÄúGreat vape, with an ok taste.
Helps my nystagmus calm abit, and takes the focus away from the eyes.  A great night time "smoke" that relaxes the body and mind.‚Äù"

JDiamonds93,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1603337,"‚ÄúOrdered some seeds online from ams where they call it dwarf ganja along with a few other auto flower strains. So far this has grown so much quicker and bushier than the other strains with a strong dank smell. Only 5 weeks from sprouting and covered in hairy crystallised buds, can't wait to smoke this bad boy‚Äù"
SnowDemon18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1326903,"‚ÄúThis strain has an almost fruity aroma that's very nice. It makes you VERY giggly and takes a little to kick in but then it hits you like a ton of bricks. It's amazing. I would highly recommend it.‚Äù"
MentalWolf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1238257,"‚ÄúReally good high, smells great, super strong stuff. Hit me hard‚Äù"
HighInHelsinki,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lowryder/reviews/1354875,"‚ÄúMiddle of the road high, well balanced and nothing specific to mention. Three stars just for the lack of impression. Personal thing. It is good basic weed.‚Äù"
