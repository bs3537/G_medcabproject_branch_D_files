deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1417526,"‚Äúü§óüå≤ MediHaze is the ULTIMATE wake & bake strain! I didn't know what to expect so I made sure it was a strain I tried with a freshly rested mind. The smell and taste was very spicy and earthy... honestly kind of reminds me of the old school pretendo that used to float around. The high is fantatsic. There needs to be more CBD in strains because for such a low percentage of THC (4.76%), MediHaze has a wonderful high an...‚Äù"
badangel00013,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1417579,"‚ÄúMediHaze, (aka Boaty McBoatface)  The strain I got was double the CBD from Tweed. Nice smell, smooth smoke, effects come on around 10-15mins later. Nice and alert, good low dose thc makes the head tingle a little but great for daytime and being social. Uplifting high and a great pain reliever. A perfect intro for people new to medical marijuana about feeling the psychoactive effects. So this for me (new here) love it...‚Äù"
psychedelicshrugs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1411097,"‚ÄúI got this under the name Boaty McBoatface from Tweed with 4/9 thc/cbd. This is a great beginner strain. It helps with my physical pain and keeps my anxiety at bay, while maintaining a clear head. No feeling high, just a pleasant, comfortable, chillness. 
It does cause me major dry mouth, very mild (and tolerable) nausea, and suppresses my appetite.‚Äù"
feistyalita,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1414888,"‚ÄúI was looking for something, ANYTHING , to alleviate nausea from treatment and I am able to eat, keep it down AND still function!‚Äù"
nmchuck,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1378736,"‚ÄúThis is one of my top 5. I'm always excited to see it on the menu, which around here (Roswell, NM) is every few months.

An incredibly relaxing strain. Calms my muscle spasms and makes me remember to eat...a lot. The munchies are strong with this one.‚Äù"
Tathagata,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1382329,"‚ÄúMedi Haze is a great strain for daytime use, with a light, uplifting buzz which helps with focus.

Medi Haze has a strong, sweet strawberry/slightly skunky smell. The taste is similar, with a light peppery taste on the exhale. I vaporise this most days and it positively impacts my productivity at work, as well as my general mood. My partner suffers from stress and anxiety and found that this strain sent her straight ...‚Äù"
AbbieKind,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1539466,"‚ÄúI now know what it's like for cannabis to combat depression and fatigue. Sometimes I just wanna smoke weed that doesn't make me feel like I smoked weed. I feel physically energetic, clear headed, happy and "normal." The high CBD makes it more difficult to accidentally oversmoke and crash. No dizzies, swimmies, sleepys or munchies. My new favorite wake n' bake!!!

wra1979,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1417523,"‚ÄúMedihaze from Patriot Care in Boston is currently my favorite strain for medicinal use and in my top 5 for recreational use. It is a 2:1 CBD:THC and the THC percentage usually hovers in the 5-9% THC. It provides a great little head high but a amazing body high and a general overall effect.

Jack_P,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1398490,"‚ÄúThis is my number one daytime strain for fatigue, anxiety, and depression. I got this at The Kings of Canna with 16.3% CBD and 4.3% THC. Just one or two hits in the morning and the same again at lunch and I'm nicely productive during the day. No munchies, no paranoia, just clear, better energy and focus. Otherwise I'm exhausted all day. Gotta love that limonene sativa high CBD low THC mix.‚Äù"

Neo-Hippie,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1413546,"‚ÄúThis is the first high-CBD strain that I've tried and it took about 3/4's of a bowl before I really felt the relaxing effects. Keeping in mind I smoke all exclusively minimal cbd bud(0.0-1.0%) usually, this was a suprisingly delightful strain it relaxed me without putting me to sleep which is strange for a strain with 19% CBD.

Tzone,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1389741,"‚ÄúThe MediHaze I purchased has a 1:2 THC/CBD ratio (5.03% THC, 10.3% CBD). I found the strain very mellow, easy, relaxing.‚Äù"

Simply amazing, doesn‚Äôt get me super duper stoned (which I prefer at night) and therefore helps me function throughout the day. I find with some sativas, I tend to get tired later in the day.

vcuramsuperfan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1361839,"‚ÄúIncredible strain. Without a doubt the best study aid I have ever used.
