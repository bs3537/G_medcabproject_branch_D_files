Good for those looking for the benefits of a high CBD strain or those who want a little high without being too stoned. Light, earthy yet sweet smell. Subtle spicy and sweet flavor.”"
mashoogana,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dance-world/reviews/1413530,"“Really awesome THC/CBD combo. Mellow, happy, conversational, and therapeutic. I have had numerous surgeries for my knee, ankle, etc, and this strain really helps with the pain. Additionally, being ADHD, it really helps with my spastic behavior, hyperactivity, and slowing down my thoughts. Best thing about it is being able to start at a small dose of THC, and increase, rather than other strains that knock your socks o...”"

The high CBD is great for intestinal issues.  And it also was very functional.  Lower THC made it so the CBD just made you feel nice.  Great for anxiety.”"

mlmm,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dance-world/reviews/1383691,"“Got this at Uncle Ike's in Seattle while visiting last year. Really helped my son's pain without making him fall asleep or just be too messed up. Just as the reviews said. We wish we lived where this was available as we really think it would give him great help on fibromyalgia pain, migraine pain, and depression. Thank you to the guys at Uncle Ike's for a great recommendation.”"
bobc4t,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dance-world/reviews/1320554,"“Medical patients with inflamatory issues and stomach problems this high CBD with low THC is fantastic for first timers.  First strain I purchased and very much a body relaxation effect.  very focused and able to be productive.  as a newbie to the medical experiences I can see the 8th I purchased lasting me a while.”"
SuperFishDiego,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dance-world/reviews/1389050,"“This strain is INCREDIBLE. It has a super nice fruity aroma to it and hits very smoothly. A very relaxed non super Stoney high. 

I grew this strain myself for it's high CBD properties. The plant grew just over 3' tall and 2' wide, vegged for one month, topped once, flowered for 9 weeks total with the last two months in just water (grown hydroponically). Grows very trouble free and was the best out of three strains. ...”"

chaaanny,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dance-world/reviews/1769006,"“I cannot speak for this strain if you’re using it for recreational purposes, but for medicinal purposes, this strain of RSO probably saved my life (literally).
I use RSO Dance World twice daily to treat supposedly “treatment resistant” depression and anxiety. I can be sensitive to sativa/more activating strains, as they usually increase my anxiety, but considering the almost 4:1 CBD:THC ratio (if my math is correct),...”"
Path78,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dance-world/reviews/1379598,"“My first Sativa was quite a pleasant surprise. As a novice, I have been sticking with CBD strains, and Dance World did not disappoint. 

The flavor was spicy with a slightly earthy edge with a touch of tartness at the tail end. 

This strain made me feel uplifted, yet relaxed at the same time which was a unique sensation. I really appreciated feeling calm, but not inebriated. I was relatively clear headed and able to...”"
tdub3024,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dance-world/reviews/1200617,"“Picked this up today mostly for my wife. But I was excited to try this strain out. As you see this is very CBD heavy. Ratio is close to even THC. The head high was very mellow. Body very relaxed. Not my personal favorite as far as getting ripped and playing video games. But very chill and mellow overall high. 

Side notes:
lower back pain was gone after smoking.
I did end up smoking a different strain to get a strong...”"
lmatter,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dance-world/reviews/1557109,"“I wish this strain was more readily available. Helps with inflammation and arthritic issues in my neck so that I have no need for ibuprofen any longer. Subtle high which relaxes stiff muscles.”"

Glen_coco,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dance-world/reviews/1283582,"“This strain produces a very clean and clear head buzz. It is not very euphoric but it is pleasant. the buds can be quite strong even though it's a high CBD variety. You are left kinda functional and pretty energetic even when you're very high on it. It's a good daytime strain for everyday use because of the healthy CBD content but it's not really the right one if you want to get stoned and super relaxed. So it doesn'...”"

Lot's of variation in height from plant-to-plant. My skunk no. 1's are flowering *much* earlier, and my DW's are all over the map; most are maybe 3 weeks from finishing & one is just now showing frost. New hybrid I guess. Lavender. VERY lavender (which is nice, IMHO). Not getting the citrus &c. at all actually. All seeds sp...”"

ColonelBlimp70,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dance-world/reviews/1723985,"“This strain is quite mild with an even balance of CBD/THC.
I liken this strain more to alcohol rather than cannabis. To me the effects are very similar to a few Dry Martinis, with very little in the way of the usual effects of cannabis. 
I recommend this strain to those who have issues with pain, inflammation and sleep, but still need to be functional.
All in all, a middle of the road strain, no great redeeming featu...”"
