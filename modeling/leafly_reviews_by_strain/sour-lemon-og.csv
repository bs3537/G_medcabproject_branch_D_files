Got me high pretty quickly and I didn't really feel any negatives. 8/10 would recommend. Good with helping aches and pains and soreness. Made me forget how much my back hurt from sleeping on an air mattress. It also helps lower my stress level from seeing family I don't normally see and actually talking with them.”"

Got a half O from a friend and I rolled up three proper fatties, and in the fattest of the 3, I put probably about half a gram of kief from the last 3 months I've saved up.

Gotta tell ya, this is some quality shit. Great strain, heaviness in back of eyes, euphoric body and head high. Taking me a while to type this. My ribs feel warm and fuzzy.”"

The vapor at 350 degrees is hardly discernable ... but don't be fooled, the high rises quickly and for me, a small dose (half-filled Ascent chamber and 3-4 draws) is just perfect.

The high is super quick and very mellow.    The ta...”"

First, the smell: simply crisp and clean, evoking a sensation of clearheadedness.

Next, the smoke - also very clean, not too dry.

The high is stimulating, but not speedy. It is relaxing, but not groggy or prone to couch lock.

I appreciate a creativity boost and a proneness toward action and spontaneity.

Some things I noted: a moderate, but not extreme, increase in paranoia, b...”"
