InnerVision42,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-magic/reviews/1413744,"“I had initially purchased this under the impression it was an Indica Hybrid but according to leafly this is a Sativa. No matter, I really did enjoy this one. 

I smoked 0.17g out of a pipe. I felt like the herb was slightly moist so this weight may be inflated a bit. 

The taste was distinctly citrusy and sweet. The combusted smoke did smell a bit cheesy and unpleasant (to me) but I noted none of these flavors and th...”"

EdibleEm,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-magic/reviews/1383485,"“Smoking this one is pretty magical haha but seriously, I love lots about this strain. For me it has a blueberry fruity smell with a nice tobacco punch at the end. Lots of nice hairs and a sticky texture. Burned easy in the water bong and no real coughing, easy on the asthma. Excellent euphoria off the top but does really mellow to a nice relaxation. Description says focused but not me- I caught myself a couple times ...”"

RLO,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-magic/reviews/1304010,"“I am not usually a big fan of sativa dominant strains but boy did I find an exception in Blue Magic. A strong initial sense of euphoria followed by a very smooth sense of relaxation. Picked up a gram pre-roll of this from Pakalolo, will definitely go back to buy some of the beautiful buds.”"

Boy let me tell you,  it has been 3 weeks since I bought this potent gem and I STILL can't get more than 2 or 3 tokes before I am just baked to the core. It's a creeping buzz and when it hits it's like a real smooth, warm body high. And then i smelled blueberry muffins for the rest of the night. I know i seriously thou...”"

Canadab,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-magic/reviews/1736399,"“First of all, this is a hybrid, not a straight sativa. A bowl or two of this is amazing. Really relaxes you, but you’re able to focus on whatever you’re doing. I was so relaxed I took a nap. Great strain for whatever you need to to”"
OGkammingucci,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-magic/reviews/1546542,"“This strain is one of the best that I have ever smoked. I vaped it when I had it for the first time and it really was like magic. The taste was overwhelmingly great and it kicks in really fast. You really get a boost of energy everything seems so wonderful. At a given moment it started to begin a bit psychedelic. When I was looking at a person, then the background started to move. The second time that I smoked this s...”"

Nice strong Sativa that had my mind racing at first but. Soon that goes away and u feel on the euphoric high that last a good while.  I will say this strain gave me the munchies like I ain’t ever had lmao, so I u need something to jump start the appetite this is the one .”"

Potent blueberry/citrus/hazy smell and  taste. The high starts in the head, tweaking your vision and giving you a little energy boost. Euphoric feelings soon set in with a very mild body high. Awsome for getting high early and still getting things done. The nugs are very nice to look at, bright green with red/pinkish hairs and plenty...”"
