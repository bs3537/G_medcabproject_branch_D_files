TootsMgoots,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/urkle-train-haze/reviews/1391946,"“It's a little  schizophrenic...super strong cerebral high up front with a dizzy head... then it settles into someting heavy around the top of your head and drips like melted lead down over your shoulders. You're still a little head stoned, but then it work its ways down to your toes and then you get really really heavy. Good stuff. Maybe not for everyone, but it's definitely for me.”"

It's relaxing and happy, yet l can focus and get things done around the house. Got pretty creative with cooking an awesome dinner for my family and in a fun entertaining mood for the kids even despite a horrible migraine .

Starts out kinda head buzzing at first, but will soon later come into a body relaxing, peaceful euphoric, happy high. Left my body tingly and me laughing a lot. This is definitely a come home from work, and melt away your stresses and worries, and just chill.....and get super baked out of your mind.
Medical use is this is a super hap...”"

I'm female, in my late 40s and struggle with symptoms of fibromyalgia and PTSD including pain, nausea, fatigue, IBS, insomnia, restless legs and multiple others.

Excellent pa relief in a matter of no time, I was on my 3rd vape pull when I felt that wave run down my body flushing out all the aches and pains. Very nice flavor, hits heavy but nice light pine, city’s notes. Besides the body effects, I found UTH to be a sneaky cerebral high. Took a little while but before I knew it I was contemplating things I normally don’t and doing a life ass...”"

AmeliaFlowers13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/urkle-train-haze/reviews/1275078,"“This has become my favorite strain OF ALL.

 I loved Purple Urkle...and I still do. I still keep Purple Urkle on hand for it's sedative effects.... but Urkle Train Haze is truly THE BEST of both worlds. I suffer from PTSD....and Ghost Train Haze is a little too much on the cerebral side for me...it makes me feel overly caffeinated and jittery....but is a favorite among many people who do not have trouble with anxiety...”"
