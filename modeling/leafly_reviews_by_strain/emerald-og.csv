matthewearl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1413953,"“First thanks for Bhang Society in North Hollywood for getting me this new strain.  This is my first review on a flower that deserves to be mentioned. I am also not using an alias as I  stand proudly behind my reviews. From the gate, you will know Emd means business.  Physical layout is gorgeous with heavy carpeted trichomes and fat condensed calyxes.  Smell is like a field of lemon trees planted on newly overturned s...”"
oceancrashing,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1360164,"“Tried this one for the first time last night and all I can say is WOW. It was excellent. Gave me a burst of happiness and calmness and then coming down I got pretty sleepy and managed to sleep through the night even though I have chronic insomnia. New favorite for the time being.”"
11Adam11,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1360166,"“Just a great relaxing high that doesn't keep you glued to the couch...unless you want to be. Still feel mentally sharp after smoking. Great for insomnia”"
take1ads,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1327994,"“By far the best I have ever smoked! The taste, the smell, the stickiness when you break it down. Dam! This weed is SEXY! I still break this down by hand just to feel it. The high is one that if you are already high on some coo then this will pass that right up and put you where you need to be. Hu! Then the way burns when you smoke it. I dont know about any of my other favorite that can compare to this. Love it! Wish ...”"
bestalex,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1360174,"“very unique cut of OG! The smell was dank, fuely and really citrusy very similar to OG, but the taste was lighter and more floral. As for the medical effects, this OG provided a very heavy body high and couchlock. Great for any indica fan who likes OG!”"
420capricorn420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1344239,"“Sweet smelling yet danky, tight nugs, great indica instant peace of mind, headache relief, & couchlock potential. Medical grade used to treat IBS & PTSD”"
CYN3RGY,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1360167,"“Outstanding strain. would definitely suggest for sleep.”"
Kushani,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1380347,"“Possibly one of my favorite Indica strains. I enjoy this after a long day of work. I'm on my feet all day and although it's not exactly a pain reliever it's a major relaxer and cradles you right to sleep after and happy and enjoyable high!”"
StLBudman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1519003,"“Holy smokes! This emerald gem put me in a perfectly euphoric state for 3 hours. My very favorite. From taste to smell to looks...I love this strain more and more each time I smoke it. My only complaint is no one ever seems to grow enough to sell in larger quantities than a gram. I'd pay above top dollar for an ounce of this!”"
VR0678,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1360169,"“Good strain and really makes you relax...the only thing is that this strain hits you later than sooner...so just give it a while and all of a sudden you'll be couch locked”"
StLBudman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1477769,"“OH MY!!! Only bought a gram and wish I would've gotten an ounce. Best I've had in a minute!”"

favorite strain.”"
dooobiedoo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1448629,"“Emerald Diesel x Fire OG
Much appreciated Indica affects - ideal for sleep aid, I'd suggest for headaches or body pain also. Quite relaxing and even euphoric.”"
ShoFire,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1360173,"“This is as strong as it gets, rolled a blunt and only got halfway before I realized I was glued to the screen for 10 minutes.”"
ironwave,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1482184,"“Got some shatter from the emerald cup. Very smooth and consistent vape. Easy cleans off the dab tool. Relaxed and calm.”"
MotaPrincesa,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1502716,"“First and foremost, Emerald OG smells like heaven. When I first got a hold of this strain I was floored with the smell. The first thing you'll notice is the citrus that, at least for me, was the dominant scent emanating from this strain. The earthy undertones really give this a sweet and aromatic flavor. Indicas are my personal favorite ways to medicate for my own depression/anxiety. The bud itself is absolutely beau...”"

douglashadtopoop,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1380228,"“Awesome pure luck find on 420. I came across an old bag of emerald I'd forgotten about, it was 2.3 grams and I rolled all of it into 2 zigzag 1 1/4s connected lengthwise and smoked about a third of it. Very mild, pure indica high, according to the label 24%thc but doesn't feel near that strong. It's difficult to review because the effects are so understated even after smoking a lot of it (and not smoking at all for a...”"
logan1993,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1153620,"“Emerald OG was an excellent indica. Emerald OG had me feeling relaxed right away, which turned into couch lock, and finally me falling asleep. If you have trouble with insomnia or just want to have a nice relaxing night time smoke before bed then Emerald OG is definitely for you.”"
1kushking,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1701813,"“Super dense buds made breaking it up by hand difficult. Light green on the outside with some faint purple also on the inside. Buds had 18% THC & super fine crystal trichomes. Taste & smell was a sweet earthy floral citrus. Results were happiness, relaxation, & sleepiness. Best for after your days work until you go to sleep. Good Night...”"

beautys1tragedy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1223819,"“This strain is smooooooth! damn!!! 💚
Seriously though, the fragrance of the buds was lovely! Took me back to the early days of smoking and the excitement that came from knowing you're about to burn a great bowl. The flavor is sweet and mildly eathy and hits super smooth. Fast acting and effective for relaxing at the end of the day. Will definitely be adding to my favorites and in future purchases.”"
CaroLeaN86,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1360168,"“Loud AF 

Very pretty colors and super pungent. 

Great For: Pain | Relaxing | Insomnia | Appetite Loss | Sleep |”"
Chimaera,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1360171,"“Got a gram of this very goopy, stretchy, tasty oil, practically taffy or pull and snap. Loaded a large dab's worth into my Evolve Plus and it sent me to flavor country. Deep rich earthiness with a slight pungent aspect, a slow body tingle crawled up my arms, back, and face. Deep shoulder and neck pains are but a memory but I do feel stronger orbital pressure around my eyes. Nothing unpleasant though!”"

wilsonrashad10,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1328095,"“I love the smell out the bag. It is smooth smoke, it is VERY relaxing, and will sneak up on you if you aren't too careful.”"
InfiniteDR3AMER,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1461255,"“I'm very finicky to cannabis and this was very light for me even. It was a body high for sure, had waves of heaviness and then they'd subside. Nothing cerebral for me. Not too pleased though with all of the hype that was surrounding it so that's why I gave it a 3 out of 5. The dispensary I went to said it was top shelf and to me it was just a normal little body buzz. If you are after just a nice, very chill body high...”"
ashjames,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1360165,"“There's not too much bad things I can say about this strain--except maybe the smoke is a bit thick, but most indicas are like that. I felt like I was in a different world and could only focus on one thing. Definitely a nighttime strain since I can barely keep my eyes open by the time its wearing off.”"
dwobbly,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1411164,"“This has become my favorite strain by far. It hits me quick relaxes me fast. I'm someone who moves a lot when I sleep and this strain knocks me out and I need that. Good stuff!”"

TheMetalHippie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1207606,"“Pretty, green buds with lots of trichomes. Really relaxing, helps a lot with headaches and going to sleep. Didn't notice any dry mouth or paranoia at all.”"
Abvchef,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1393125,"“If you want to obliterate your superego and ego and explore your id and all the suppressed emotions then this is gonna get you there. I used my vapor bong attachment with my Kvape on 420F and took a few really good hits. Only negative was I could not stay awake to watch 'Live by Night' which I guess was not that good anyway. I recommend this strain for sleep, pain, and introspection.”"

BearzyStarr,https://www.leafly.com/indica/emerald-og/reviews/1742633,"“Ehh. Had I happened upon this in WV or NC perhaps I would've considered it a A+ score. Unfortunately for Ms. Emerald OG, this is Colorado. Top 25 maybe.”"
