I felt like my blood sugar was low and my heart was beating really fast.  This same thing happened last night after I smoked a different sativa so i'm not sure if it's something going on with me or I am having this sort of reaction to sativa dominant strains.”"

Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-the-ripper/reviews/1175378,"“Jack the ripper is one of those creeper sativa strains, although its not lemon tasting more of the skunk taste and flavor for this one. It still has a nice warm an uplifting feel to it. It's great if you're a mess and can't seem to find a starting point. It has a golden memory feeling its like revisiting a wonderful place again there are memories that stick with us forever. Jack is great if you can't seem to open you...”"

nanadee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-the-ripper/reviews/1076623,"“It's unfortunate, but JTR does nothing for me. I have tried and tried to no avail. I will not be getting this strain again - EVER! I can't blame the dispensary for it, I'm just guessing it's not going to work for me and never will. Oh well, it's back to Durban Poison during the day from now on and Granddaddy Purple at night.”"

SydneyG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-the-ripper/reviews/1276373,"“The smell is good, not so strong that it permeates everything. Like the taste compared to other earthy strains but I did try the shake which may have something to do with it. The feeling is euphoric! Literally! Love the high it gives while also keeping me up and moving for day time activities.”"
