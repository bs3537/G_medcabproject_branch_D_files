cascadianmass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/eugene-cream/reviews/1330735,"“This is a strain I keep coming back to, due to its high pinene content. Eugene Cream is very Unique, with fantastic, large buds stinking of a lot of pine, some earth, and a little cheese on the tail end. The high is very heady, and I look forward to this fantastic strain every night that I am in possession of it.”"
