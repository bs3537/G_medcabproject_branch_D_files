The smell and taste of berries is sweet and yummy.  Not only a beautiful plant and flower, but a delicious smoke too.  Definitely 5 out of 5 stars!”"

The berry flavor is not as strong as a blueberry muffin, but with a god balance of high notes.  And it's pretty strong.  The growers say they won't grow it next year (maybe cause the flower isn't as dense as most stuff?) but I'm gonna let them they should.  Don Carlos is a perfect smoking flower.”"
