vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-krush/reviews/1369180,"“Almost 5 stars! Heavy and cerebral at the same time. Brilliant pain relief, and music's every nuance was delectable and thrilling. Supper was amazing. 

This stuff is pungent, so beware. Ona, air filter, and incense could not tame it's skunky wonderfulness,  and the vapor still reeked all the way downstairs.”"

Although it's mostly a head high, you can feel the relaxing effects of sativa streaming through your body as well. Only negatives I can give this strain would be the dry mouth and eyes but what strain doesn't necessarily give you any of that. Even after the first hit it has a very tea like smell and taste to it. I enjoyed this s...”"

Smell: Rich earthy soil mixed with laundry detergent. Very floral scented witha touch of balck licorice and grape Fanta.

Taste: pretty easy inhale with a semi harsh exhale. Light taste of a boquet of fresh cut sping flowers. 

Overall: Instant body high with a creeper to the head. I felt tingly and focuse...”"
