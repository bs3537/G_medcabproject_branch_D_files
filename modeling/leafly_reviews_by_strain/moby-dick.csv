Moby Dick
=============
CaptainAhab,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/moby-dick/reviews/1397760,"‚ÄúMoby Dick is an amazing Sativa hybrid.  MD contains THCV which give the high a magical psychedelic effect.  The high is strong and immediate.  Positive energies move through mind and body  and remain for hours.  However there is no jittery paranoia from the Sativa at all, just bliss.  The smell is one of toffee and vanilla.  The buds are big,, solid, and golden. MD test out as high as 24% THC.  It the closest cannabi...‚Äù"

twotwenty,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/moby-dick/reviews/1397761,"‚ÄúA wonderful strain. The bud that I received was very beautiful. it was a green almost blue with many yellow glands. The smoke is smooth and slight piney taste.

A great medication to de-stress and unwind. Put in a CD and kick it on the lazy boy. It Would put a grin on your face, and made me a tad bit giggly with extra medicating.

Over all A great strain that can get you there.‚Äù"

WestAmericans,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/moby-dick/reviews/1397762,"‚ÄúBeautifully euphoric. Very uplifting. Quick-hitting, and surprisingly focused without anxiety. This was my first "true" sativa, or at least the most sativa-ish hybrid I've experienced. I followed up with Hash Plant, which is about equal strength-wise in the other direction (pure indica) a few hours later and wound up wishing I'd just stuck with Moby Dick. Most creative strain I've come across as well.‚Äù"

rechard718,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/moby-dick/reviews/1397765,"‚ÄúI'm a bit of a lightweight and can get pretty high even off of high CBD strains,  so sativas usually get me pretty anxious.   This strain was different. There was a definite air of happiness and elation that came along with the high.  I laughed all night.  Smoking more only increases the euphoria on this one (for me at least, which is unusual).  At higher doses, there were some marked psychedelic effects, but they we...‚Äù"

Put about a half gram in the tea I made for Alex on 1/27 or 1/28 when she was sick. She reported it as very intoxicating.
