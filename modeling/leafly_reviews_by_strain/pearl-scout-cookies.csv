smirking Millennials who never experienced the joy of ELO's "Time" with a pair of Sennhesier HD 800 headphones and a brain fulla Chocolate Thai. Well, fuck them! You know

The Pearl Scout Cookies were at 28.8 percent THC and kept me high for several hours. Lemony spicy taste with a euphoric uplifting high that lasts a long long time. Really no downsides to this one.”"

Does the trick for just about anything you could want it for. Best enjoyed with some videogames (friends optional but recommended) and/or a nice warm bed with nice pillows and blankets so you can truly appreciate the depth of the amazing body buzz and drift off into a pleasant psychedelic trance as...”"

googlyelmo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pearl-scout-cookies/reviews/1315088,"“One of the best of the old-school, foundational strains, GSC in all its many forms is a 'go-to' bud. Meaning that it is always an intense head, with many delightful sensory and physical effects that vary (tingling is a favorite), a strong positive impact on my mood, and a nice, characteristic flavor in the bowl, like pastry or like GSC, you decide.

Pearl Scout Cookies (there should be such a badge!) is very cookie-i...”"

And the BHO is phenomenal”"

I was motivated to do things but unable to actually concentrate. I  smoked wayyy too much and actually got really bad anxiety. Hits super smooth though, none of that sore throat ish that comes with harsher strains. My BF was on a creative rampage and was being optimistic until I started having anxiety ...”"

Fireline does a great job with anything they produce. Idk if it was just the batch I got but it seemed it was a little over cured. This strain is still amazing and potent. Perfect for the heavy user!🔥💯”"

Life becomes better  and the shit you thought about or were worried about during the day. Just makes you laugh , you pretty much laugh it off.  It's a good hitting hybrid.

This is a beautiful strain. Large chunky buds with gorgeous hues of purplish-blue throughout, absolutely littered with trichomes. 
The aroma is strong, lending both pungent earthy notes as well as a light citrus. Notes of pine seem to also be present. Once broken down, these buds smell much more skunky and herbal.
The flavor is smooth on the in...”"
