It starts in the head, then radiates out through the rest of your body. The relaxation and euphoria are intense, bordering on psychedelic. Sends you right to Saturn. That old zepplin album sounds even better. A definite night time or later in the day strain. A bit strong, so beginners may want to use caution. The flower I got was grown by Secret Gar...”"

Tokes of C.T.H.A. are not for the light hearted, as this herb will knock you down and sit on your chest till you pass out into psychedelic dreams of flower children dancing naked through electric neon paisley fields. CTHA will blast the olfactory senses with heavy amounts of myrcene and limonene, leaving you sedated and at ease. A good toke of this will likely leave you immovable so plan ac...”"

 This is my go-to, good time indica. My job has long hours and it's hard to turn my mind off after a long day. This helps me chill, has a good flavor, and I don't have to smoke a ton of it.

It doesn't knock me out, but I don't know if I'd recommend it for lightweights. 

Secret Gardens of Washington is the...”"

Nice body high, a very nice strain for night time for me; but anyone else might wanna try it during the day 😀✌💨💨”"
OldToby214,https://www.leafly.com/indica/crouching-tiger-hidden-alien/reviews/1644483,"“Crouching Tiger Hidden Alien, more like "Crouching Tiger Hidden Gem." CTHA is a great strain with a name worthy of how strange the high feels. I have been looking forward to trying this strain for 3 years and it has finally fallen into my lap(insert evil laugh).
        CTHA has an aroma that reminds me of dark chocolate or cacao. I really enjoy the strong flowery and herbal tastes I get from this strain, they are ve...”"

Felt effects after on hit. Only use when going to stay home all day and relax, and sleep. Good for relieving stress too.”"
cheshirecat289,https://www.leafly.com/indica/crouching-tiger-hidden-alien/reviews/1345473,"“This is a strain that is very much Indica, especially from SGOW. The nose on the strain is pungent, almost like a sour yeastie bread. The flavor is pleasant and the effects are immediate.”"

TheLaBree,https://www.leafly.com/indica/crouching-tiger-hidden-alien/reviews/1212325,"“I found it took a while to feel the full effect and was quick to wear off. 
Decent stress relief as it did relax both mind and body.”"
