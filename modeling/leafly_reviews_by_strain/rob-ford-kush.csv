Very Pungent, chunky buds that give you an instant couch lock; with a side of the giggles. Taste like a strong kush,almost bubba but a lot stronger; with  candy-esk undertones.
 Good for insomnia, pain relief, and anxiety.”"

Extremely dense and caked buds with lovely purple protruding calyxes.. nature's beauty. Hits fast and hard smacking me in the face immediately. Good for appetite, stress, anxiety, sleep and pain. Some strong terpenes in this one, very pungeant penetrating skunky aroma. I would LOVE to have a mother of this strain .. my god. I would defin...”"

great heavy hitting strain, just like the Legend Ford himself and his one liners haha”"

Very lemony-hashy as well as this wood smell that seems somewhat unique.  Very relaxed but functional indica high. Good for night walks.”"

I smoked this before bed a few times but found that it didn't really make me tired, however it did relax my entire body and get rid of my daily work stresses... I can't wait to get my hands on this strain again, FORD MORE YEARS.”"
