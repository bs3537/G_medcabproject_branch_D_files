Since I started using Skywalker, I no longer need to pop a Xanax when I am feeling stressed-out (which is usually daily!). I take a couple good tokes of this and I'm good-to-go again! This stuff rocks!!!”"

Popular amongst Jedi smokers, this one really helps you connect with what surrounds us, penetrates us and binds us all together. On Tatooine this strain is referred to as "Power Converters" and can be picked up at the dispensary inside Toshi station. The Hookah Lounge in Mos Eisley sells it as a house brand. Very popular in Degobah.”"

It's taking off in Nor Cal and is sure to be a new trendy strain before long. Too bad clones are impossible to find… Although it's nothing special to look at, the high is intense. It's mostly cerebral and puts me in my "Happy" place. This is my favorite day-time strain right now.”"
