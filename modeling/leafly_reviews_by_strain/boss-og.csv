ErionEric,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-og/reviews/1562092,"“Let me tell you that’s the way to finish off a hectic 60+ hour work week. Stressed to the limits. Friday night, fire up a bowl of this, and I’m a totally different person. Stress? Nothin’. Such a nice little euphoric life saver. Get back to feeling relaxed and didn’t leave me with a huge appetite. A little too much on the dry mouth, but overall not a bad way to bring yourself back to you. Where you belong.”"

I like this strain a lot. It has a really nice hybrid balance with an initial head high followed by a relaxing & mellow high. It reminds me a little of GSC. I would definitely compare the two with the onset and initial buzz. I do notice that sometimes it makes my vision a little blurry but thats sometimes after not smoking all day.
All that said, it didn't leave enough of an impact on me to ...”"

Sorry for that but holy mother of yesssss. Finally a strain that list pain as the 1st sense of relief.

I can maybe only name 2 strains that can even stand up to this stuff those are probably grease monkey and maybe silver haze (maybe) I did not try ghost OG so that might take the top spot but I can say if ur able to get the “real” Boss OG... you already won it’s a power house knockout”"
BayNatureKing,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-og/reviews/1562667,"“Boss Og is Great for mid-day, afternoon and evening use. Or really perfect for a creative, lazy or productive morning. I think it helps for relaxation. I might nickname this (or my friend's version) CEO Og if there's not one yet.
Og strains typically strains leave me pleased and knowing what to expect. Some strains of OG seem to have unique full flavor or kick, this definitely being one of them.”"

Marcjon7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-og/reviews/1742744,"“It has a Musky smell to it I like it to be honest. The high is really intense and last long. I’ll say it’s one of my top 5. If someone has this get a lot because I will buy it all.”"

BlondeSavage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-og/reviews/1803100,"“Just got this from Trulieve yesterday. I am vaping the 600mg cartridge and just got it yesterday. The effects of Boss OG creep up on you. When I had one puff I waited awhile and felt like I might not have pulled much. Then I had a couple more and slowly the good feelings creeped in. It’s very subtle but I was feeling very depressed and like something was sitting on my chest. This strain lifted 3/4 of that weight off ...”"

For me, it is effective for reducing pain and inflammation, without feeling out of it.     I also find it helpful at treating headaches.  It has helped me A LOT with anxiety and depression as well, without feeling medicated.  It is very “balancing” for me, and it reduced my ibuprofen intake by ~90%.  This strain is currently in my top-3...”"

I always become more aware of these pains when I smoke anything, but in gentler, less nerve-wrecking ways. Still less than 5 puffs in now I feel like Boss OG will be the go-to for pain (as well as CBD) that I've been searching for. I was so surprised I kept saying "What...?" 😂 Would def...”"
