SeasideSuicide,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/citrus-punch/reviews/1381671,"“The smell certainly lives up to the name, but the high was nothing to write home about.  Lemon/citrus-scented buds generally do not agree with me, and this was no exception.  A true Sativa head high with mind-racing, heart-pounding effects that left me drained on the comedown.  Definitely not the worst Sativa I've ever smoked, but I wouldn't buy it again.  

I'd wager that Citrus Punch is rich in limonene based on th...”"

BigDabbyStrain,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/citrus-punch/reviews/1586181,"“This was my first go with full spectrum sugar and it was not the ride I was hoping for but I may have built it up with unreasonable and unrealistic expectations...taste was slightly more spicy than I would have liked especially for citrus punch. Underworld is one of the best distillate products out and their live resin/shatter is top notch also but there are other collectives I would pursue for crumble/sugar...anyway...”"
GeneralProper,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/citrus-punch/reviews/1562141,"“Citrus Punch is a great Sativa, went to the local shop got a 1/8 and the first bowl was so fresh and soothing, the effects are immediate and will give you a calming and uplifting state of mind. I didn’t get the creative vibe as other strains this is more calming and relax still able to have those creative thoughts but not as much as other Sativa’s. I would recommend this strain for social or just relaxing in the Hous...”"

Very positive high that I'd say is right the middle of feeling focused and sleepy. The taste just doesn't appeal to me. I tried the three settings on my vape and it always came across a bit rough. I find the taste really kills it for me. If you like a harsh citrus taste it might be for you.”"
VoodooIdol,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/citrus-punch/reviews/1711982,"“Another SATIVA ...this one is a CBD CONCENTRATE by TERRAPIN 41% CBD 21% THC.  A delightful flavor, smooth smoke, burns at a low temp so be careful,not to kill your terpene profile.
A few hits of this.and immediately I got that nice CLEAR HEAD,
And that feeling I lost 15 years off my body’s age!

I went to Terra Vida in Abington n after enjoying such Great RELIEF from Terrapin Lemon Sweet Skunk CBD Strain and bought u...”"

Pega,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/citrus-punch/reviews/1384421,"“Wow, this is a CRAAAAZY strain. When I saw the nugs I had I instantly put it to some photos. Needless to say, this is a very good strain. My body feels very relaxed. This is couch-lock weed. I could definitely reccomend this strain to people with stress, body pain, and headaches. Love this strain”"
