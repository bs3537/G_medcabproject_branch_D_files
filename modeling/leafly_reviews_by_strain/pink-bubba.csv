=============
Tkadz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1382776,"“Very potent, great for stress, insomnia and anxiety. It's one of my preferred indica strains. Beautiful nighttime use and aroma in the air!”"
Californiabuds,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1359092,"“This stuff comes on smoothly, at first you notice the gradually intensifying mind buzz, then comes the completely relaxing body stone and dreamy euphoria. Can be slightly psychedelic, this stuff will give you the munchies bad! you'll want to eat everything in sight but you will be too damn couch locked to do anything about it! 

Great for relaxing and listening to music, perfect for de-stressing and getting a comfy n...”"
mattny,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1368823,"“Very sweet, skunky, pungent floral smell. Heavy, penetrating terpenes make my mouth water. Very strong essential oils. The effect is extremely relaxed, carefree, good for sleep, decent for pain and appetite. I can really tell the different subtle elements of both strains within pink bubba. Meditative and medicinal comes on fast and hard creating a body melting feeling. Takes you right to the couch. Great nighttime he...”"
KyleFromVanIsle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1359094,"“I don't think it's wise to rate strains as 5 Stars but I think it's warranted when it comes to Pink Bubba. In fact, I'm not going to say much more because I read everyone else's reviews (by date) and basically the 5 or 6 most recent posts say it all! 

Awesome strain, so tasty, nice density, classic smells emanating from some very nice nuggets.

If you are lucky enough to find some fresh, properly flushed and cured P...”"
McSplif,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1507313,"“Epic smoke.  Earthy, piney, dank, dense, sticky.  Overall this strain is up there with the best.  Flavors are delicious.  Genetics are solid.  Piney sweet dankness that seems to amplify in flavor  the more u smoke.   Great strain to put the day to bed.   or simply to tolerate it. But like any strain though it comes down to the grow/flush/CURE.. When done properly this is top shelf.  Hypothetical..   Your  stuck on an...”"
z0ne,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1397065,"“So, among my favourite (Canadian spelling) strains are Bubba Kush (greatest flavour, in my opinion, almost mocha/coffee aftertaste in the mid to upper price range) and Pink Kush (Fastest acting pain relief, that I've found, but quite short lived and upper high price range). Combining these two creates a thing of beauty. The short lived aspect of the Pink Kush seems to be gone. While the Bubba flavour mixes so nicely ...”"
petethekoala,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1387010,"“What a great strain! Very powerful. Can be overwhelming for a beginner. Very complex set of taste dominated by it citrus and pine aroma.Perfect for long video game or LAN-party nights. Great smoke, what else can you ask in life!!! This thing is a powerful and will leave you stoned for a little while. Good to sleep too but I prefer this one for more relax activities.”"
smokinglionz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1359093,"“Really REALLY liked this strain. Great to wake and bake, wouldnt recommend doing so if you have stuff to do that day. Such a couch lock strain. Very mellow and relaxing. Recommend for older adults.”"
_vmini,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1359097,"“Love! Such an intense, warm, body-oriented high. Definitely euphoric - I'm basically smiling the entire high. Sit on the couch forever. Hella dry mouth.”"
JHolden87,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1362105,"“This is my favourite strain of all time. 

Overwhelming Kush smell.

The nugs are so dense and sticky they muck up my grinder. 

The smoke is so smooth and tasty - until it bites you, then you cough like a bitch. 

Oh my jesus. I'm on my ass for two hours after smoking a .6g joint to myself. Long time, nightly smoker for 14 years with a decent tolerance. 

If you see this strain, TRY IT!”"
amethystcannabis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1359095,"“smells lovely, with a small hint of citrus and a light pine base flavor. heavy indica, with a feeling of weight over your eyes, this will make you VERY tired. wonderful strain to help you relax after a busy day at work!”"
mikeyakafranky,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1248268,"“Really nice strain. Smooth, tasty, and stinky. Really good for pain, stress, depression, muscle spasms, insomnia, and headaches. I”"
Sheemer17,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1505231,"“I’m in love with the scent of this one. Definitely one of my favourites scent wise. It’s definitely a before bed weed. Deep relaxation and sleepiness with this one.”"
VanIslandCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1337460,"“Pink Bubba looks exactly like pink kush, except the bubba gives Pink Bubba more resin and crystal on its buds. The taste is hash and earthy fruit; effects are long lasting and consistently relaxing. Works nicely when rolled into joints.”"
crudemood,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1595056,"“This strain was awesome.  At first I was happy and giggly and then the indica couch lock set in. I'm still a novice smoker but I had 5 puffs and was high for a long time.  I'm sensitive to paranoia when it comes to weed and this one did not at all induce paranoia.  Great strain would recommend it!”"
mkbergen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1346260,"“Feelings of relaxation with minimal cognitive activity. Body feels relaxed without increased psychological activity, good for a night in vegging out. Does not leave you feeling hazy even though there's reduced psychological stimulation.”"

LogicInYoUrFace,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1642633,"“Amazing for a burst of creativity, motivation and brain energy to do and try new stuff.

 Decrementally slows down your body and mind after ~2 hours in my case.
Very hard to concentrate, music affects a lot on the HigH.

Doesn't make me very hungry, but looking for something to do, hard to close my eyes because of boredom.

Feels tired like I had a long day, kinda like mind fatigue and a little body fatigue than slee...”"
905backwoods,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1605469,"“One of the best strains I have tried in awhile! Very tight nugs covered in trichomes, paired with a dank kushy/fruity smell. Leave a heavy indica high and would highly recommend at the price point!”"

This is a Hybrid cross one of top 10! Pink & Bubba!”"

DualMerlin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1346936,"“Great evening strain. Strong body high, but leaves you with enough energy to be social unlike other powerful indicas. Best used as an evening strain (post work, etc.). Enjoy!”"

This is one of my favs I keep coming back to.  Unlike Bruce Banner that makes me the Energizer Bunny, Grady leaves me melted into my couch so I use as nighttime vapour.  Nice taste & awesome pain reliever.”"

JoshLoc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1303719,"“I like this strain a lot!  I could smoke this all day every day. There is some burn out and I wouldn't recommend unless your a regular smoker. I find this to be a lot like OG but on steroids. Just beautiful stuff”"

Indicaem,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1266980,"“I havent been a big fan of anything with the pink strain genetics but tried this at the recommendation of a budtender.   The bud tastes earthy and piney with sweet, flowery undertones.   This strain caused no body-melting or couch lock and I found it overall, too euphoric and uplifting for me.   This is a strain for the daytime for sure.”"
TheBurnt,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1293855,"“Very nice strain, potent and fairly tasty. Great puff for before bed, or late night couch activities! Would not recommend for the day time, too sleepy and snacky!”"
Indicaem,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1298440,"“This is an earthy strain with a flowery sweetness and undertone of pine.   This is a heavy indica strain that I use to assist with insomnia at night.  The high relaxes my body making it so light that I could float away.  I normally fall asleep on the couch with this one, I never make it to my bed.”"

sikala,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1367818,"“Not too bad, i found the smoke a little harsh then was just day as normal with a little fuzz on the corners. not really too heavy or cloudy, no couchlock was nice for the daytime

I find it helps lessen pain by a 1/2 count in the 1-10 pain scale (I usually sit on a 8 count)”"
CrazedTre,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1255391,"“I just tried it twice in my whole life, the first batch was awesome uplifting high the second batch I got was very hybrid like but still this is high quality anywhere you get it.”"
ghosttropics,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1266413,"“the body high is out of this world, as well as a beautifully dreamy head high that comes on slowly.. an all around comforting and peaceful night time high. not to mention it seems to consistently produce huge amounts of of vapour. unfortunately though, i find it does not help much with my insomnia”"
omgitsrhirhi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1365215,"“Pink Bubba has been one of the stronger strains I've tried and loved. I found myself feeling very euphoric and relaxed, however, most of the time it was to the point of exhaustion. I found myself taking an excessive amount of non-intentional naps every night when smoking throughout the day. Perfect for an evening wind-down or weekend hangout. Not good for keef production.”"

Sexyfit420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1385012,"“Once again, ive tried various indica strains to help me sleep. This one wasnt bad but was not strong enough for me. Ive been a regular user, pipe smoker, for a year.

So my reviews don't match others who get great pain relief and sleep from indica dominants.

I dont. This one tasted fine but did not give me a high at all. Relaxing pain relief for me. Will not buy again.”"
Carybear,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-bubba/reviews/1579388,"“This strain is just although I doubt it's a pure indica.Bit of a spacey buzz, really dull my senses. It feels a bit heavy on the head, possible headache”"
