But the taste of citrus and hints of flowery niceness. Almost has a sweetness to it as well. And some other herbal after favors that slowly creep in after exhale!. And the medical and even recreational effects are beyond amazing I would recommend this to anyone with pain issues because the pain relief of this strain is beyond oxycodone even. Th...”"

I am also totally pain free for the first time in days! I will be buying more ASAP!”"

Looks frosty great. Shades of light green, blues, purples, and the shades of pink. Name sakes there by the look. Aroma is unique and makes a pothead do a double smell. It’s like potpourri. Spicy flowers and hints dried dark fruit. Even a rubbery plastic in the mix too. Tastes like dried fruit and flowers. Effects are great for night time I felt like a ha...”"
Malkavianmanda,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-panties/reviews/1718094,"“Pink panties is a really flowery smoke with a decent, relaxing high, perfect for winding down. It does give me a slight headache though, which I assume is blood pressure fluctuations. Overall, I would recommend it!”"

Davidpnin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-panties/reviews/1682239,"“It feels like I could read the dictionary on this or jerk off and sleep.  It has a very floral and fruity smell and it smokes like velvet.  Numbs me up good and keeps me mentally relaxed by mildly stimulated.  I recommend for Indica lovers.”"
