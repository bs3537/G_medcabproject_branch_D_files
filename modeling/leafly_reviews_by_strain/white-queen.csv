Shilligoss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1337746,"“Amazing pot. White Queen is a hybrid of White Widow and Afghan Kush. The highest T.H.C. percentage of any strain. Nice fruity smell.”"
Oberlord,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1061921,"“God save the Queen.
The first rip was very earthy with a citrus kick, after which I realized what leafly meant when they warned: "not for beginners," when it comes to White Queen. This stuff with give you a very sophisticated high, conversational at times with a calm stress reviler in the back of your mind. Good flavor, the potency is clearly over 20% maybe even over 23%. Enjoy.”"
dudethebagman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1356694,"“This strain really does just eliminate stress. it's one of the most euphoric strains I've ever had. I've been smoking exotic high-grade cannabis for over a decade and the balance of this hybrid is absolutely perfect in my opinion though your mileage may vary depending on the grower and your own personal body chemistry.  id say if you're one of those people thats stressed out all the time, constantly under the gun try...”"

Kaliskunk28,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1262874,"“This is one of the best cannabis strain known to man kind.
The smell off these beauties is second to none...Very very sweet and acidic and oak scented...Like white wine.

Amazing ! ! !

The buds look very Indica and smoke like a Sativa...
Very similar to Snow White; however, this one is SO fruity smelling...The taste is very "OG-like" and a hint of spicy cedar/cinnamon...I would have called it White Sangria, but Whit...”"
aliceinwonderland17,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1357769,"“I really love this strain. No headache, no heavy sedation but just enough to feel the high throughout the body. Some energetic bursts but still feel relaxed and euphoric. Would recommend for a daytime smoke or an early evening, stress and depression buster. Definitely getting some more!!”"

Well, it's honestly amazing. It relieves me of my stress 100% after work as well as helping me sleep without that heavy indica feeling the next day. I strongly recommend this for anyone who loves a great saliva.”"

HighFunctional,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1167022,"“Damn! Sticky flowers have a sweet, fruity, herbal aroma. Taste when vaping is like raw sugar and leaves, with fruity and dank herbal notes. Strong buzzy high, with moderate body stone.  Probably closer to a 4.5 out of 5”"
BaronOfBud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1191233,"“Exclusive strain, extremely potent sativa hybrid effects , hard to find... Only one place in LA has it on the top shelf. One of my favs”"
hailSeitan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1333054,"“Holy shit. Amazing weed. This gets you really baked, just so much of a buzz in the head and at the same time so relaxed, dreamy, and makes you feel at peace. A veritable connoisseur strain!”"
sugareeme,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1061774,"“One of my favorites. Definitely potent and relaxes your body immediately after your first hit. Though, not the best to smoke before class; at least for me. I became very fatigued as it wore off, more so than with other strains. A great intense and happy high!”"
ToastedPineapple80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1568620,"“Smells really good. I didn't enjoy it like i did the white widow. But I was feeling ok.”"
Eastcoastgrowguy413,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1561439,"“Well rounded. Comes with an intense high that last a long time if grown right. Smell is awesome. Plant likes the lights a little bit farther away than most. I was displeased by how fluffy the buds were but I suppose that could be in result of the way I grow. All considering it’s an awesome straight, covers I crystals, and packs a punch.”"
crownBud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1231370,"“To me White Queen has the best flavor and smell in any cannabis ever smoked, leaves me hungry and uplifted, definitely a day time bud”"
Cloudgoddess1111,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1731406,"“I enjoyed this strain during the night time. It really helped me relax and fall asleep. I actually fell asleep while smoking it ( i know that sounds dangerous but the joint quickly went out) and so did I. I like the purps in this strain. Good for insomnia, anxiety and gastrointestinal problems. Enjoy the Queen!”"
EdenMaine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-queen/reviews/1430483,"“This strain is definitely a very smooth and long lasting effect.
It has a very strong aroma before you even open the bag you know its going to be good. Mood elevating and enhances social 
interaction in addition to strong good pain relief. Top notch for sure.”"
