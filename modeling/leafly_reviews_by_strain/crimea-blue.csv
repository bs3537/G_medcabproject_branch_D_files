antennae,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crimea-blue/reviews/1062592,"“Crimea Blue has a lovely blueberry-esque scent and flavor making it a great choice for those who appreciate fruity strains.

This is one of my go-to strains for dealing with insomnia.  It's also good for appetite enhancement.  I find it very relaxing with a nice body effect.  There are few if any negative side effects.

Overall this is a pleasant, effective strain.  It seems to have all the positives and none of ...”"

Nice Steady oncoming high that lasts and lasts without any noticable negative side affects oddly enough except feeling almost none if any pain for once which is so awesome to someone in constant pain like me and makes me calm, happy, euphoric a little, and very talkative. (After 1 joint felt great for almost 3 hrs. and spent ...”"

It was a creeper when vaped, that hit full tilt while grocery shopping (last hour of X-mas eve). Any medication that can make that fun is excellent by me. Unfortunately, the first two hours were spent wandering the store, laughing at the roasts and homemade rolls......with mind numbing bliss. PERFECT STOCKING STUFFER...”"

A small bit will get you going, but you may over toke just to taste it again.  Then it twists a bit and you feel tingly but almost nomal until you try to do something.  Almost a lucid alcohol drunk.  Odd but nice.  Pains are less and your ok with that.  Cool!”"

Think awake and lucid but almost drunk feeling when it comes to body movements.  But... its fun.. and kills the aches and pains.  Very unique buzz, Love it.  Should be good with that special someone in bed.”"

softbullets,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crimea-blue/reviews/1162570,"“Wonderful body high. Slightly sedative while the body tingles and waves of relaxing warmth flows through the body.”"
HairyPotter,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crimea-blue/reviews/1148571,"“Very relaxing strain, great for nighttime smokage or vaporizing. Helps me release nervous tension. 

One of my favorite strains to grow and vaporize. It is a nice compact plant with beautiful trichome production. Similar in taste and effects to Pot of Gold, with a pleasant berry/cream taste.”"
tmctomas,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crimea-blue/reviews/1062582,"“A very nice strain, quite a strong smelling one. The soft dense buds grind perfectly and release a strong citrus like aroma which can be tasted in the inhale as a sweet lemon/raspberry flavour.
Quite potent in large amounts, however it's a good high and not an 'overload' sensation.”"

MrPillsbury,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crimea-blue/reviews/1219794,"“Just got an 8th of this "golden" bud goodness and I must say, she is very relaxing! Nice cerebral head high after a couple puffs with a body high right after that packs a punch. The taste I must say is just delicious! As a lover of diesel/sour tasting strains it's nice to experience something much less harsh tasting but still very scrumptious”"

m0rb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crimea-blue/reviews/1535785,"“This strain is one of the few, they are giving to German cannabis patients as "Red No 4".

At first, I absolutely HATED this ggtaste!
Leafly says "Berry, Tea and Blueberry", but all I could smell was, MOLD, PAIN and DEATH!
After I sampled it, I had to take another taste and another and another...now, I can even smell, at least, a very general Berry-esque-ness!

Crimea Blue has become my go-to "go to bed" strain; afte...”"

blazindavid420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crimea-blue/reviews/1555735,"“Just got and OZ of this stuff.. wow... definitely similar to blue dream. The thing that stands out the most to me is how long the peak lasts for. It’s unbelievable. The high hits immediately on the second toke and continues to rise for about 29 minutes until it peaks, than the peak lasts about 2-3 hours. Next time it is on the market I will be getting more.”"
Lucyparker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crimea-blue/reviews/1516858,"“One of my top ten. This tastes incredible.  Normally I go for lemon or pine so I was nicely suprised at how much I enjoyed it.

Blueberry taste, just wonderful. The high was just as nice...to be honest,  I don't really remember the high, so I guess it was good. ;)  I was so focused on the yumminess.

I found this in DC recently, if you see it,.grab it.”"
