Skunkberry
=============
OldToby214,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1411960,"“This is one of my favorite hybrids. The blueberry attributes are very prevalent, Skunkberry has a great relaxing feeling and definitely helps with any pain you may have, and it does not make you feel too sleepy. It's a great after workout smoke. I really enjoy smoking this at the end of the day as a precursor to smoking before bed. It has an amazing body and head high. Kinda like being bathed solar radiation.”"
teezytreezy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1411959,"“The smell of Skunk Berry is wonderfully berryful. I myself am a pretty big fan of Blueberry, make this strain already interesting to me. When I got my batch of Skunk Berry I did notice that it did seem like a rather plain strain & had no real extraordinary appeal to the look of it, however the smell conquers the stoners nose with an overwhelming berry aroma.  It's berry nice. The high is very mellow and happy going. ...”"
MabtheKing,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1411956,"“This strain has a mild euphoria accompanied by a head high that slowly gathers intensity and evens out as you continue to smoke. It's is not harsh on the lungs and although the body high isn't intense it will gradually creeps up on you, you'll feel your chest as if it were lighter and your muscles throughout your legs loosen and stretch out comfortably. With little to know paranoia this strain would be good for exerc...”"
brooklynbaby,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1411958,"“I really enjoyed this super mellow, deliciously smelly strain. You can really smell the skunk and the blueberry, and the taste of the smoke is pure blue cheese. The effects are not horribly strong but still quite enjoyable. I think this would be a good strain for a mellow outdoor activity, like a picnic in the mountains or something equally lazy.”"
BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1411957,"“This review is on Skunkberry sugar wax by Craft. C.O. 

The terp profile on this strain is beautiful.  It's rare that wax has this strong of an odor, but fresh blueberry and you guessed it skunk fills the room when it's left opened.  What really threw me off about this strain was I expected a much stronger emphasis on the sativa genetics while this strain was very much indica dominant.  2/3 times dabbing this it flat...”"

Best tasting strain I've ever tried for our generation, I'm 23 and I've been timing about 8 years now to whom it may concern, and this tops over blueberry alone, lemon, mango, all of it, it's a sweet berry taste with beautiful average to small size crystal covered buds, Whenever and where ever the time you'd crack your top, you're bound to see a cartoon skun...”"

deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1383989,"“🥀🧀 Skunkberry is quite possibly the most appropriately named strain ever. It smells exactly like it's name. Perfect mix of 'skunk' and 'berry'. This delicious hybrid offers a very uplifting and relaxing effects. Smooth on the inhale, this strain is an all around treat. This strain will not ruin your day by any means, but will allow you to coast on cruise control all day with a smile on your face. I love this strain...”"

1kushking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1742806,"“This multiple award winning Hybrid had 20% THC. The smell & taste was pungent but, a beautiful berry/blueberry with skunk. Hard buds, hunter green in color with light brown pistils. Buds covered in fine white hairs & trichomes. Effects were uplifted, happy, & relaxed. No extreme up/down effects with this Hybrid, it is pretty level not taking me to high or to low. My strain was by Bloom Flowers.....Happy Sedation :)”"
TophitotheGreat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1623949,"“This strain is amazing for keeping you in that happy median, utilizing the terpenes for a nice relaxing high with the Blueberry and then that gasey undertone to raise your cognoscente being from Skunk, this hybrid will keep you from building too much of a tolerance. Hybrids are great for this effect as your body will become complacent with the effects from a straight indica or a straight sativa. Remember variety is t...”"
garneroutlaw,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1650895,"“Not my cup of tea. This is a thinking man's strain. I really enjoy relaxing, psychedelic strains the most and this strain actually hyped me up a bit. I don't smoke in the day, but this would be a really good strain to choose if you chose to. For now it is going on the back shelf.”"

ChefRamz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1500378,"“Soft mellow strain not as strong. The kind of strain that eases you in without a bang. Complete pain removal. Munchies to be expected quite the strain to  smoke and watch tv.”"

YaMon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1333050,"“By far the best smelling strain I ever smelt. Fresh blueberry pie out of the oven. Nice and strong while well balanced. Long lasting. Will be a favorite for a long time.”"
UnusualVandal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1365959,"“Amazing way to ease stress when going through tough times. Also awesome bud tenders and service at iliff and Buckley lightshade labs.”"
N8tiveCOKush303,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1291554,"“This bud is too bomb!! It smells like a fresh batch of grape blueberry lollipops and tastes just as great! The high isn't too heavy, but my eyes were so low my eyelashes were blocking my view lol”"
simon.castillo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1331454,"“A favorite of mine, the combination of the skunk and blueberry smells refuses to be ignored. Tried wax form, by way of EndoCanna (wax), from Karmacueticals out of Denver! Stop by if you're ever in Denver you will be impressed. Overall, I feel a great energy from the high and diminishing joint pain”"
Kan-knob-bus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1415271,"“A must try for anyone who enjoys a great mellow high and really helps relieve my pain from arthritis. Tastes fabulous and smells great. The berry flavor really comes thru during exhale and lingers on your taste buds for sometime after. Awesome strain”"
Dymik,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1336967,"“AMAZING SCENT AND TERP PROFILE. My review is based on the Skunkberry flower. The name matches the taste just as well as it does the pungent smell. Other fruit strands fall WAY short of Skunkberry, as it truely delivers the flavors and aroma suggested by the name, but in a potency unexpected by the user. I usually dont do reviews but this strain has inspired me and I am proud to call it my new favorite.”"
TopSarge,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1509915,"“So my lovely wife and I made a recent trip to Vegas and one of our first stops was Essence Dispensary. We were looking for a couple indica leaning prerolls to sample during our week-long stay and Michelle recommended this as well as King Louis VIII.
We took her advise and went with her recommendations. Our King Louis VIII review will come at a later date.
The aroma from the Skunkberry was just as one would imagine......”"
Senjiixing,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1647784,"“This one is great at lifting the mood as much as relieving stress & pain.
I found it particularly good after a hard day of dragging like a ball and chain was attached to both legs. Very uplifting.
I enjoy it best laying down.”"

Very swell taste he has!! I haven't really reached my state of totally relaxation yet since my stay here in this beautiful state until I took the time to enjoy a pre-rolled Skunkberry. WOW! I love it. It's incredibly relaxing. Great buzz! I'm thankful I trusted my bud-tender!!! Thanks man!...”"

BurnSlo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1364937,"“Fantastic taste the skunk makes this so  smooth through the inhale and exhale it's pretty ridiculous how smooth actually. Blueberry muffins after taste.

Once the bag is unlocked it's smells like a skunk ate a bushel of blueberries and 💩. Then sealed it. But the more appetizing version.

Great for ending the day off or accomplishing something.”"
casual_vegas99,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1502543,"“Hands down, one of my favorite strains.  Every visit to Jardin includes an 1/8th of this as long as it is available.  NC makes the one I vape and the berry is strong with the force in this one.  Rare out of my volcano this one hits almost immediately at 375 and I just stick to that through 4-5 easy bags.  On the first bag you feel heavy body sensations, tingling and euphoric giddiness.  Heavy skunk background on the ...”"
StLBudman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1569542,"“Definitely taste the blueberry in this one. Picked up a couple 1/8s from Lightshade in Denver yesterday. Not the most potent strain, but a decent head high. The taste and smell alone make it worth the purchase. Glad I tried it.”"
N8tiveCOKush303,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunkberry/reviews/1340587,"“The fruity stank on this bud is one of the very first noticeable characteristics you will encounter, and may even be the reason for choosing this strain. Skunkberry is very inquisitive as it tends to bring out your inner astrologer with a creative head high that can be very enlightening. With that being said, I do believe this same head high can have opposite negative effects for those who may be depressed or just ge...”"
