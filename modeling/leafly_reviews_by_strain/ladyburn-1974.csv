tom11,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ladyburn-1974/reviews/1657549,"“At first i'm pretty clear headed for a few minutes. When it really hits, it makes me stoned for another 30 minutes, than I find everything pretty funny (even when I'm all alone) for an hour or more. Than it makes me hungry.
Smell is not that good, but not bad at all. 
Still a 5 for it's effect.”"
