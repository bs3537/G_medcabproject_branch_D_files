rubiconbill,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1410538,"“Gumbo is my favorite night time strain. It tastes AMAZING and leaves me totally relaxed. It is a great pain management strain and very good for sleep. My only problem with this strain is it makes me want to consume mass quantities of junk food!”"
HungrymaN,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1412124,"“Bought a quarter of this and still enjoying it, a little goes a long way. Nice and strong strain, definitely best to use this when you're done for the day. Will keep you relaxed in place with a light couch lock. Great vaporized, high kicks in within a minute and comes in waves of happiness and warmth. Very good strain, anyone with the chance should try it! Gonna grind up another round now to enjoy!!!”"
bonzaisuperstar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1412125,"“This is a great non heady Indica.  Really low THC levels at a little over 6% but the CBD count is over 20%.  This accounts for the heavy body high and relaxation which make this a great medicinal bud.  Gives that "narcotic effect" people talk about when referring to strains as this is predominately body_centric.  Thumbs up on this one even though I won't be want to get out of bed in the morning.”"
steelcrazy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1371591,"“Great strain.  One of my favorites.  I don't know who is saying that paranoia and anxiety are side effects, because I'm usually asleep within 20 minutes of smoking this.”"
AndreaN,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1371592,"“This is from Silver Sage Wellness - 
THCA- 20.8  CBD- n/t 
Got some big firm nugs, but I think it's a bit dryer than it should be ..... I absolutely hate   That they package good medical flower in these stupid ziplock Baggie type things - WISH everyone in NV packaged like Polaris, & GLP 😬 
Anyhow - the flavor of this Gumbo is odd - I'm thinking it must be a "diesel" type flavor... But I could be wrong 😆!! 
It's a d...”"
garriswh,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1342631,"“Tasty, super relaxing strain that's great for nighttime use. Potent indica effect and bubblegum flavor are awesome for winding down before bedtime. Super effective for me with insomnia issues as well as pain.”"
lollipop1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1410541,"“I love this strain (name changed to Gumbi at The Farm) however I find it odd that people say it makes them sleep. This strain does the opposite to me. I can't sit still and I'm energetic and without pain at all -which is great. There's also no psychoactive effects on me. I do however have a hard time taking the smoke, it's harsh, it's really smelly and I go through it very fast.”"
GravyJ,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1321588,"“I smoked a pre-roll of Gumbo and immediately notice that classic dank-smell. The draw is smoother than a Lincoln drives and the high is somewhat sneaky! After I finished the pre-roll I played a bass solo for about ten minutes-  on my classical guitar. The introspective yield from Gumbo seems extremely third-eye sighted. After I channeled a little Larry Graham through nylon strings, I immediately started on The Dinner...”"

420Autoimmuner,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1062772,"“Medically, Gumbo is good for symptoms up to moderate range.  It does take a few minutes for the effects to set in, but my body has warmed up and I am starting to relax.   Some of my nerve issies have settled down, and my mind is quieting.”"
DoubleDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1413794,"“YUMMMMMBO!! This is an awesome Indica! It's pleasantly potent and well suited for nigh-time use, or an overall mellow, almost pain free day. Fantastic sweet and pungent aroma equals the extremely wonderful intoxicating/medical  benefits of this relaxing strain! Well done to the breeders! I tried both the 25% flowers, and the 75.5% concentrate; and I am a lucky man for it!”"
copperrunner,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1334147,"“Nice, calming body high.”"
Strainge,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1319609,"“Nice, level high that put me to sleep quickly and easily.  Taste had an almost perfume/cologne flavor, something I've not encountered before.”"
aliceisalive,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1339625,"“This strain pleasantly surprised me! Not only is it fabulous for Neurological pain due to Multiple Sclerosis, its ability to take stress away is amazing! It is not often that I find such a powerful strain. Great for evening or mixed with a more uplifting strain for daytime. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️”"
mookie13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1282138,"“excellent nighttime strain, almost a sedative type effect, great vape.”"
bosieboy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1210351,"“AWESOME night time strain. You will feel NOTHING!”"
HairKnife,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1412126,"“The flower and oil experience is 1:1. This is one of my favorite indicas, which tastes fairly decent in oil, just a tad thicker and darker.  Indicas have always been vampiry in my head, so this is basically the clove of 2016-2017.”"
Straponhoney69,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1412123,"“The best Pain reliever at all time. Get the  400mg cartridge.”"
mookie13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1412127,"“very nice bubble gummy flavor. great for nighttime use, almost a sedative type effect. knocked out a good amount of pain and let me sleep like a baby. would definitely buy again, big fan of the co2 oil.”"
flameflyer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1062773,"“Very tasty and great pain relief, I have also tried Gumbo Pop, which is a strain with a twist in its genetics.  I found  both at Yueba Buena. Both are really great, and for some reason, hit me really hard and great to smell.”"
AndreaN,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1354038,"“Gumbo'd again 😄👌🏼 after some introspective thought on the Gumbo , I am updating my review from 1 month ago .
I still think the flavor is a bit WONKEY 😜 but this is a GREAT nighttime medicine for me 😊👌🏼 
Would definitely buy again & again 😄👍🏼 
Have actually started using Gumbo ( gumbo'd ) as a descriptive word 😂😂😂 that Kush had me feeling GUMBO'D !”"
chicagopatient,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1583959,"“Cresco has improved their oil tank and moved away from the plastic wick tanks that they started with. The new style cartridge is excellent. Gumbo is a heavy indica that gives a great heady buzz with a relaxing sensation for the body. I have not had any Cresco oil products for several months, and I am happy to see that the quality, flavor, and potency of the oil is still excellent. The flavor is piney with an herbal f...”"

TwinkleToes2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1321589,"“love Gumbo!! Oil pen gives me the night time feeling. The right amount of great feeling, head high & fast acting.”"
Trippy-Bitch.27,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1701065,"“It is a stupendous strain rich with indica with lavishing trichomes. Its high is relaxing, elucidating, and free wheeling. Gumbo has a unique personality that is far from bland; a high that forces one to take a step back and enjoy the senses transcending one's expectations. Great for stress relief and period cramps.”"
jharold,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1606156,"“The Gumbo is great for calming and relaxing.  Doesn't take much to make me feel at ease.  I've used it in the afternoon and still felt like I could easily interact with others socially, and also have used before bed for a nice sleep.”"

okcarcane,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1279388,"“Great taste, very flavorful, really chill high, doesn't make me sleep, i become very active, not so much hungry it actually made me less hungry. but worth a try for sure.”"

SinisterSioux,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1642655,"“I thought I had favorites until I tried gumbo. Gumbo is by far the best sleepy time strain I've had.”"

A dab of the shatter and bye bye symptoms! I've tasted some really great shatters through SST and the Gumbo is right there between the OG Kush and the White Widow. So smooth and no bho taste, Killer!

megfish1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gumbo/reviews/1272346,"“Really great for sleep. I was able to drop sleep meds and ibd cramp meds and finally get a full nights rest! The high cbd has really helped with joint, eye, and intestinal inflammation!”"
