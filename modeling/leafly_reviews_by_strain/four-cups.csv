Long story short, this insanely dank strain is a bonafide win across the board. An honest hybrid that provides an remarkable body and mind high. But for those that like toking a few before a workout, it's a pre-workout miracle. Eliminates pain entirely so all that's left is the incredible focus you have on your almost primal mind-body connection. Just do it, as they say. You won't regret it.”"

Energizing & Pretty clear headed at moderate doses, yet not racy. Great for creativity and deep lateral thinking. Always lifts the spirits and makes me giggly. Wish it was more widely available !”"
