privatebong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pokie/reviews/1372226,"“Bought in Trinidad, CO this month. Wanted something that would help me relax, but would not loose physical productivity. It was on sale for something silly like ~ 100 a half.

I have tried smaller amounts 3x. Did not care for it out of a pipe, love it out of a bong. Smells, looks, tastes like that stuff from high school 25 years ago.

I like it, it's like a more awake version of afghani, could totally smoke this and ...”"

The harvest must have been perfectly timed, no negative effects what so ever. My artistic ability and relativity was enhanced greatly while enjoying the sensation which Pokie provided me. 

The bud itself is beautiful, I got a single 2 gram nug. The dark purples, bright greens, and oranges really made this marij...”"

bmoney808,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pokie/reviews/1223127,"“Wow where to start. This strain is by far the most strange I've had in a while. It is supposedly an indica but it makes me feel like I've taken 2 adderalls and a bowl. Not for those looking for anxiety relief. Won't get this strain again. Uncomfortably energetic. Starts off very dizzy.”"
HSTHitsquad,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pokie/reviews/1372225,"“The nugs are nice tight, and dense. The color is beautiful, I'm a sucker for purple on weed, tokes and burns well. Shouts out to the farm for having straight 🔥🔥🔥”"
eymacassi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pokie/reviews/1372224,"“To begin: the flower was dense, dark green and purple, and loaded with crystals and lil burnt orange hairs. I ended up landing on this strain because I was looking for a versitile indica and this smelled amazing. Very fruity and yummy! Almost like a really fruity hard candy. I had this strain recommended to me before, but I ended up picking something else so I figured I'd finally try it. I packed a bowl in my bubbler...”"
Biophilia1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pokie/reviews/1490729,"“As a shatter, this strain really creeps up on you. My advise is to take it slow when dabbing. One can become easily fooled into thinking they need to take another dab but, my advise would be to just wait about 10 minutes. Especially if you already took a decent size dab. I find myself getting higher than I need to be with this strain which is fun but a bit debilitating when I have some adulting that needs to get done...”"
tokeysmoker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pokie/reviews/1372223,"“Got a fresh batch of pokie from the farm and it is great night time medicine. Nice fluffy frosty nugs with beautiful green orange and purple hues. Smells like kush and candy. strong couch lock relaxing effects. I would definitely recommend this strain for people suffering from insomnia, anxiety, and muscle pain. We vaped it, watched cartoons and laughed like there wasn't a problem in the world followed by a great nig...”"
Robjetjet,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pokie/reviews/1372222,"“Pokie has been one of my more recent favorites. The buds themselves are amazingly dense and covered in trichomes. The high is nice and long lasting. Very smooth taste. Light color with purple highlights very beautiful bud.”"

Sir-smoke-alot-420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pokie/reviews/1292341,"“this strain is amazing not sure where these ppl are getting there bud but the bud I had was awesome! the buds had 24% THC and it provided a great high along with a great taste and smell 👍😆✌”"
ruedee11,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pokie/reviews/1243782,"“Of all the strains I've tried this is the worst one. Completely agree with another person about feeling like you popped a couple adderalls and then smoked a bowl despite it being an indica. No bueno.”"
GreenPie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pokie/reviews/1249284,"“Lame strain. Been using pot for pain as I had a pretty epic fall last summer. This Indica just didn't seem to work and I ate 5 x 10mg pieces all at once. A whole tube of Julie's Granola. I have another tube with another 50mg and I wish I could return it. Only effect I felt was restless legs, I just couldn't get to sleep because I wanted to move my body, particularly legs. I ended up having to take some Dr. J's PM Hea...”"
Forealcupcake,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pokie/reviews/1222888,"“Wasn't that bad at all, coming from someone who hates the taste of herb it was really not bad. It gave me a really good body high without the feeling of being clouded so I couldn't do much. Out of everything I've smoked this is in my top 5.”"
