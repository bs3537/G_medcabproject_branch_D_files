I have had some amazing spiritual epiphanies while under her gentle influence, and I even embarked on a 10 mile walk through the brisk night air. It was a great experience, I felt very exhilarated and alive. I find the mindset it puts me in to be very similar to the most positive aspects of a psychedelic trip!

I'm prone to paranoia and sensitive to THC in general, so I always tread carefully when it comes to sativa-dominant hybrids. However, Permafrost has consistently provided a wonderful clear-headed and euphoric high, without any paranoia whatsoever. The body high is subtle and I personally did not feel the pain relief was anything significant, but t...”"

SirBronn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/permafrost/reviews/1308733,"“Permafrost is a true gift for sufferers of anxiety and depression. It works wonders in the morning as an engine starter and replaced my red bull/coffee.  Permafrost has a nutty taste that is reminiscent of white widow, though no where near as strong, mixed with a mint like flavor. The instant effects have driven away several panic attacks and for that reason alone I always try to keep some permafrost on hand.”"
