taekwonlibra,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-blue-shark/reviews/1433142,"“Such a flavorful strain. I buy this for the higher CBD content but it packs a decent punch for a high. Earthy, chem tasting inhale, blueberry/florally exhale. Relieves nerve pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc and puts me in a chill, happy mood. 

Great medicine for medical cannabis patients.”"

This means I have to choose the flowers I consume wisely so I get the most out of every experience. This also means I’m finding great enjoyment from some of the less potent flowers, many of which are biased toward the CBD side of the spectrum. 
I am also very lucky to have the opportunity to visit Amsterdam multiple times each...”"

For pain and inflammation. Nice for the novice smoker. Thick resinous buds, great smell.”"
NMHiker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-blue-shark/reviews/1451964,"“Nice strain for pain. I'm recovering from a hip replacement. I tried this for some of the pain I was having. This is a nice relaxing strain. It is good for pain and inflammation. It is very floral in taste, with some blueberry, very nice not overwhelming. The buzz from this is nice and relaxing good for rehabbing a hip.  I smoked a pre-roll so I don't know what the bud looks like.”"
Biguzi035,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-blue-shark/reviews/1519286,"“I just picked up some Blue Shark CBD and smoke one bowl and so far the strain has helped my stress level and depression level go down. I also feel super relaxed, that’s how I like to feel but it’s hard when I don’t smoke. I will rate this strain the best in my opinion because every other CBD strains I smoked got me relaxed and made me feel better but not enough.”"
Fibro_Witch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-blue-shark/reviews/1475247,"“This strain is good for night use. Definitely sedating, find myself yawning all the time. Good for treating insomnia, but not necessarily locking. I was hoping for a little better pain relief with this one (Comparatively, Critical Mass is much more effective for pain relief). Does tend to dry out my eyes quite a bit.”"
Mcaveman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-blue-shark/reviews/1475369,"“My favorite strain , melts my pain and anxiety. Just enough indica to relax you but not put you to sleep. Heavy body relaxation also”"

Cbd blue shark by Marley natural is medicine. Splitting a spliff had had me zoned off mentally and physically on the rocks watching the the waves roll into puget sound. The experience was mystical. My anxiety and depression was eliminated. I had pain in my head, joints, and muscles that seemed to go away completely or just be barely noticeable. Tastes like berries, cream, and hops....”"

Fibro_Witch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-blue-shark/reviews/1632871,"“I felt compelled to write another review after using this during the day. Before I only tried it at night and it certainly helped me sleep. But I tried it during the day and was amazed at how versatile this strain is. During daytime use, I get so much done! Dishes are an absolute pleasure to do. It's so weird! The most menial tasks that I usually hate doing are now fun and engaging. This strain can be whatever you ne...”"

PodunkGreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-blue-shark/reviews/1522623,"“Barneys Farm describes this as:
"CBD Blue Shark is an Indica dominant strain created by a cross of Skunk #1 and CBD Enhanced. Blueberry was crossed with the classic Shark Shock and finally bred with our CBD enriched Sativa to give this outstanding result.  This strain is hardy and mould resistant, and gives a great yield of citrus flavours flecked with a hint of Jasmine."

I found this to be one of my favorite strain...”"

This strain didn't get me crazy high but still made my depression temporarily go away. I felt very relaxed and comfortable. Sometimes less is more! Love from Scandinavia”"
neek247,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-blue-shark/reviews/1803043,"“This is an amazing strain, I love the deep relaxation your get with it; it helps with pain also but not as much as I would like. The taste is great and its nice and smooth in a joint.”"
Dorje108,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-blue-shark/reviews/1562906,"“Good strain. I'm dealing with all sorts of symptoms (pain, anxiety, depression, inflammation) from Lyme disease and I want something that kills my pain, that I can use all day, and that doesn't mess with my head. This performs admirably. The high is sedating and mellow but still functional. You definitely notice the indica in it. Pain relief is decent. Doesn't do much for intracranial swelling.”"
flamingtrash,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cbd-blue-shark/reviews/1573319,"“This is such a sweet, relaxing, smiley strain. It's appropriate for daytime use, just don't overdo it. I recommend CBD Blue Shark to anyone who is dealing with depression, especially if you're hanging out with someone you really enjoy. This one had my date and I holding hands and staring at each other for hours like teenagers. I do feel a touch of anxiety on the Shark due  to my extreme THC sensitivity (this one test...”"
