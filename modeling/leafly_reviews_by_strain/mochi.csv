Smoke is very smooth and after a few hits, you will feel your body go limp.  Your muscles and any stress wash away and you’ll be floating on a cloud for several hours.  These buds are total grinder killers and are visibly stunning.  Hard to find but there is a constant supply on the central co...”"

Timbaroo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mochi/reviews/1669075,"“All I can say is that I hope you try this strain out for yourself, you really won’t regret it. If you like Cookie strains, you’ll love this. If you’re like me and just don’t care for Cookie strains for some reason, you’ll enjoy this one a lot (and Thin Mint Cookies, which this partly comes from). One dab has set me to a solid 9. I’m in jeopardy now since my eyes have a HEAVY glazed look and my parents are home (old e...”"

newbstatus138,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mochi/reviews/1622331,"“heavy stoned eyes. perfect for after work or before bed. I like to take a shower while smoking this to prep for bed. don't expect to do much.”"
Lady-Ganjas-Garden,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mochi/reviews/1627972,"“Sweet taste, sweet feeling. Tastes like Vanilla. Great clear headed energy and relaxing body high. Can’t go wrong with this strain.”"
SupremeHQ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mochi/reviews/1794014,"“giggly, explorative, but some type of slow lazyness following up, we had major munchies but its okay, because it gave us energy to be task orientated and bake some snibbles hehehehe”"
LeaflyDude710,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mochi/reviews/1685405,"“Beautiful buds that are dense, dark and frosty with unique smell to it. Not the loudest strain out there but the sweet overtones are definitely something to admire. Definitely leaning to the indica side, my eyes are drooping writing this review!”"
Abvchef,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mochi/reviews/1670621,"“be prepared for paranoia on the comeup. I convinced myself that Im the worst excuse of a human ever.  then I watched a movie and got some killer muchies. if you dont feed your muchies you will get a bad headache imo. good strain after paranoia wears off. would not buy for 25/g again though”"

Very relaxed and a bit sleepy after some hours.”"
Hermaphrodizer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mochi/reviews/1731910,"“I give this strain a 5 because of how unique the high was for me. I usually go for something with more of a body load. However, upon smoking this with my mom, the absence of a heavy body load didn’t matter to us. We were very talkative and sharp. The flowers looked black. Reminded me of an old old rumor I remember from my childhood about a black strain that was suppose to be amazing. So on that we bought some. And lo...”"
