sarahthaguru420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bubblegun/reviews/1062060,"“This strain is really good for people that suffer from insomnia. I used it a lot when I was younger and my head was a mess. When I went to bed back then, I couldn't rest because of all of my thoughts. Bubblegum makes sure you sleep tight. I smoked it 2 hours before bedtime and I was gone when I laid my head to rest.”"

Chief1Xa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bubblegun/reviews/1208051,"“Honestly, this isn't that bad. I wanted to give it two stars, but I did feel pretty swell after smoking. I've had other highs that were wayyy better, but I'm not complaining. As a buyer I wouldn't seek out this strain, but if offered I wouldn't turn it down.”"
