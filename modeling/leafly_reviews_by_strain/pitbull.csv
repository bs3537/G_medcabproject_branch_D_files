I suffer from chronic, intractable pain as a result of a spinal cord injury so I was looking for a strain that would help relieve the pain. On exhale, I was already feeling less pain.

I can't talk.  Seriously.

I think it runs for $9 a gram at the apothecary. I usually buy the more expensive strains. This one is great, powerful and I don't get the I feel stupid and couchlocked effects.”"

It makes you sleepy but if you power through you reach a place where youre creative, happy, and mild. A real mellow high from what I'm used to, kicks you on your ass afterwards but tucks you in bed and youll wake up feeling better.”"

The smell radiating from this strain was so sweet, right up there with strains like Tangie and Maui Waui. Where this strain really shines is the high, where you'll be so incredibly relaxed and calm. Fantastic.”"

Burns gloriously and even. Light feel to the smoke but on exhale I tend to get a strong taste of grape Kool-Aid. Smoking out of a bong with ash catcher and ice makes for a fantastic experience with this bud. Primo!  Too bad I've only been able to find this in 1g packs.”"

It smells quite flowery and sweet, with some citrus including pineapple and lime.  It's buds are nice and dense. Green with some red and a slight gold.”"
