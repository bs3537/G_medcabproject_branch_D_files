Ok so right off the back opening the sealed glass jar (super nice btw) I'm smacked in the face with a full blast of citrus and tropical aroma so potent you'll have a lil aura of tropical dank within a few seconds, definitely smells better than any pineapple I've ever had before hands down.

When you absolutely, positively must be ripped outta your tiny mind, you'll want some of this standing by. Sea-level to cruising altitude in about 5 minutes -- and it's a long flight after that.

This weed will bring you to a mental jacuzzi in which you will feel warm all over and as if you were baking in the sun. This weed is California as hell as in trill plus hot.

Tastes great and has a nice steady high. "My opinion" Take two puffs, back way , come back in 15 min and take another two puffs and so on.... It'll give you a nice steady high without being over board. Very fruity and no hunger issues. great strain to stay skinny...

She said it provided a "very happy" high, and I couldn't agree more. This strain is the Prozac of the cannabis world! The high was very upbeat and positive (dare I say euphoric?) and gave me that "all is good in the world" feeling. It also made me very outgoing, making it an excellent social lubricant. The high was so well balanced: u...”"

Also delivers the reckless confidence of alcohol. Strong hallucinogenic disassociation with a euphoric, positive energy driving from the chest. A ⅓ suppressive mellowness that’s couch-locky. Vision is slow to respond, but focus and field of view is razor sharp. However, just like the mental state, you can only hold focus for a few second...”"

The smell was very tropical (think papaya) and tasted just the same.  The high comes on fast and strong.  You can tell this hydrid is definitely weighted more heavily on the sativa side.  Lots of energy and a great cerebral rush.  Upon my first use of this, I did smoke a bit too much and it's relaxing body high took me down.  Af...”"

I an in love with this incredible sativa leaning hybrid.  The terpenes are top shelf.  Plenty of strains claim to smell like this or that, but Golden Pineapple really does smell like pineapple candy.
