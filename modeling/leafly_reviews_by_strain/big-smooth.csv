It takes like a blueberry glazed cake donut, in a way. It smells sweet like berries, its earthy, and piney. It comes on super strong, so it might be one to look out for if you're new to smoking. And its effect are distributed pretty evenly. Firstly, it hits you like a t...”"

The budtender was insistent that I give this a whirl, so I grabbed an 1/8th of flower.  

That 1/8th went quickly, lol! The smell of blueberry was for sure there and as mentioned in other reviews, there was a "doughy" finish.  L...”"

Oceanlvr420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/big-smooth/reviews/1680386,"“I'm really enjoying this strain I've never heard of before in this area until now. It has a really high THC level (the flower I have levels in at 30%) leading me to question the testing used at the facilities. 
Nevertheless, it is still an awesome hybrid with a high THC % that doesn't kick my ass and put me out. I like to be able to function with a great euphoric high and this bud allowed me to do just so. 
Again, I'...”"

Aroma: Sweet, fresh, and flowery but not perfume-y. Honestly, smelled like an amazing candle that I want my whole room to smell like. 1/1 Stars.

Taste: Creamy (and SMOOTH)! There's a bit of a fresh cut grass at first hit but then the after taste is definitely doughy. I'm not getting much from the Blueberry (my favorite set of strains) side of the parentage in terms of t...”"

1kushking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/big-smooth/reviews/1726142,"“This rare Indica leaning Hybrid by Viola contained 19% THC. Outside of the buds were medium green with touches of purple, while the inside was neon green. Buds had fuzzy peach hairs with white snowy trichomes & bright orange pistils. Sweet berry & blueberry was the taste & smell. Happy, relaxed, & sleepy were the effects. Big Smooth is a Big Winner!”"
TB-303,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/big-smooth/reviews/1522511,"“Great evening strain to chill with and get you in the right mind setting for a good nights sleep. Great smell and taste in the concentrate form that I tried from From Silver State Trade that made the Big Smooth strain CO2 cartridge. It allows you to eat some food, watch a movie and go to bed without any problems. Great strain.”"

I smoked this after a long day of home renovation and painting... and it was the best possible way to thank myself for all my hard work. 

Relaxing, level-headed, happy, giggly... but I was pretty distracted, so make sure if you still have things to do, you keep a list ;)”"
SirSparky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/big-smooth/reviews/1736704,"“Bright and pale green with dense sugary trichomes and burnt orange hairs. Smell is fuel which quickly shifts to sweet berry and faint pine.
Taste is awesome! Sweet earth with a slight pine undertone and expansive but very smooth smoke.
The high begins quite quick With a 50/50 buzz which is calming, introspective and positive.
Not too heavy but not overly-energizing. A perfect hybrid for winding down if you’re not qui...”"
tkrueger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/big-smooth/reviews/1443495,"“Its perfect for growing indoors. A very satisfying plant to grown indoors. Make sure to FIM so to ensure you get a lot of buds. Also this plant loves Dyna-grow's foliage pro and bloom. All who have tried my first harvest love it. It is strong so newbie beware.”"

Blaizze050687,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/big-smooth/reviews/1702232,"“I just picked up 2oz of this strain for a bargain, and man oh man was I pleasantly surprised at this recommendation. At first I couldn't really smell anything from the buds themselves, but they were light green, frosty and covered in orange hairs. So, I ground up a bowl, and as soon as I opened up the grinder I was hit with the aroma of sweet fruits, and an earthy/grassy aroma. Upon light the smoke was smooth and fla...”"
Grrltrouble,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/big-smooth/reviews/1661981,"“This strain is like a nice big dumb dog. Warm, friendly, happy, takes a second to get up from sitting but once you get going you're fine. Likes treats but isn't a hog. It's relaxed but up for anything. A very good addition to the repertoire.”"
devewev,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/big-smooth/reviews/1684595,"“This strain is fantastic for anxiety. When you first smoke it, you get its sativa effects making you happy, uplifted, and carefree. I do NOT whatsoever reccomend using this strain in the morning, however, as the heavy indica of its OG Blueberry parent will knock you out in an hour flat.”"
Waterknows,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/big-smooth/reviews/1547878,"“I suffer from anxiety now because of the high THC content in a lot of strains but with this I could ease my way back into a comfortable High just one hit and watching it come in slowly it's a good sedated slanted eyed hi where you just feel stoned enjoy playing video games and talking it also helps with going to sleep perfect for after work”"

After years of testing and breeding this train is meant to help people relax and have break from anxiety, PTSD, and just an overall great feeling.

We spend a lot of time making sure these generators come out correct for you, make sure the dispensaries are selling them are properly representing them. There are only three maybe four people who have axis to the stra...”"

Ostrodamus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/big-smooth/reviews/1761927,"“This is a pretty generic strain for me as far as effects and flavor profile. It made me very relaxed and calm. It smells more berry-like than it tastes. It also smells very earthy, although the same can be said about most strains I feel. All things considered I probably wouldn't really bat an eye at this strain again, with the overwhelming variety available on the market.”"

I am diagnosed with Aniexty and am thankful I did not smoke it with him- otherwise i could not take care of him. Be cautious veterans.”"
