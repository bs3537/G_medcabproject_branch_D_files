devin420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nevilles-haze/reviews/1212451,"“I smoked this nonstop when I had strep throat and I swear it cured me.”"
medijane,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nevilles-haze/reviews/1396969,"“Nice strain for depression and stress.  Mood/mind altering for sure.  Will give you even more patients to deal with stressors.

Mid to heavy dose relieves depression, social anxieties & stress.  

Strain also warms the body and mind; great for arousal.

Decent energy and makes music even more bitchin'.”"

My day immediately brightned I got that warm feeling of being at peace with the world.  It's an experience non-pot smokers will never feel and that's unfortunate. That part of the high only lasted about an hour but I felts its effects for hours later.”"

I can only relate my first experience of this strain to that of mushrooms. I heard subtle noises all around me, my mind would race, and every time I closed my eyes I saw techno color images swirling about. I wouldn't recommend this for a novice. My only thoughts on the reviews which stated this to be a weak smoke are that...”"

Very excited to be able to smoke it all day without wanting to pass out. Smoked about a gram of it already and it's very potent, the scent is strong lemon and diesel, taste is earthy, spicy, a true haze. As my girl friend and I both put it, this bud takes you to a different place than most any other buds do.”"

beareatweedyum,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nevilles-haze/reviews/1303981,"“Neville's Haze is an above-average Haze strain, with effects that lean toward the weightless cerebral kind, which I'm told are redolent of the earlier Haze varieties. The particular strain that I tried was one that was crossed with a variety called "citrus haze," which combine to create a highly pleasant lime flavor, which with the natural lemony flavor of Neville's Haze makes for delicious vapor bag and smoke.

All I have to say is, along with MotherShip, this is my new favourite hybrid. It's got that dominate awesome heady high, while keeping it super mellow with a strong indica.

It was like you feel the sensation in your head but you are still there a bit behind the eyes, deeper in your head. It is hard to describe. I felt a bit tingly in my fingers and talking was the best thing to do on this strain. However, like I said some other haze hybrids are stronger and last longe...”"

Neville's Haze did not look like the greatest bud, a sativa-like plant structure that looked and felt way too light and fluffy.

The taste and the smell took me back to the late 80"s and reminded me of that lost scent and taste that has been missing from the good earth for so long, due to all these hybrids.

PROs smoke. Not for children.”"
