skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lost-coast-og/reviews/1410001,"“Oh. My. God. This strain. Oh my god this strain. It's not necessarily my all time favorite, but it's one of those strains that you can recommend to anyone and you know they'll love it, you can smoke it any time of day while doing pretty much anything and you'll feel great... it's a near perfect strain, honestly. 

I've found it to be an almost exclusively mental and head high, but it does slow down the body a bit in ...”"
jbass89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lost-coast-og/reviews/1589991,"“Without question one of the finest strains I have tried in my 40 years of using cannabis. I use it in the evening, after I am done working, and when I want a mental withdrawal from everyday life. I vape it with a Storz and Bickel Mighty at 200 degrees C. The high comes within 10 minutes, and lasts about 3 hrs with a gentle come down. While high, there is no couch lock, I feel light, as if I am floating in a pool of w...”"
PaleoStoneMan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lost-coast-og/reviews/1540287,"“Wow. This floral lavender citrus taste. It's weird. I'm using a Davinci vaporizer and and I had to turn the heat up from usual settings to properly vape the bud. Once I did, the lavender citrus taste got kicked up a notch and this slow wave of quiet, creative introspection crept over me. I will reiterate what another reviewer mentioned - I had a lot of weird thoughts (in a good way). I have every time I smoked or vap...”"

LittleFox7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lost-coast-og/reviews/1352197,"“I loved everything about this bud, and I could tell it was going to be a favorite strain just by looking at it. The smell is phenomenal and the vibrant green flower is covered in deep orange hairs and crystals; its hands down the prettiest weed I've ever had. It tastes like a sunset looks and the high is euphoric and great for helping with depression and anxiety. I could smoke this strain any time of day or night and...”"
jamaicadreamin99,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lost-coast-og/reviews/1512633,"“This strain is incredible and definitely worth trying! I would describe this strain as a more hallucinagenic version of Deathstar. It's very relaxing, uplifted, euphoric and happy. Definitely an amazing strain for just hanging out, sleeping and thinking. I also highly recommend it for depression. I also have some crazy thoughts when I smoke Lost Coast OG, in a good way! Highly recommended.”"
Severin18017,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lost-coast-og/reviews/1694540,"“It had a very good taste. I did not like the effects though. It left me very anxious.

CowboyRN,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lost-coast-og/reviews/1475347,"“This bud starts off with a flower or floral taste that turns earthy as you vaporize it. I use a vape that uses flower rather than oil. Began with a little eye pressure that quickly became euphoric. A great bud for a long an emotionally exhausting day. Not a bad flower but fairly mild and slow onset. Definitely something I'll use before or during work.”"

Really helped with my pain and gave me greater mobility. Felt a bit sluggish and full feeling, so best for when you don't need to be too energized. Really beautiful, complex flavors due to the many terp of this og.”"

It was packaged in parchment paper as some sort of muck/oily mess.  The flavor was mild.  Nice relaxing body buzz with tranquilizing effects.  It takes a few minutes to kick in, and is pretty mild.  Probably good for meditation or treating anxiety.”"
