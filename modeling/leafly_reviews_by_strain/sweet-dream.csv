I was trying to take a T break cause I was at the point where 3 grams of GDP wasn't even getting me high... so im 3 days into my T break and I get talked into smoking this shit... and I was blown away.

I left my body. we went out to eat and I went cerebral palsy on the cash register. everything was in third person yo. like I was above myself looking down. fucking insane. 10/...”"

Wanted to try it based on the Leafly description, with my depression and anxiety, it sounded right up my alley. It's a light high, it's not heavy, doesn't put you to sleep but keeps you wake without being too hyper. Just a nice calm, chill, light and airy high. Was perfect for my anxiety and dep...”"
bosieboy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dream/reviews/1368766,"“An amazingly uplifting and surprisingly euphoric hybrid! Gives you the warm fuzzies, encouraging productivity. Just relaxing enough to relieve anxiety. Great strain for depression.”"

Delicious earthy berry flavor. Slow oncoming sedation/relaxation. Deep introspective thoughts. High creativity and problem solving. Eventually slows to a relaxed hazey happy. Love it.”"
Evan38,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dream/reviews/1575789,"“I bought an 8th of this strain about 2 months ago. I took a couple hits on probably 4-5 occasions and i was honestly not overly impressed. I guess I had expected more of balanced clear high at low doses and everytime I smoked it during the day it definitely slowed me down. I came across the bag today while going through my collection and decided I would give it a serious test mid evening. I took about 8 or 9 good hit...”"

negatives: dry mouth, very slightly paranoid, and clumsy”"
DaniHell,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dream/reviews/1524475,"“Small sugar coated nuggets and crumbs from Forwardgro in Maryland. Smell and taste was clean a little piney and citrus, hits really nice in a joint. The buds themselves were a little dry and crumbly but not harsh tasting. I really like this strain and I hope to get it again in the future.”"
tgibson43,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dream/reviews/1535045,"“Great smell and flavor. No anxiety. Light and mellow high. A double-threat in that SD doesn’t slow you down or deplete your energy or motivation but can be great for relaxation or sleep if that’s what you’re after.”"
mizzoh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dream/reviews/1526174,"“This is a nice strain. I vaped a little bit and felt relaxed yet focused and alert. The high lasted a decent time too. This is a prefect daytime strain to help with stress and pain.”"
BongWayIsBestWay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dream/reviews/1595442,"“It's a pretty heavy headed high. The Indica is definitely what I feel the most. I'm vert relaxed. Calm. Able to think a little clearly and focus a little more as a result of not being able to keep still, like in class. 

I wouldn't smoke this throughout the day, but definitely would before bed.”"
