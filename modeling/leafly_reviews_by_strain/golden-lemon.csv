Golden Lemon
=============
Goronk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-lemon/reviews/1471032,"“Wow... being a seasoned smoker this strain is absolutely amazing!! The lemon aroma is instantly noticed with a strong citrus onset, almost diesel-like.  Leave this beast in a jar or sealed because she can spread quick and heavy!  I would suggest vaping this strain to pull out the most flavor.  You will be hit with the lemon and followed up by the citrus rush.  The effects have a rapid onset (less than 5 minutes) with...”"

Having a very high tolerance for flower, I’m always on the lookout for strains, usually indica or indica-dominant strains that hit me fast and hard and doesn’t leave me ready to light up again in 15 minutes.  What really amazed me was that I felt this intense cerebral high after smoking only a 1/4 of the preroll.  I’ve smoked many 1 gram prerolls to the fa...”"

What I didn't realize is that skunk strains (especially ones grown in specifical artificial lighting conditions) develop into higher concentrations of THC.

Stimplit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/golden-lemon/reviews/1669737,"“Clean, clear. Mild level of distraction. Good uplifter. Keeps energy up. You can engage in conversation. Zero paranoia or anxiety. I would say it is smooth rather than psychoactive. Has some level of lightness to it, at higher doses it might induce giggles. Makes you happy.”"

This is some of the finest herb I've ever encountered.  At 27.28% THC this knocks you into euphoria.  Music never sounded better than when you're high on Golden Lemon.
