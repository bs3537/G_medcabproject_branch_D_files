I only experimented occasionally in my youth, for a year or two when I first when to college. My experiences were very mixed, but for the most part, I didn't like it. 

I decided to start researching cannabis use again as I've developed terrible insomnia which is brought on by anxiety attacks at night. Also, I do enjoy having a drink, but I'd like...”"

I have been researching cbd for a while thinking it may hold the answer to my treatment resistant depression and anxiety. 10 years of mental illness and pain is long enough. I finally got access to cbd nordle from cbd crew. tested at 8% cbd, 16% thc. It has noticeably reduced my chronic stomach pain, anxiety, and depression. Has worked 5x better than any psych meds I have tried (i've tried about 20) and...”"
GimpyTwoLegs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nordle/reviews/1413444,"“Great medical strain. Sweet, sugary smell. Doesn't produce a strong cough. High CBD and modest/low THC levels, making it a poor choice for recreational users but a perfect choice for many medical users. The effects of this plant are amazing. It creates such a mild high that it is almost unnoticeable. What is noticeable is how wonderful you will feel. The effects on anxiety/PTSD is simply amazing. The high CBD/THC rat...”"
greffon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nordle/reviews/1371826,"“Got this strain as Argyle from Tweed as a Canadian Medical Marijuana patient. I would say that this is a great strain for starters and equally for those experienced. Experienced medical users often have a nice cheap form of medicine with high amounts of CBD, this is what stashes that section for me.

Taking this up on its own, or mixed to support another strain, you can't go wrong with this stuff. Anything with high ...”"

The day after I bought it I woke up with the worst altitude/tension/sinus migraine I've had in a long time...I thought we were stuck, there was no way I could drive; I could barely open my eyes. So I gave it a shot: 2 tokes and 2 minutes later it was gone! No pharmaceutical has ever been so fas...”"
Nikond300,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nordle/reviews/1394102,"“Great strain!  Only downside or positive side is the CBD is just as high as the THC with this strain.  It's more of a body stone, bringing pain relief for me and my MS.”"
SkinnyKid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nordle/reviews/1397746,"“If you're looking for a smooth Indica that's going to mellow you out, relax you, and end up putting you into a good night's sleep, this is for you. 

By far, my favorite CDB strain. I was reluctant to try it at first, as I was enjoying the Canna-Tsu strain, and went to pick up a bit more, only to find out they were out. 

Intrigued that this was an Indica, I decided to give it a go. Awesome. 

I vaporize this at nigh...”"
seanzy84,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nordle/reviews/1346206,"“very good high cbd strain, probably one of my favorite cbd cannabis strains. nice mellow body feel, and very nice slight head high, nice relaxation, or for pain inflammation. tastes a little like Afghan but with that distinctive cbd cannabis taste, but overall pretty good tasting. would smoke again. tested at 10%/10% ratio from urban wellness in Albuquerque”"
victoriauhl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nordle/reviews/1395972,"“This strain was recommended by a budtender at Ganja Goddess for an evening / de-stress vibe, and she totally nailed it. (For context, I am a *very* light use / occasional smoker that seeks out high CBD strains for relaxation + anxiety reduction with low psychoactive effects,)

Onset was a little bit heady, but eased quickly + gently into a really killer state of mental and physical relaxation. Took away the stress of...”"

sourskittles,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nordle/reviews/1395967,"“Probably one of the best tasting CBD strains! It also has a nice relaxing high that isn't to intense. Definitely up there with the CBD strains I have tried.”"
BC_leaf,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nordle/reviews/1338495,"“Smooth and calming, high in CBD.  This stuff smells like turkish delight (walnuts and sugar and fruit) and gives a light, pleasant stone.  Its pretty easy on the mind; I thought it was weak at first but the CBD effect is fabulous.”"
Dharma241,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nordle/reviews/1283400,"“This strain is found as "Argyle" from Tweed (Canadian grower).  Low in both THC and CBD, this is helpful as a daytime remedy for my anxiety.  Other strains with low THC sometimes have a higher CBD content which leaves me feeling irritable.  Vaping is my delivery method of choice. The initial "high" wears off after about an hour and I can focus to get things done.”"
CrstlSilk,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nordle/reviews/1743651,"“I bought this strain from the SQDC from Soleil. I really wanted to like this strain because of the the high CBD (about 13%) compared to THC (7%) but I got anxious (self defeating thoughts and self judgement). I tried to mix it with another high CBD strain (Cannatonic), I tried smoking less.. Hélas! I can only feel fine if I smoke an extremely low amount with another strain... But, I have BPD, so I smoke to mellow out...”"

It's pretty mild and it's extremely calming which I love because I tend to get a lot of anxiety, so I try to avoid strains that might not help with that. I'm always extremely comfortable using this strain though, it really puts me at ease and is such a calming high.”"

Whenever I’m stressed about school or work or anything, this calms me, keeps me on task and motivates me to do what I need to do. You don’t feel a true high from this, but medically perfect strain. Mixing with alcohol is a ticket for a happy party without the loopy or dizzy feeling,”"

Very relaxing, doesn't really get you "high" like other strains might, really feels like the "beer" version of weed.  I got a little bit anxious the first time I had it but it only lasted for a little, and it was really mild.  Perfect strain for someone who's looking to try cannabis for the first time.”"

I am able to concentrate on work, converse with clients, and complete my day to day tasks without feeling super high. Also, this is a solid strain to smoke 5-10 mins befo...”"

Gives me just the right amount of energy and allows me to relax and enjoy the time with my friends. Definitely recommended for that scenario. The downside is when I smoke it alone.
