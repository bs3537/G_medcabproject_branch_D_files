Purple Wreck
=============
THCWA,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-wreck/reviews/1390417,"“Purple Wreck is one of my all-time favorite hybrids. It's a cross between Purple Urkle X Trainwreck, a little bit will keep you going but a lot will incapacitate you. This is a very strong strain that can be excellent for day or night use. With almost instant effects behind the eyes and in the temples, Purple Wreck works beautifully for relieving headaches as well as sinus and ocular pressure, but it is not for the f...”"

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-wreck/reviews/1386875,"“The phenotype that I purchsed had no purple tinge in it but this is by far the best product I have smoked. Has a sweet smell with an underlying odor of diesel. The PW relieved all my anxiety and lifted my spirits up and made me feel very well and happy. This strain also gave me lots of energy and my creative juices were unleashed. This medicine is, in my opinion, among the best.”"
OBFilterhaux,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-wreck/reviews/1374360,"“I've never smoked train wreck before, but now understand where the "wreck" part comes in. I smoked half a joint of organically grown and properly cured bud. Its one of those weeds that hits you so hard that you dont even realize you're high until about 15 min into the high. It made me talkative, and helped me through some slight depression.”"
DavM,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-wreck/reviews/1214522,"“Had this as shatter. Smooth and delicious. Tasted like sweet grape/berries with a hint of tar. Gives it a subtle black licorice aftertaste. For like a sec or two. Not exactly like it but it's all I can think of to describe to a relatable flavor.”"

Lasted perhaps an hour and after it faded I recognized my episode of paranoia.  I don't know if it was just me, that day. I recommend this, it's powerful and tastes great, helped with muscle spasms etc. very well, and say just be aware of the possible paranoid feelings.  Have ...”"

The buds were mostly a deep purple with some green and a light dusting of trichromes. The buds were bone dry and after smoking left a decently clean gray ash. Taste was hints of blueberry on the exhale.

The effects were mild, requiring several bowls to feel a ...”"

ostra,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-wreck/reviews/1362396,"“Popping open a container of Purple Wreck is like opening a giant bag of skittles filled with only grape skittles, it's super sweet! Delicious grape clouds wrap you in absolute bliss, loving that the body buzz sets in almost instantly. Really uplifting and very euphoric in high doses. It's also pretty incapacitating at higher doses, Purple Wreck definitely lives up to it's name!”"
JSound,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-wreck/reviews/1388142,"“one of my favorite strains of buying from Arizona Organix. THC % is usually 22%+ the lowest I have got was 21.somthing% THC.  Honestly I'm a different type smoker. I don't care about flavors, smell, looks and or anything else except how stoned do I get. I prefer a heavy heavy mind and body high.

Andru,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-wreck/reviews/1169097,"“I really liked this strain. It's had all the qualities that I like and require for sacred Medicines. Amazingly frosted neon green with lavender colors everywhere. Super dense buds that are almost too dense if there was such a thing. Tastes like it smells.  My wife who doesn't smoke loves it, gentle enough with one hit to uplift and provide head change while she still feels normal.”"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-wreck/reviews/1336520,"“I ordered this strain from Tweed to try because it was a good price and I was looking for another night time Indica. Quite frankly there was little else on offer at Tweed. The THC content was only 9%. The buds were quite dry and crumbly.

Very complex taste similar to many Purple Indica dominant strains that I've tasted.
