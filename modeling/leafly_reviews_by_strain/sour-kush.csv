I found that I was able to be up and around without that couch locking stone that kush can usually give me. With the new hybrids of Kush, I find that I am able to use them during the day!

It crumbles into a powder if you handle it to hard which makes it smoke harsh. I think the price is a little to high for the quality of the flowers.  And the quantity of the flowers for sale needs to increase so that you can purchase it on a day convenient to you. I wish these issues could be solved as your location is close and frie...”"

The taste left a lot to desire ,and the kush didnt really add anything worthwhile to the high. This stuff is pretty passable and I would just suggest some other strain that is a good indica hybrid like blue dream or strawberry cough.
