Houseofsatan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/amnesia-og/reviews/1735405,"“A lifesaver. 

Hits the head really hard while relaxing the body.

I’m an over thinker, and have horrible anxiety, and this strain makes your worries go away. 

As a medical only user, 
This strain has changed my life.”"

Taste was very cheesy (more like blue cheese rather than Cheese) and pungent (comparable to Sour Diesel). Overall it was a good sesh, would highly recommend. 

Dosage was 1g dry bud @ 24% thc”"
