Weird because it's very smooth on the inhale but suddenly tickles the back of your throat on the exhale. I have mixed opinions about the after effects. Although it made me and my friends geek out and be quite giggly, I also experienced a feeling that made me a little paranoid as I was outside.

I would say that it's a strain to be smoked to just have a good time and chill out and jam to some tunes or watch a good movie.”"

A quick sharp lift off with a falling-leaf come down, with a nice buzz that lasts for a few hours after you're sober. Be careful with this one, one toke over the line will most likely knock you out. One of the best strains I've smoked in a long time. Next up, vaporizing it!”"

Taste is sweet and earthy with a smooth draw that won't make you cough your chest apart. The high is a mix of cerebral and tingly effects, with some potential for synaesthesia if you're the type to smoke with music playing.

lovethehaze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-haze/reviews/1384919,"“Definitely one of my top 5 strains of all time. The fabulous taste of the haze is prevalent on every hit and the buzz overcomes you instantly with a clear headed and energetic high. If smoked in moderation the true effects of the sativa come through very nice and the effects last for hours. Would definitely recommend, very nice. 5 star AAA weed for sure.”"
ELNiNo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-haze/reviews/1102425,"“Not my kind of strain, do not like it after a few tests. Heart races, I get easily paranoid. I only get lazy, nothing special.”"

smoked some to get rid of a bad headache and try to work a little. im feelin that drive to get things done, headaches gone, got a nice calm feeling.”"
danklet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-haze/reviews/1251248,"“Smoked with friends, lets me feel almost completely sober but some of my senses are magnified (taste, feeling). This makes eating awesome, as well as doing menial everyday tasks. For my friends that don't have much tolerance, this got them high, but with their senses magnified too. But my friends that do have tolerance this made them feel the exact same as me. Awesome.”"

curious_concept,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-haze/reviews/1102410,"“This may not be the strongest thing out there, but it's definitely the cleanest feeling haze I have ever had.  The Blueberry works on the muscles, the haze gives you a little euphoria but it doesn't affect memory or awareness.  Top notch stuff.  A must try.”"
DxstortRawReality,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-haze/reviews/1197057,"“By far the nicest strain I ever smoked, perfect balance between happy and mellow//tired. I closed my eyes and felt like I was floating through space”"
bobericc,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-haze/reviews/1216826,"“top notch.. after going through blue dream and blueberry hase back and forth i can see the original haze cross is more favorable. the BD looks like a better haze and maybe more potent. but the high from the blueberry haze is almost trippy and long lasting. great day herb. mentholated berries”"

It hits you minutes after you've started smoking so chill after a couple hits and then go back. It's a nice mix between a head and body high. Super dreamy and definitely a strain for veteran smokers.”"

I can't express how disappointed I am with what I received. Not fuzzy at all, dry to the point of just crumbling to nothing in the packaging, had a very strong grass smell. So many stems and sticks that it hardly left anything to actually smoke. Complete waste of money and time trying to smoke it. Wil...”"
callouskitty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-haze/reviews/1102460,"“Definitely loved making blueberry-flavored vapor clouds. This has about as nice a fruit/citrus taste as I've had, and would be an eye-opener for any non-toker who thought all weed smelled like skunk.

I had about 12 slow draws with my pax on low and felt pretty good. My thoughts got very loud and I was giggling and cheerful. I got very good sensory effects, enjoyed some new music and savored some delicious food. Ther...”"
