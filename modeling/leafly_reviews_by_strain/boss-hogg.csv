mediator,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1393583,"“This strain was amazing! Euphoric, happy, giggly and ready for a snack. Great with company. I'm going in for seconds!!”"
JoshKahle10,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1393587,"“One of the best strains I've had in a while. Very even body and head high, but the euphoria is definitely the strongest aspect of it. A very fun and chill high.”"
lilbp420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1393585,"“This is a nicely balanced hybrid strain.  I purchased this as a gram on a week or so back, testing the waters out of the indicas that I normally purchase.  This is because the main symptoms I'm treating are insomnia and pain.  So this is a new feeling for me.  But lets get back to the strain.

I believe this strain is one the dispensary grows themselves, if not it still is a good stuff.  The batch date is 04/14/2017 ...”"
chckrbordx57,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1393584,"“One of my favorite things about this strain is the smell. Very pleasant earthy smell with a hint of citrus at the end. 

The high starts with a euphoric, sharp clearheaded feeling that lasts throughout the high, followed by deeply relaxing body sedation. 
Music: 'Hey You' - Pink Floyd
Terpines: Myrcene, Limonene, Caryophyllene”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1491129,"“Form: Shatter
Brand: Canamo Concentrates
THC: 72%

Appearance 5/5
- Amazing looking, beautiful amber colored shatter mostly translucent.

Taste 4/5
 -Nothing special, slightly harsh.

Feel 5/5
- Very euphoric indeed. I usually don't care for chemdawg strains, but the euphoria is unreal.  This stuff would be great to manage my nausea (I suffer from something that makes me feel like I'm always motion sick....vertigo ma...”"
Unhooked,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1392838,"“Boss Hogg has a wonderful aroma and flavor notes. For me the euphoric effects are a bit strong but it gradually settles into a nice numbing body high which is great for my hip and back pain. I did not find that it helps with focus at all. I may have been tired from work but I know I was super absent minded after smoking this strain.”"
CO26,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1370263,"“I tend to be a sativa girl but wanted to try this for stress relieve and lower back muscle tension. Definitely more of a body high than head high but still some cerebral effects. It completely relaxed me, muscle tension melted away. I did end up taking a nap but I am not sure that was because of the bud. Also great fro appetite stimulation. I will likely keep this on hand for when I am struggling with my back.”"

Starquake,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1393586,"“Honestly was not too impressed. Given it  was only 10.8% THC, I barely felt any effect even smoking a decent amount of it. Gave it 3 stars just for the slight calm it gave me.”"

spilknot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1392835,"“This was a very sporadic strain for me. I did feel the harshness on the throats at first but few bowls later felt smooth. Does have a strong smell but has a piny scent so it's not too bad. Awesome pick!”"
IncogNeato,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1392837,"“Giggly, heavy indica stone.  Not the cleanest high, but get ready to giggle.”"
Gfunk007,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1348131,"“A true 50/50 Hybrid to the tee! Also the taste through vaporization is a tangy bit of goodness that has me lovin this strain!”"

RedRedRose,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1444668,"“I have a feeling this would be a really good in a group, but unfortunately I use most of my pot in private, so I know I'm not getting the full effect. I've mostly just pulled a few buds off and put them over a screen before, but I decided to grind some up and pack a bowl for use over the next few days. Holy hell, it knocked me right on my ass. If you're gonna grind it alone, put on some rad music and prepare for a tr...”"

moonstar11187,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boss-hogg/reviews/1392843,"“Illinois batch 17% THC. Let me just say I am not a fan. I think Boss Hogg may be the name of their cat that sprayed on the crop because all I tasted was ammonia. My house smelled like litter box after a few bowls. I did its job don't get me wrong , it has an effect, I just can't stand the flavor”"
