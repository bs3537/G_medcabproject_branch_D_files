I’m not a fan of gorilla glue on its own. For whatever reason it does not work with my brain as it does others. 
The addition of the white, changes it completely.

I actually like to use this strain with others to make it more uplifting for daytime or with an indica to help me sleep.

This strain always helps with my nausea and headaches. Definitely feels more like medicine in my system rat...”"

This is what you will be asking yourself when you pucker your lips for the first draw of Elmer's Glue. It is so smooth! Gentle on the lungs and a light taste that doesn't leave your mouth feeling like a bowl of cotton! 
My first hit had me focused on an area of pain in my back, but it went away after a few minutes. As far as head highs go, I think this is a relatively ligh...”"

At the end of the high, I went right to sleep. It smells like pine...lol. Earthy tasting. Wish I took a picture. Great crystal on the buds and a beautiful green.”"

Glah000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elmers-glue/reviews/1599030,"“I’ve tried a number of different strains and this one of by far my favorite. This is perfect for anyone who has depression, or has been feeling low and like they can’t get outside of the house. 

For me, all of my worries went away, I felt as if there was no reason to feel anxious or sad anymore, I could think clearly and was coherent enough to interact with others, I wanted to get out and explore (and did not have a...”"
bge1342,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elmers-glue/reviews/1579808,"“A Really Wonderful Hybrid Combo of GG4 & The White.  GG4 has been one of my favorite go to strain for several years now.  Elmer’s Glue takes the best parts of The White & the best parts of GG4 to produce a strain that is extremely strong but in a floaty, relaxed way, then after a few min the THC kicks in to let you down into an even more relaxed, Sunday Morning Wake & Bake, feeling.   😉. Definitely try it if you fin...”"

ray2363,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elmers-glue/reviews/1596780,"“This strain was AMAZING! I’m a huge fan of GG4 itself so when I saw this strain I figured I would give it a try and I loveeeeeee it. Very earthy, piney taste on the exhale and a smooth smoke throughout. Beware, though, a little goes a long way! This was a heavy strain that started behind the eyes and gradually moved down to the rest of my body. I know this is classified as a hybrid, but I would consider this more of ...”"

great for stomach problems”"
mmjmomlegalizeit81,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elmers-glue/reviews/1594157,"“Big beautiful colas that are bright green with some orange hues in there that you always should see in GG4, (one of the parent strains of Elmer's Glue) but The White genetics show up strong in this phenotype with a white dusting of trichromes covering the buds. It's very euphoric and I do not feel as sedated when The White is bred with an Indica. Definetly a great daytime strain for the seasoned smoker.”"

veteran4medz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elmers-glue/reviews/1702176,"“I can honestly say that the GG strain is creating a very strong relaxing family line. Elmer’s Glue was a strain that I decided to smoke cause my usual, Super Glue, was not available at my dispensary at the time. The bud is very fluffy and has a nostalgic piney undertone. The bud has that classic bud smell and taste. Elmer’s is so, let me emphasize, so smooth. I do not smoke like an teenager with something to prove to...”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elmers-glue/reviews/1625302,"“A very smooth smoke with strong yet soothing effects. Don't make plans on be active because it brings on some serious couch lock. Very talkative and lots of giggling followed by an eventual heavy come down.”"

LunaBee23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elmers-glue/reviews/1723735,"“Most likely because I’m a beginner,but it hit hard with sleepiness and thirst. Overall a good high,just not the type you can enjoy if you still have too get stuff done around in the day or if you have bad anxiety.”"
