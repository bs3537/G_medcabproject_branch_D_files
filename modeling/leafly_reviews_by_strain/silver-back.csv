Silver Back

MisterSickly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-back/reviews/1390780,"“Amazing euphoria! Really made me think deep but not so deep that my thoughts grew serious and anxiety induced. Helped me see past my current trials and realize myself as a whole I was happy. Amazing taste but pretty moderate - light cotton mouth. Overall amazing.”"

Not my favorite, but a treat nonetheless to sample. Sativa fans should keep an eye out for this rare strain.”"

CdnDrkLtr1960,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-back/reviews/1360300,"“I personally love this strain at just about any time of day. The slightly tropical taste is sweet and earthy, and the punch it packs is almost immediate! A very serious cerebral effect, and a nice euphoria. Ends with a good case of the munchies, and...whatever!”"

You can tell it's an indica dominant strain, but getting caught up in my work re-assures me that there definitely is sativa in this strain. I've noticed mild head aches well after being smoked, not always, could be the batch i got. I would say the experience smoker would definitely enjoy the head high & experience over all. Felt like complete euphoria x bliss...”"

It was 751mg THCA and 15mg of THC first time I’ve had something like this and I love it. Found it at Terrpin store in boulder in shatter form(looks more like surface though) delicious and smooth.”"
