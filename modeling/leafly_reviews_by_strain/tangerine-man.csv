MedicalIncredible,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangerine-man/reviews/1361813,"“Update:
A Potent Sativa like head high w/ likely paranoia.

AROMA is VERY COMPLEX !!!
Grapefruit, Mint, Body Odor, Cold Wind/Blue Ice, Lemon, Citrus. 

Not recommend to those who aren't expecting it's caffeine effect. 
(Let me suggest Blueberry Dream for a lot of us).

BUDS are dark green and rusty with light green airbrushing and evil looking Velcro looking trichomes. 
Physically their structure is very beautiful. P...”"

Effects kick in quickly and lasts an unusually long time. My dose intervals lengthened dramatically. Smoke too much and find yourself dozing. Headed bobbing lol. Enjoy!”"

At least I got a pretty box out of it. Okay on to the review of the strain. 
For this seasoned smoker, it's a no go. Beautiful citrus smell. But lacking on the crystals. 
I might try some others in the Leafs by Snoop line if they make it up this way to WA, I was able to purchase at a LivWell in CO.”"

IndicaArmy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangerine-man/reviews/1371986,"“The name reminds me of growing up in SoCal. It's like the Corn Man but the ones who sell oranges by the freeway. Fun fact, smokers in south US call low grade buds Corn, small buds pop corn and Amish say Green Corn. High grade they call "Loud" referring to the smell. 
I love the name, props to the Dog Father, I would love to blaze it up with you all and show you some of my high grades. MySativaArmy is my instagram and...”"

This work well blended alongside another strain in vaporizer. The scent was incredible when grinding- could completely smell the orange and citrus notes. First hit, I even tasted the citrus. TM totally balanced out the couch lock from the other strain- made for a great high, productive, giggly, fun. I'm a newbie so I wouldn't recommend...”"

MedicalIncredible,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangerine-man/reviews/1376898,"“Buds are more dense than not but not as dense as other Leafs by Snoop Flowers are.
Smell is akin to "Jillybean" and "Tangie/Tangerine", which some say can smell like body odor however those strains are great strains so I fully expect that unique aroma and that wicked head high.”"

Diesel765,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangerine-man/reviews/1224777,"“i got this strain from Livwell in Colorado. it was poorly trimmed (.5g of stems and leaves) on the 1/8 i got. the high was a moderate sativa feeling. it has a slightly strong citrus taste but not too much. this strain for me was best served in combo with other strains for the terpenes (taste) i wont buy it again.”"
dellanutella,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangerine-man/reviews/1249637,"“Herbacious and super sweet fruity citrus taste. Leafs by Snoop strains are potent to say the least and this has got to be one of my favorites.”"
