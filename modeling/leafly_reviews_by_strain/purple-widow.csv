=============
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-widow/reviews/1381133,"“Absolutely Fantastic! This strain is very dense! 
The Bud: Compact, foxtails on the top some nugs can range from quarter to half dollar and even bigger. Purple pops out on smaller nuggets very rich velvet color. Gave them a tug and they don't budge impressive never seen these beastly structures before.
The Smell: Kind of sweet, Earthy woody, kind of a nice funky aroma.
The Palette: Interesting like sweet funky flavor...”"

lushesgreens,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-widow/reviews/1626633,"“This strain is insane, one of a kind. batch I got was a little on the fluffy side but burns perfect in a joint. Beautiful forest green with light undertones and deep purple touches, this bud smells pretty sweet, citrus, floral, a little earthy.. just smells FANTASTIC. Taste pretty flowery, maybe tulip, and a little sweet, pine and leaves behind something like an orange rubbed in dirt. Immediately got super relaxed af...”"

The Bud: The structure is very bushy! Larger fan leafed nuggs, not dense at all, very brittle and super easy to grind. The bud has more of a sine-wave ripple effect from the top of the perfect christmas tree in copper colored pistols shrouding the ripple upward light g...”"

DannyVibes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-widow/reviews/1361475,"“After smoking this light sticky flower for a couple of days I was really impressed by how happy it made me. I was very energetic and talkative. Took great care of my anxiety and stress. Only complaint I have is I wish it created more of the super high quality keef. Really powerful and tasted great. Would recommend.”"
ValleyofGreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-widow/reviews/1361471,"“A very sweet floral scent on a beautiful mix of light  and dark green buds  and orange hairs with little spots of purple . came with a very sweet taste and a quick and lasting head buzz while making your body feel relaxed unless taken in heavy doses then leaves you feeling a bit couch locked but also I've noticed a increase in appetite.”"
inflames.bm,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-widow/reviews/1752853,"“Real nice bud structure. I like the bounce-back I get from squeezing these frosty trees. My fingertips CLEARLY rob the bud of quite a high amount of crystals yet you can’t tell when looking at the bud that it just lost THAT much lol - it’s THAT caked. The smoke is smooth - not as thick as I’d like it to be but nice clean burn with fruity-berry-ish finish. Starts off as a sociable, laughable, have-a-good-time kind of ...”"
barkda08,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-widow/reviews/1348847,"“Definetly tastes like a purple flavor and has the White Widow taste. I was happy to give it a try from Cannabliss - Sorority, and am exited to try flower again some time. Not too heavy or too light.”"

Yonex420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-widow/reviews/1591845,"“4 stars for almost getting me there, but not quite. Upon initial inspection these buds are pretty big ,dense, with a range of green hues mixed with purple and frosty trichomes. The aroma is sweet , with a good mix of earthiness and a lil pungency that WW offers. The initial effects were those of a Hybrid where my body did feel relaxed but yet i was    alert. My brain(which is usually racing) was still racing, but the...”"

cmcduffa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-widow/reviews/1329001,"“Amazing strain for calming, relaxed, and dreamy state but also a bit of a head buzz. works well for my pain and anxiety. That said, it gives me horrendous nightmares after falling asleep. I've never experienced nightmarish dreams after falling asleep before this strain. It never fails though, on the days I smoke this strain I will have bad nightmares and when I choose another strain, no nightmares. I wish I could smo...”"
