I'm still awake at 1am after smoking at 630pm...however, if I smoke this tomorrow after lunch I'll give it 5 for keeping up and motivated. Excellent daytime smoke - not so much in the evening. unless being up all night is the plan!”"
Th3rd3y3,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jackalope/reviews/1346878,"“(Chocolope x Black Jack) Super sweet Chocolope pollinated by a super tasty Black Jack father. Expect either a more sativa influenced chocolate pheno or a darker, more dense, fruitier Black Jack pheno. Both share the same taste and high but the sativa pheno is less fruity. Taste is slight raw chocolate with some berries and a hint of incense/opium. High is speedy with a slight sedative after effect. Never waste this i...”"

Easily one of the top 3 most potent smelling, sweet, fat, juicy sativas I have ever seen.  Very compact in resin and sparkly with trichome production. Long lasting....”"

The buds are dense and bursting with trichomes and has a very interesting chocolate berry taste. It's pretty harsh on the lungs, but it's definitely a classic head busting sativa.  I love it personally.”"

VanIslandCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jackalope/reviews/1386965,"“Amazing smell - earthy, piney, subtle hints of diesel. The trichomes were so abundant it made the Bud look almost wet. This strain felt like an indica to me - it starts out with a hazy feeling that eases into eventual couchlock, very good stuff.”"

This strain didn't hit my head as hard as I thought it would, however the high was mainly in the head with mild body pain relief. There is a slight crash when the medicine wears off.”"
