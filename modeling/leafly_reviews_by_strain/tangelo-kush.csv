KeatonJJ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangelo-kush/reviews/1391686,"“Super high trichome count. Honestly one of the most citrus flavours I have had. Lovely orange hairs and a great colour (green with flecks of dark green/purple). The effects were slightly slumped with a lot of laughs consistent high for a few hours. Would be good for insomnia or depression as it it uplifting and if smoked in quantity could put you to sleep. Over all lovely strain.”"

coop1211,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangelo-kush/reviews/1397659,"“This strain offers pretty looking nuggets with a nice balanced aroma of almost like a plate of orange chicken from a Chinese place mixed with a heady kush smell. very citrus smell not too much on the taste tho. more earthy taste with hitns of oranges citrus and sweet. Nice high not to overwhelming but really good for stress and low on the parinoia. would recommend.”"

dasoulfoo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangelo-kush/reviews/1396446,"“Not very vibrant with a green color but it does have good flavor specially when you start coughing up a lung which is a bit bittersweet but after you stop doing that, Its citrusy lingering taste can be felt in the back of your throat which is pretty pleasant as you feel yourself getting Higher. The high is pretty mellow which I enjoy as well. This was a pleasant strain”"

YoungBuckets,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangelo-kush/reviews/1153672,"“The nugs were large,  dense, and citrusy, similar to sour diesel. The taste on the exhale was very fruity and pleasing. Very potent as well! Tons of orange hairs, lovely smell. Very surprised with this strain!”"
