itsallgravy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/carl-sagan/reviews/1272638,"“Carl Sagan is the a great strain the will keep you upbeat.  this is my go to morning strain. Best signature strain. The only place to get the real carl is from top shelf on lake city. Anyone else saying they have it knows someone or is a liar.”"
GMountainMan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/carl-sagan/reviews/1270697,"“Carl Sagan is BY FAR my favorite strain! Smoke a little in the morning and before you know it your house is cleaned, chores are done, and you're feeling great! best sativa strain in my eyes. never lets me down -_-”"

Whispre,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/carl-sagan/reviews/1430539,"“I tried this stain for the arousal aspect. Normally, arousal is not present when im smoking,  so i was curious. 
Well, for me,  it really was.  not just sitting around,  but once touching started,  everything became super sensitive.  
one of my new favorites!”"
almusafir,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/carl-sagan/reviews/1271033,"“Tried it a week ago and had to come back for more!
Easily in my top 10 favourite strains. I feel relaxed but also clear minded and positive. Would recommend highly!”"
grinandbeerit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/carl-sagan/reviews/1318180,"“This stain is wonderful.  I typically smoke it in the evening before bed.  3-4 tokes and my mind stops racing, my pain subsides, and my restless legs stop hurting and moving. unfortunately this isn't an any time of the day smoke for me as it does make me drowsy, so that's the only thing i docked a point for.”"

Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/carl-sagan/reviews/1274537,"“this strain smokes sweet, like you're inhaling whip cream. smooth 8/10 sativa high with Spacey moments, but overall focused on the overall. feels like the bowls go up in steps. 2 bowls is a good creative space to hang out.”"
TheGermiNation,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/carl-sagan/reviews/1142429,"“Visual : Excellent presentation; dense, crystal laden hairy flowers

Smell : Sweetly pungent, earthy and fruity

Flavor : Disarmingly strong lemon taste on the front mellowing out to smoky, piney and woodsy on the back.

Effect : A wonderfully pleasing and mellow yet active cerebral come on, not overwhelming though certainly has couch lock potential.  Good for day time or all around anxiety and mood management.”"
Skullbeary,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/carl-sagan/reviews/1276704,"“Super relaxing and euphoric!! Recommended to us at the Kushery at Cathcart. Grower is The Fruit of the Root, coming in at about 22%. Smells like tropical punch and tasted incredibly sweet, all-around amazing smoke and already in my top 3!”"

Infinity008,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/carl-sagan/reviews/1262184,"“I had this in cartridge form. The high was short, which is great for certain situations. I was able to get some work done without appearing intoxicated, but didn't feel necessarily energized to get more work done that I normally do. Not great before sleeping. Very even, didn't really bring out any personality traits for me (being talkative, laughing, more sociable etc.)”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/carl-sagan/reviews/1489178,"“Carl Sagan by mad Mark is very good. Dried berries, wood, flowers and hash stink off feathery frosty bright neon green nugs with numerous sprawling long bright red hairs. Relaxed moderately in body and very relaxed in mind. A good happiness. Some what of a focus to it, but over do it and focus dissolves into a zone. Smooth smoke with a decent expansion and light cough. Highly recommend all day for the experienced smo...”"
