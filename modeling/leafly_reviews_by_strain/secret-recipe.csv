Nice body buzz and euphoric cerebral high, very introspective, a great balance you would expect from a hybrid. The high THC % was noticeable. Great genetics like Chemdawg and OG Kush”"
paintergirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/secret-recipe/reviews/1331789,"“I enjoyed smoking Secret Recipe in my bong last summer, but never got around to writing a review.  So a few days ago, I picked up an 8th at my favorite shop to give it another go.  After one bowl, my anxiety was through the roof, and I got into an argument with my loved ones.  The issue of the argument wasn't  my fault, but my anxious state didn't help matters.  I gave it another try on another day and was able to en...”"
Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/secret-recipe/reviews/1333005,"“This is some magic here. "shoots me like a rocket into space...loving every minute of it." Comes on hard like sour pebbles strain, or a Tyson punch. Feeling really good, but see how too much magic would curse some peeps. I wouldn't do back to back bowels, unless I was looking to get 2-d animated.”"
poochmarie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/secret-recipe/reviews/1310246,"“If you like Sour Diesel, and long clean highs you should try to get into some of this. 

Potent, and pretty tasty. It is a bud that can roll with whatever your 
choice of activity is. Though it would be a shame to doze off o this one.”"

Feels64,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/secret-recipe/reviews/1255044,"“Very good, strong high. As someone with anxiety issues this strain was a bit hard on me. It gave me a panic attack and I found it difficult to smoke an entire bowl. The taste wasn't as great as I thought it'd be either. The taste is there though, and it's faintly sweet. All in all it has an amazing high and is worth the risk of anxiety.”"

The body and mind high that I got was a great relaxing calming, with a uplifting feeling. Almost like a wright had been lifted off me...It had kind of a earthy taste at first then it became sweet with a bitter kinda sour flavor smell.”"

Lobonai,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/secret-recipe/reviews/1251667,"“This strain is by far my favorite. I love how I get super motivated and creative towards my hobbies. After a good amount of time  of staying productive, I sit for the rest of my high and play video games. I don't think as much like other strains make me, but I do space out a little. I recommend this strain to anyone who hasn't smoked it yet.”"

I bought some flower by Natural Mystic Farms hoping for similar effects.  Instead I was completely zonked out after one small bowl.  I felt heavy and couldn't keep my eyes open.  I had planned on doing a few things before bed, but passed out instead.”"

The first time I thought it might be me, maybe I wasnt in a good mood - but the whole ounce was the same. Might do in a pinch, but it would have to be a pretty tough pinch before I chose this.”"

Dano91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/secret-recipe/reviews/1273590,"“First off this strain is "POTENT" as well simply you may identify OG hints. 50/50 hybrid leaves you with a high that for myself lasts 2-3 hrs, for myself an everyday user, not that we're all alike (take into account and use with ease.) Great taste of citrus, berry comes on strong but easy on the exhale.

A strain I would not hesitate to smoke again.

It left me calm, relaxed, a roused, mindful, peaceful, at ease, creative, and in a quizitive mood. Smell is a sweet fruity, but yet every once in a while it would have a chemical after smell. Taste is fruity, gasoline or earthy like a fresh wet dirt after it rained. Its a hearty flower it burned slowly.”"
