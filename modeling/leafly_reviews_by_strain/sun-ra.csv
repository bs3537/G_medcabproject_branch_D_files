My eyes were not blood shot .... in fact as I write this review I am still feeling good pretty good.... I am able to function at work... speak properly... even through a few jokes here and there...”"

By far the best strain to do upbeat activities on. I smoked just a little, then went on a walk of downtown Denver. needless to say it's absolutely amazing!”"

But I'm definitely gonna give this medicine a 5 star rating for sure!!!! This post is coming from a veteran Cannabis user!!! Give this strain a try you won't regret it”"
