Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-dragon/reviews/1409914,"“This is some of the best bud I've smoked in a long while. I knew after looking at the dense and gorgeous looking nugs that this was grade-A devil's lettuce, but was definitely not expecting it to bring me into rapture. The symptoms creep one by one: uplifted, euphoric, giggly respectively. I smoke weed every day and was getting tired of some of the not-so-potent bud I was inhaling, so Blue Dragon was extremely refres...”"

If you are anything like me and have a high tolerance, this is the perfect strain for you. It doesn't take much to get the effects to hit you. It is very smooth and satisfying to take a hit of no matter if it's a joint, blunt, bowl, or bong. The effects are long lasting and fantastic. Highly recommended for an everyday smoker.”"
bekkah420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-dragon/reviews/1409915,"“Just tried it for the first time, literally as im writing this. The first two hits were very tasty, heavy berry and almost earthy flavors really stick with you. 
 I find it's a bit of a creeper, it kicked in a little at first, but around 5 minutes later all of my muscles relaxed, relieving some of my chronic back pain from an injury and scar tissue pain on my belly from my hysterectomy 8 months ago. This would have b...”"

This is a quick hitter, and the moment it hits you nothing but happiness.  These buds are not purple like the description states.  Left me feeling worry free and energetic for hours, my wife was surprised by how much house work I spontaneously did when she got home.”"

Normally I'm the kind of guy who prefers variety to his meds, but with blue dragon, I don't even feel the need to. It's by far one of my favorite strains ever ! Long lasting, creative, euphoric, happy, awesome high. lasts for quite some time. I love this bud! GET SOME NOW!”"

This was some good stuff, the name attracted me because I like the color blue, I only bought a joint at the shop, then smoked it with my buddy, with just that one small joint we were both good for a while.

a much harsher than expected smoke, with a very subtle blueberry hint. It hits hard with an amazing head-rush which in turn creates a happy, talkative high.”"
