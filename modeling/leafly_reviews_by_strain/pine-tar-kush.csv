A THC buzz is all Autonomic...happy, hungry, horny, sleepy, rapid heart rate and so on. This is the first strain that I've tried and actually able to handle. I can't smoke due to lung damage from a genetic blood clotting disorder. I decarboxilate it and eat a bit. Within 45 minutes I'm pain f...”"

DrRedEyez,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pine-tar-kush/reviews/1220650,"“This is one hard hitting Indica!  Wow! It caught me off guard after my 3rd toke from my cone joint.  Didn't see the intial head high coming, and boy did it hit me .  Great cerebral buzz in the beginning, then a nice body high after.  Helped me relax after my physio and gym exercises.   The pain will disappear and you will be left with a nice overall exceptional high.   A very soothing high to experience, however don'...”"
jessicakristint,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pine-tar-kush/reviews/1274856,"“Gave me a head high that I wasn't anticipating from an indica, but it gave me a nice body buzz as well. The strain I picked up from Emerald Feilds in Manitou Springs had about 18% THC, pretty high for an indica. Not sure if I would use this one this for insomnia as the head high could keep you up thinking.”"

ConceptProductions,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pine-tar-kush/reviews/1500419,"“Pine Tar kush is a new strain to me, that I found at one of my go-to dispensaries. 

On a side note, the place where i obtained this sample was always my number 2 spot, but now that my favorite dispensary has closed/relocated, I only have 1 or 2 places to choose from until I find out their new address.

By the time I got to the dispensary, the pine tar kush jar was almost empty, so i only grabbed a few grams, and got...”"

The first thing you will notice is how resinous the buds are by how sticky they feel when pulling them apart.  When you first inhale the thick smoke, there will be a little skunkiness in the odor. The taste is earthy yet very smooth.  One of the immediate effects I felt was the uplifting cerebal buzz (not what I would expect from an Indica) but...”"

I decided to try vaping it, on my first try. The initial plan was to smoke up while writing the review. I’ll be honest, I was so mellowed out that I looked at my phone and said fuck it.

Although I didn’t get the heavy eyes effect I was looking for, I received a pleasant body buzz ...”"

RedVans,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pine-tar-kush/reviews/1661405,"“Top indica for me. I smoked a bowl of this and I got sucked into the couch which soon became my bed because it made me so sleepy. No feelings of anxiety or paranoia. 

Night time smoke for me. Large amounts will send you deep into the couch.

Crodz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pine-tar-kush/reviews/1532739,"“This Strain was just meh for me. At best. The smell was very piney, and berry-like. The Buds themselves were a gorgeous purple, and dense as all Hell. Look and smell-wise, I was super impressed, and even loved the very heavy berry taste of the smoke and vape clouds. Where the Strain lacked for me was the actual high. I was expecting much more of a body punch but was left with a better head high than body high, which ...”"

Nothing special in terms of look, but it is a great looking bud that's fairly dense. Of course the scent will manifest itself as pine and wood, but had a pleasant sweet undertone as well. Smoke was, surprisingly, on the smoother side. Once the high creeps up on you, a world of relaxation is at your feet. Classic indica effects but not extremely potent, so i...”"
