=============
OnlytheFinestGreen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1388409,"“This is one of the best strains I've ever tried. It allows me to relax and mellow out very effectively without getting paranoid. I also feel more focused, creative and aware when taking it.”"
tinyhands,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1385754,"“Galactic Jack has reserved my education regarding the ability to read or comprehend information in a logical manner. 

Other than that, tuna casserole.”"
surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1334227,"“Delivers a wonderful, stimulating buzz. Provides excellent pain relief and sooths my aching tummy. Tastes delicious and fruity yet when exhaling I tasted notes of pine and an earthy sweetness. 

Mind free
Pain gone
Energy engaged 
Overall top shelf breeding”"
gatorhunts420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1332434,"“Love love this medical strain! So tasty. If you've grown both parents you can see the space queen influence. The color of purplish pink. Fully covered in tricomes. It's a day time use for most but beware cause it's also known to be couch lock also. I personally am watching Hamilton's Pharmacopoeia on fish and trip...smoked a .8 or a g joint. Enjoy immensely ,dry eyes tho. Great change of pace after a hectic thanksgiv...”"
LongBeachHippies,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1313043,"“This strain is one of the best my girlfriend is a big fan of the jacks and they are great in many ways. But something was different about GALACTIC JACK 😳 With its sweet sweet taste and earthy flavors that just brings out the best in it and a great skunk aroma as well. This strain is great for a great outdoor hike or and a very active and productive effect and great body high as well.”"
KristinaKinda,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1361461,"“one of my favorite sativas. I'm a daily medical user for flowers and wouldn't recommend this to novice users because  it's a very heavy hitting sativa (paranoia and general jumpiness). Got a lot done though because it is very energetic. I would recommend for morning use if you have a lot of easy relaxing things to get done. not the best for pain relief although it offers some.”"
Thunderjet86,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1375003,"“Thanks to Galactic Jack, I now know why my Converse sneakers have felt on the bottom. And my oh my, that's something interesting I'll tell you what. I'm not going to spoil it and tell you, but you should look it up. Turn on the Internet and stoke up one of those Googles you've been talking about.”"
bosieboy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1251044,"“A whole lot of energy without anxiety or paranoia. This is a great "get going" strain. Hits fast, lasts a while. This is a very heady high.If I accidentally get too much, I get a headache or a little dizzy, so be careful if you're sativa sensitive. While I'm usually an indica/hybrid smoker, this is nice for depressed days.”"
Forestfire420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1233944,"“Great sativa to smoke. Has a nice grapefruit taste and isn't harsh. The high is very mellow compared to other sativa dominate strains. Fifty fold does a great job on all there flower they grow. Definitely recommend to the daily smoker with a novice to veteran tolerance level.”"

gatorhunts420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1256589,"“This female is the biggest in the room. .holy shit the budz are fucking huge. .just watch the tricomes development from early week 2 till the end just thought they wouldn't stop lol...getting some color from the space Queen. ..and the shatter it makes is just phenomenal. ..all up buzz and flavor for days long lasting”"
franki4fingers,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1375004,"“Pretty good. Genealogy is an interesting mix, with its father being my fav. The description is very accurate. Uplifting, carefree and focused. Most definitely a hybrid. While it feels to be sativa dominant, high dosages will no doubt have you at best couch locked if not sleep.”"
musicwizard,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1417780,"“This one is pretty great. Especially for hanging out on weekends. I got absolutely no paranoia on this one. It's very easy going, very chill. It's mostly just like Jack Herer with an extra little spacey cerebral kick, with more visual stimulation. It lasts a nice long time, with a slow, steady come-down, but it does make me a bit drowsy and moody when it wears off.”"
jenlikesramen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1541058,"“Large pretty buds, classic Jack scent, with a potent space-y high. Like, zoning out, sometimes creativity-inducing, sometimes introspective. Never too racy for those who don’t like the usual Jack high.”"
QuietGenius,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1332435,"“The flowers were nice and smelled like sweet red grapefruit. The citrus was stank-tacular. Not leafy at all & not too dense, very easy to break down with your fingers. I didn't see any sticks or stems. The high kicks in right away. I was in the kitchen happy AF!”"
Masshero,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1188292,"“Just a caveat: I'm no connoisseur, I'm content smoking ditch weed. 

This strain was tasty and strong as hell. It immediately put me on my ass. I was almost drooling. I don't quite know how to review a strain on the different categories such as "happy" "energetic" "talkative" etc. I felt much more stoned than when smoking the normal run of the mill marijuana I usually sample. Definitely had a minty twinge to the tast...”"

BvanPDX,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/galactic-jack/reviews/1213550,"“How do you not love a Sativa with Jack Herer and Space Queen.
