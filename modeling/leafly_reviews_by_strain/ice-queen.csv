Takes bout 10 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. I can't say no anxiety as my disorder has been outta control lately. But this strain helped me function when I felt like I was losing my mind. In the literal sense. So thank Jesus, dis strain works! Body high allowed me to eat dinner & pass out after da strain wore off 3+...”"

I have recently been only dabbing everyday for the last year and a half, everyday all day like Nick Swardson. For awhile many "awesome" strains have come and gone but none that really hit me like Ice Queen. Two dabs of relatively large size within thirty minutes of each other, makes you hesitant to do the third. This strain is a long lasting, strong sativa dominant hybrid that leaves your whole body feeling y...”"

The body buzz starts in the eyes and forehead, moving its way downward throughout your body with a floaty, tingling sensation while lifting you upward physically, mentally, and emotionally; No couch lock here. 

Then, a swell of euphoria and a beautiful emotional awareness that spurs creative clarit...”"

trschnei,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-queen/reviews/1216068,"“This strain gives an extreme amount of energy. Everyone that has tried it ends up doing ninja style air punching and jumping on the trampoline. Great for a morning session with coffee to get motivation for the day! The smell is wonderful.. a fruity/piney. Beautiful covered with white crystals and blue/purp leaves.”"
mammabear91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-queen/reviews/1289321,"“just tried this for the first time and it's awesome! I can definitely smell the rose& lavender. the taste isn't too bad (I've had waaay worse). I used a bong and definitely felt the effect the first hit. relaxing but more uplifting. I can function throughout the day after smoking this and not glued to the sofa. highly recommended.”"

Head high is really strong but doesn't get to the point where it feels like your face is shrinking in on itself, which is great for being able to focus on whatever you're doing.
Talking can be a bit difficult, at least for me, as my mind wanders a lot from topic to topic, making maintaining a conv...”"

Works wonders on my anxiety and is loud enough to get me talking about aliens and get me in that deep state of mine that blows people's mind, but not worrying about what people think of me (I usually take Clonazepam for my anxiety, this will get me off of it!!).”"
