mirageasti,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earthquake/reviews/1368010,"“Definitely a must try for veteran smokers. Me and my friends call these type of strains "creepers" where the high will keep building up.

Superb earthy taste and smell, and am currently baked like a hot bun from 2 bong hits, and its still building up.

It gives a very clear, focused and euphoric high, which is perfect for outdoor trips, enjoying nature or just basking in your own environment.”"
