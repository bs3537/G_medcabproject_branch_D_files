TheFinchOfTime,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/damnesia/reviews/1280174,"“Lovely little high, earthy with a hint of black pepper and spice aftertaste. Very uplifting and energizing, though if you smoke/vape a significant amount you can get quite lost in the tangental thoughts the weed encourages. Overall, though, a very enjoyable and relaxing high.”"

After the break i started with a few harder strains which got me anxious again. But this strain flipped it! Smoked it 2 days ago in Amsterdam and i'm feelin real good! You don't feel it that hard. You just feel balanced, no faster heart rate and your thoughts are clear!”"

1/2 star off for awful dry mouth tho. Never had it worse.”"
