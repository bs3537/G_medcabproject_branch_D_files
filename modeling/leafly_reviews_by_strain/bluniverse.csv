I smoke this before writing, get a blast of creativity within 10 minutes or so, and do some of the best writing ever. When the sativa high starts to wane I get the relaxing calm of Blue Magoo (another of my favorites).

On another note, very smooth flavor. Smells strongly of blueberries when you open the bag. Nice, quick high. Love it!”"
NerdyMo420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bluniverse/reviews/1389755,"“Very good hybrid with a delicious earthy blueberry taste. The high is nicely balanced between physical relaxation and uplifting euphoria. Does excellent at treating stress, depression, and ADD. You are in a happy, relaxed, focused state, everything seems better!”"

harless428,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bluniverse/reviews/1331670,"“Amazing for blunts. If smokes slow, crisp with a great flavor. I smoked a blunt and a bowl with this strain and I'm not opposed to smoking bowls with this strain but the blunt was over the edge. It was awesome, it made me very paranoid though, thought the cops were coming for sure. Plus I ate everything in my refrigerator”"

DreamBlueDream,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bluniverse/reviews/1277220,"“This strain is consistent. For me, It is paranoia free. I think Luda know what he talking bout when he say blue berry yum yum. Bl7niverse is oviously simular to the Blue berry strain.”"
Chronfucius,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bluniverse/reviews/1638373,"“Blue Magoo is one of my all time favorite strains - has a fragrance akin to Afghooey, sweet with a distinct lack of “stank.” Bluniverse continues the hereditary tradition with a wonderful smell, taste to match, and an uplifting high.
