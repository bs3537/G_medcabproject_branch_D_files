"Blue Moonshine is a powerful Indica plant, that produces highs that are similar to the effect produced by hash. In fact for growers looking to make good hash this is a good plant to start with. The name of this strain was reportedly coined in a dream.

Blue Moonshine is related to the White Widow strain family. That's partly why the buds are so dense and c...”"
Snarkey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-moonshine/reviews/1350647,"“This is the strain that I needed to help me sleep. I have chronic insomnia and anxiety. I have been on sleeping meds for a long time that didn't put me into deep sleep. 

Vaping one hit gave me just what I needed to sleep deeply, something I haven't had in a few years. Also, one hit was just enough to not get me paranoid, but just enough so I am happy and am able to sleep the whole night.”"
tchapman04,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-moonshine/reviews/1361662,"“As a rule I tend to prefer sativa strains but Blue Moonshine really made me rethink my stance on indicas. As mentioned it's very potent and so it's easy to wind up couch locked but it relaxes your whole body to the point where even if you could move you wouldn't be any to. It really helped with my back pain too, I'd highly recommend this strain to most.”"

(4 grams at $8 a gram on sale) This strain greets you like a fine wine with its pungent sweet smell, then when you crack these dense spungy buds the blueberry is released as if a burst berry itself - the smoke is heavy, tasting of cotton candy, but not overwhelmingly harsh which pars well with the effects of ...”"

I get the same cool with anything type of high with a bit more giggly effects. very satisfied with this strain, and however much i despise indica's, this strain seems to have minimal chances of couch lock. 

Im happy :)”"

I of course chose a VERY strong indica but took it slow.
Took 1 hit and it took about 2 minutes to hit.
