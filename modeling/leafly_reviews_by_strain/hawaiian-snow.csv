I'm a Hawaiian Tour-Guide, surfer, and outdoorsman who is always on the move. So, I look for pure sativas that get me going in the morning, and relieve all and any pain, due to the high CBD.

Hawaiian snow provides a focused and uplifting effect accompanied with a subtle euphoria.

Nonetheless, I will say that the green is exquisite. It got my friend and I very baked in very little time; 0.5 in 5mins and we are higher than Armstrong. 

The taste is sweet, the smoke is crisp and the color is superb. 

I would highly recommend this strain.”"
