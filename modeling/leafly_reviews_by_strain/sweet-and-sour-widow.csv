stingo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-and-sour-widow/reviews/1398896,"“After suffering from anxiety attacks, which turned into depression, I reached out and got my hands on some Sweet and Sour Widow for its CBD effects. An hour after smoking, I felt the anxiety, stress, and depression, lift and float away out the open window. The room felt brighter, everything felt better, and I saw my problems for what they were - temporary. Didn't need much of this at all for it to completely relax bo...”"

I've been able to cut my pharmacological meds in half after using this for a month, and hope to get off them entirely soon.  The only downside is that if I take it too late I'm fuzzy headed in the morning, but a dose of sativa fixes that:-)”"

I bought a JuJu Joint in the "Sweet Sour Widow" strain, and zero joke... two hits took my anxiety away completely.  Very slight high, but felt more relaxed and much better if anything.  "Highly" recommend ;)”"
sjclark,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-and-sour-widow/reviews/1363220,"“This is great for relaxation, happiness, and anxiety. It leaves me clear headed, NOT hungry, and still able to sleep when i am ready. My favorite so far.”"
ChestyMcDeathrack,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-and-sour-widow/reviews/1375795,"“Fantastic CBD strain.  It really matters who grows and processes her.  I have had a not outstanding batch of flower, that was September of this year.  My earlier review was "meh", but I can tell you, she has potential for greatness.  The batch I got for my Man and I on Christmas from Best Buds is lovely.  She has a great depth of flavor, especially when vaped, is soothing and calming but not sedating, and clear-heade...”"

I have Fibromyalgia and often need help with sleep, managing pain, etc. Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience with Sweet and Sour Widow. I've tried this strain a few times now, and each time I would take about 3 hit...”"

Qman1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-and-sour-widow/reviews/1351345,"“After ingesting this strain you will be transported to a euphoric place. Very much a head high that slowly advances to the rest of the body. perfect strain to use for productivity which is unusual for an indica. very good at treating insomina, loss of appetite etc. recommended 😎”"

StonerRockGod,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-and-sour-widow/reviews/1351342,"“This strain is VERY very relaxing, mainly due to it's 1:1 THC/CBD ratio this strain provides an extremely calm "body high" with a nice stoney head high that can leave you in a couch lock if you toke more than 3-4g. the flavor is very earthy with a mellow citrus and the smell is phenomenally piney with an almost ceder inhale. 

Absolutely one of my all time favorite strains!”"

Completely dissolved my terrible anxiety, while giving me energy at the same time. I like that I can use this during the day without worrying about being in a couch-lock state.”"

I have extreme anxiety and  within moments of smoking this I was sitting and smiling at the moon - not a care in the world.  It feels like all your stress floats away and is replaced with a light peacefulness unrivalled by any strain I’ve ever tried.  I immediately felt as though I had entered a hallowed place - there was a cool cle...”"

ChestyMcDeathrack,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-and-sour-widow/reviews/1209698,"“Really tasty, and went well with dinner.  Not exactly what I'm looking for, but totally decent.  Really good for back pain, not as much for headache.  The intractable headache is what I'm looking to treat.  Very, very relaxing.  Would be good for hangover days or rainy nights.  Also a good romantic bud *wink wink*”"

highsethjohnson,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-and-sour-widow/reviews/1610861,"“Tried this strain, the high kind of crept up on me.

EwanIndikey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-and-sour-widow/reviews/1687094,"“Then this is the best strain of MaryJane among all according to me. To be honest I'm sure than in 10 years there will be a lot of better strains in the world but for the moment nothing is better than this absolutely perfect blend between the sour and pungent taste of the smoke and this big stone on the forehead which lasts for the maximum time possible (!). Honestly I don't expect much for a MaryJane strain than what...”"
