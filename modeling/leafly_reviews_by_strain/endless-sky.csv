Endless Sky

TwistedD,https://www.leafly.com/indica/endless-sky/reviews/1184123,"“Endless Sky really knocked me on my ass, in terms of potency, taste, and effect. The high is a strong, blunt blow to the middle of the face when it hits, and lasts for upwards of three hours. It gives a very clear high, allowing for you to do all of the things you'd normally try to do. The taste is an almost mango fruit mix, while the aftertaste is reminiscent of lemon. The nug forms very well, creating a high bud-to...”"
SuperGenetics,https://www.leafly.com/indica/endless-sky/reviews/1062285,"“Endless Sky seemed like a suspicious bud at  first glance, it smelt very delicious like mangoes and berries but it looked dark and ordinary. To my surprise this budget friendly pick was amazing. It tastes smooth, sweet and then fruity, with undertones of tropical fruits, citrus and berries. Nice euphoric high, dreamy and mellow.”"

I have 40+ years experience growing and using cannabis, a masters degree in agri/horticulture from MSU and will break each review down as follows from my own personal experience with seeds or clones obtained directly from the original breeders: First I have to start out by saying that this and most strains from Greenthumb are complete shots in the dark as far as consistency. You can get 10 Femin...”"
MaverickR,https://www.leafly.com/indica/endless-sky/reviews/1256265,"“Smokes amazing, it's so smooth. Large buds with lots of hairs, not the greatest looking and the smell is really good but not very strong. My bag smelled alot like berries or mango but the taste was more buttery. Very potent for the price,kicks in pretty quick and is a great indica spacey and euphoric high.”"
GYMP,https://www.leafly.com/indica/endless-sky/reviews/1199963,"“Some say after a full dose of Endless Sky, they don't feel high. Few of those in my personal smoking circle use Cannabis to reap its full medicinal attributes. I do. Yes, I understand why the high is not right away felt. That's aoll well and good; however, I stand behind this strain for the medicinal benefits Endless Sky has in store.”"
EricLovesgreen21,https://www.leafly.com/indica/endless-sky/reviews/1369423,"“Loved this strain.  instant top 5 for me.  Very smooth inhale with a spiced fruit exhale.  I highly recommend.  A little goes a long way with this heavy-hitter so it’s also easy on your wallet if you’re on a budget…. 

Always try to smile throughout your day.  You will notice more people smiling back.    -E”"

goodbyeEarth2016,https://www.leafly.com/indica/endless-sky/reviews/1318286,"“A solid indica strain with a very unique flavor, in this batch at least the buttery flavor dominant. Has a rather intense body high but leaves you surpisingly functional.”"

Irievibes420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/endless-sky/reviews/1442012,"“This bud definitely lives up to its name. Only smoked one small nug not even half a gram and was intergalactic cosmic higher than a Martian fart high for at least 3 hours! If you want your mind to leave on a jet plane roll up a paper plane of this stuff and enjoy your flight.”"
GYMP,https://www.leafly.com/indica/endless-sky/reviews/1335816,"“Living in Oklahoma, variety is limited. I packed my pipe with this strain (1 of 2 I procured earlier; the other Sage & Sour). Without going into my list of medical history and all that bjazz, I will say that wheelchairs tense  your muscles after sitting in them for so long and that both tighten your muscles and compromises the skeletal structure. The little bag it came in came alive as I moved the bud into its new ja...”"
SmoggyMc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/endless-sky/reviews/1137459,"“I saw this weed and it looks like crap let's be honest. but as soon as I vape it I got a very thick, heavy vape. Tasting sweet but still not a juicy sweet. Very impressed on how quickly it knocked me out, And I usually smoke/vape a indica. Over all not my favorite indica but a very good bud if you want to sleep tight and cozy..... with a slight head rush.”"
LeafyFinds,https://www.leafly.com/indica/endless-sky/reviews/1184015,"“Extremely potent with great night time effects but I don't agree with some other reviews that state it should be strictly for night time use. Perfect clarity in the high in the sense I could still partake in all my daily actives and chores. Made me very talkative and creative would highly recommend for public situations or times you may want to strike up a conversion for a productive outcome. If you have need for cre...”"

GYMP,https://www.leafly.com/indica/endless-sky/reviews/1302748,"“Someone else reviewed it with an emphatic, "A shot in the dark!!!". I live in Okla. so I rarely come across variety to choose from. When I do, I havel little-to-no time for research before cash already switched hands. I didhave”"
