It's grown with the insanely fine and vigilant care that Pioneer Nuggets always delivers. Blueberry Silvertip has a distinctly "Blue" and sweet aroma to it, mixed with a sage/pine scent; it smokes smooth, and tastes very sweet and fruity. Best for when you're having a bad ...”"

DonutHolschtien,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1351585,"“Upon the first hit, you will be engulfed into a HEAVY head high within seconds, followed by a comfy, relaxing body high about 20-30 minutes in. Very nice high overall. 

The scent is really unique: primarily a fruity lavender, but with slight musky and earthy undertones. Not very pungent, but a rather mild smell, with the tiniest hints of the kush from one of its parent plants, Montana Silvertip. 

The flavor is pred...”"

foofeefog,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1542429,"“The batch I got was tested at 29% thc 1.6% cbd, which I feel like is higher than the norm for this strain grown by pioneer nugs. I was thinking it might hit me like a ton of bricks so I really eased into it and wow. This was probably one of the nicest highs I have ever had. Came on almost instantly and kept me in an even heady and body state for most the evening watching Planet Earth 2. Maybe it was the animals and s...”"

Batholith,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1412729,"“Love this - anxiety gets destroyed with the BBST. Good body effects as well. Lower back pain is reduced by a good margin. Definitely don't plan active stuff or working, though - it's time to chill😎”"
macNcheesed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1351319,"“I got thick blueberry flavored hits from this one. Very uplifting/happy, good mix of a body and head high. Pretty focused and engaged until the 2 hour mark and it's lights out!”"

firefly887,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1536034,"“This strain just recently hit the dispensary in a Curaleaf slim as Indigo. I was excited to try it after being told the real name at the dispensary (come on and update the database Dabbin Dad!) since it seems like you can never go wrong with a Blueberry strain. This didn’t disappoint me. It brings a focused, uplifting head high with a really relaxing body high that’s not too heavy. I can see this being a good one for...”"

Lots of body high and relaxation, makes the head feel fuzzy and blah, but also a bit introspective?

mab,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1295225,"“Great euphoric high while remaining pretty chill. Definitely a hybrid feeling to it, but leaning slightly more towards sativa. Wouldn't want to do it at night, but it also isn't going to inspire me to clean the garage. Good Saturday afternoon choice.”"
alsalamoney,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1333323,"“I reacted totally different than anyone. I'm probably going to stay away from due to horrible headache post high.

The final goal of sleep was achieved but the journey there was not pleasurable”"
musicslug,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1356292,"“this strain was more energizing than I typically expect from a hybrid; it might be due to its potency - my sample was 24% THC. I wouldn't call it 'jittery' (like green crack or cinex), but I was practically vibrating. fortunately, the sativa-like energizing effect wasn't accompanied by any tendency toward getting too caught up in my thoughts. one additional plus for this one: both times that I've tried it, there was ...”"
JRD913,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1741211,"“I like it but it definitely leans on the sativa side and I thought it would lean towards an indica for me. I smoked it and it kept me up and with the munchies. 😂 I wasn’t anxious at all and I have a lot of anxiety just couldn’t sleep at all. Now that I know that I wouldn’t use it before bed again.”"
Clearskye527,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1295449,"“A bit of cerebral and body feeling. No couch which is a plus for daytime use. Helps with anxiety and creates an appetite! Still loving the original Silvertip more though but definitely a 2nd best!”"

Soc23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1754743,"“I did like four hits from a joint. I was told it is like sunburn, which I'm great with. This strain messed me up. first extreme nausea coinciding with a rapid heart rate, tingling in the left part of my lips, left a side of my face, warm chest and back. I walked for 2 hours and drank 3 bottles of water and took 1 ml of cbd oil before the effect wore off. Silvertip is not the same as Blueberry Silvertip or Sunburn.”"

Pretty420milkiss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-silvertip/reviews/1750074,"“But...someone, please, set me straight. My neighborhood disp only labels it as Silvertip. Do all Silvertip strains provide the same type of heady, happy effects? It was also suggested that it may be too energetic for one prone to high energy...any input would be appreciated as I haven't determined this yet for sure.”"
