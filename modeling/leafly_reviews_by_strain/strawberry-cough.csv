I have anxiety very often and this strain is one of the only strains that helps me with it. Strawberry cough (strawberry fields x haze) is the best tasting strain I have ever had ,and I am not joking or exaggerating when I say that. From the first inhalation I can taste the strawberry flavor that reminds me of the strawberry patches that grew at my childhood ...”"

The affects in low doses include clear head high, uplifted, energetic, alerting, focused, sociable, relaxed and a little giggly. The only body high you get with low amounts is small little tingles on botto...”"

The pharmaceutical drugs I were taking were not improving the quality of my life and had too many adverse side effects.  I heard Strawbery Cough was specifically designed as an anti-anxiety medical marijuana strain, so I thought I would give it a try.

The fine folks at Rocky Mountain Remedies were extolling the virtues of this fine strain and I was not disappointed.

Immensely happy and I've had a couple fits of laughter -- I'm just coming of a week of Fruity Pebbles/MOB and the difference in my mood is palpable. So far I haven't been screwed by the munchies and that's a big plus for me. I would rate the bag appearance 3/10 but this buzz is certainly 5 star.
