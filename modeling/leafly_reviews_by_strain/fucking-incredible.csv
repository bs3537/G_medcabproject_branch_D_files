Earthy, herbal, smooth and fragrant at the exhale, a one hitter I thought was too little, but in the end, was just right.

Perhaps my major complaint is my back is killing me because I renovated my front and backyard with this strain.  Every morning a bong load with a cup of coffee was fucking incredible.

It is a beautiful fluffy green, and so soft. the taste is incredible and smokes super smooth. It seems to be a sneaky high, but doesn't give me couch-lock like many other Indicas do, which is nice. Pretty decent for pain relief and anxiety.”"
leahwaz73,https://www.leafly.com/indica/fucking-incredible/reviews/1397714,"“I heard people talking about this strain while standing in line on 4/20 and decided to give it a try. The bud was pretty sticky, with an earthy and slightly skunky aroma and pine on the exhale.
