The flavor is strong and like amoniac. 
You won't get the so high, so you can do it in the day.”"
mrdirkdiggler,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/arctic-sun/reviews/1254260,"“Good mix of up and down. Doesn't last overly long, but I prefer that. Came sticky, got crumbly in about a week and a half.”"
TangerineGirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/arctic-sun/reviews/1278704,"“mild high, good for day use. slight creative influences, too.”"

Not a very energetic high more of a head rush but not a couch lock either.. Keeping this for those strange cold nights”"

I could go run a mile or take a nap depending on which I pursued. decent taste, but burns a lot compared to other strains.. decent for day time use if you have stuff to do - no effects of couch lock”"
