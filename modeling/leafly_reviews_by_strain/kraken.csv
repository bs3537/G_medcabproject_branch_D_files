yogaveritas,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1378446,"“This is quickly becoming a new favorite. Super potent indica that transcends you to deep relaxation without knocking you unconscious. Added bonus in that it doesn't give me the munchies like most of the others do.”"
TheDawgUW,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1315351,"“This powerful strain will release a euphoric burst of energy from the moment of impact.  You will then be subdued by a deep and enriching cerebral experience that will leave you forgetting previous thoughts and removed from the surrounding environment.  This crystal-covered flower is preferred for early evenings when you have nothing left to do in the day.”"
PurpleHurricane,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1361094,"“This strain will give you the munchies!!! I'm eating way too much right now. I felt a bit paranoid at one point, but quickly died down. I started wanting to expand my knowledge and wanted to know the meaning behind everything. A great strain if you want to be more creative and focus also!”"
Wilson40841,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1733188,"“I don’t usually get down on the purple side, but this stuff is FIRE.  Grapefruit is my 1st love, but this is a serious side piece.  Warning, gives you the mad munchies.”"
Marcoparacone,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1275329,"“Kraken got me a very happy high, and also it tasted kinda spicy, which I really liked”"
Lordwashingv,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1344081,"“An acetone note initially when you smell the flowers. Clean aroma ones broken down the tricombs seem to balance the weight of this Indica”"
cturne04,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1363819,"“This is an amazing indica. Doesn't make me knock out immediately. It's more of a just happy high.”"
RedVans,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1699641,"“This one had me super chatty, uplifted, happy and the giggles were on point. It also couched me, had my eyes feeling super heavy and before long I was falling asleep. A perfect night time strain.”"

Arkelao,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1477134,"“Great relaxing strain, perfect when you have a lot of stress, headaches and stuff. Very smooth, very slow high, never too much, perfect for board games night or even work in creative projects. One of my favourites.”"
nomad3812,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1374119,"“affects come in quick. a total sense of relaxation, especially behind the eyes and in the head. although a real potent indica i havent felt the urge to sleep, just relax and chill on the couch.”"
Extrezy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1247915,"“Good taste very good, i get so high from this, i forget where iam.”"

Dingy13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1302339,"“This is a really good road trip strain. The music is euphoric, probably good for a novice smoker. This would help a notice somewhat test the waters with Indica.”"
DarioRed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1245181,"“this strain was amazing”"
Supra97,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1637568,"“I enjoyed a nice relaxing high without feeling too much appetite, not too sleepy overall. Very pleasant, able to focus on tasks with ease.”"
Ev_angeline,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1617635,"“This stuff kicks my ass to sleep. It's crazy. I would definitely recommend this for insomniacs. Such dense, crystal coats nugs. Must be the most crystally weed I have ever seen, come to think of it... gassy, earthy smell... gorgeous bag appeal 

If you are a seasoned smoker, or a novice who wants to fly to the moon, give Kraken a try! Great for relaxing before bed, about an hour into the buzz of total relaxation your...”"
yournotmydad,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1578963,"“Very buttery, especially on the aftertaste. Made my legs numb. The body stone, anxiety and stress relief is incredible. Took a pretty tiny dab too so I would likely be passed out if I took a normal sized one.”"
RedVans,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1699641,"“This one had me super chatty, uplifted, happy and the giggles were on point. It also couched me, had my eyes feeling super heavy and before long I was falling asleep. A perfect night time strain.”"
Polecatt613,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1667635,"“Think of this strain like a strong kush with more of a complex high. Smells and tastes like dank kush with other flavors that are hard to describe.”"
MisterMeSeeks92,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1706806,"“In my opinion its really hard on the indica side, I got more of a body high that just made me tired, and not want to do anything, although I prefer hybrids and sativa dominant strains, this stuff was good, but not very productive, I didn't receive any of the uplifting effects just heavy bogged down and lazy.”"
harless428,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kraken/reviews/1359368,"“3.75/5 
I finally found this strain after I heard a ton of people raving over it. When I got it I was so ready to get ripped off a bowl or two but it didn't happen. It tastes great, smokes amazing but doesn't have a very high thc content. 
Idk I could have a higher tolerance right now.”"
