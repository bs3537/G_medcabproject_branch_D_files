I am in awe of this beautiful plant.  Much love to Purple Caper for their tireless work on and dedication to breeding great medicine.

I thought I wasn't even high then about 20 min after smoking I was hit with a huge wave of euphoria and a major couch lock that made me so lazy. This helps so much for SA and GAD, it's unbelievable. Also fantastic for depression. Very chill bud, similar but better than xanax for sure”"
LilSnoopDOG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-cookies/reviews/1385509,"“On my first drag the inhale was smooth and did have hint of grape. Before I finished I was baked af and got lost outside my house. Finally make it inside and the body High kicked in. My body was buzzing and my head felt warm. Very euphoric feeling and made me laugh a lot. I recommend smoking with someone else. The smell was quite strong but nice.”"
bigbluefan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-cookies/reviews/1391326,"“Very happy. Has taken edge off some pain and really helping with anxiety and spasms. Tastes great. Calming high. I am so thankful CT saw the light and offered medical marijuana to patients who so desperately need it. I will be on certain meds my entire life but marijuana has allowed me to stop taking prescribed sleep aides and 1 of my break through narcotic painkillers. My mood and energy levels are much better since...”"

After that everything felt slow motion while time was moving normally. Later I looked up and there were stars everywhere and they were moving off the ceiling. 100% recommend.”"
ecsdjay,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-cookies/reviews/1384732,"“Buds super dense (hydro) basically dipped in Thc. Coated. I don't get hung up about piurp but it is purp looking for sure. Buzz is happy, relaxed, loose vibe. Flavor has a grape/ fruity meets mild skunky thing. Pretty nice smoke!”"

As soon as i was able to smoke ,I was able to get my paws on this Bad Boy. The aroma was rich coffee and grape infused with a mix of jet fuel. This rocked hit me by the 3rd toke, I was so relaxed...”"

np1115,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-cookies/reviews/1525615,"“Grape Cookies: Good indica for getting a nice buzz in the evening. Good way to put you to sleep if you want to use it for that purpose. Don’t use in the morning.

The high from this strain is consistently intense and focused laser beam. It will keep going into the day from the night before. While this strain does help with sleep, it is recommended to use a sativa in the morning, since this will burn off any residual ...”"

It's New Year's Eve and I was the only one on my team at work today and got a lot done, and that felt good.  We always go home early the day before a holiday, so I did, and I'm sipping on a strong IPA as I make my way to the 6th bowl of Grape Cookies to commence my New Year's Eve festivities at home with my cats.

IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-cookies/reviews/1390353,"“Another amazing GSC cross, one of the best I've tried. Right up there with Gelato and Sunset Sherbet for me, especially in the look and scent. Sweet grape and hints of a GSC/OG type dank scent underneath and the taste matches it spot on. Perfect frosty purple nugs you almost feel bad breaking apart. Super uplifting relaxing with a wide range of effects to match a numbing body buzz. Makes whatever you're doing better ...”"
