Silver Pearl
=============
JackDanieL,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1390413,"“Silver Pearl is a beautiful flower, a sativa dominant hybrid with just enough of an indica kick to sit you down.  My batch came in small to medium sized nugz that literally stuck to the LID of the jar.  Bustling with a microscopic milky way of trich coverage and sprouting more red hairs at odd angles than a ginger on his 14th birthday, the Silver Pearl lives up to its name with its opaque appearance and rarity on mos...”"
MenacingVitamin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1073095,"“Silver Pearl, I believe, is one of the top five strains I've ever smoked.  Intense full-headed buzz coupled with an upper body massaging feeling.  The initial smack in the head settles nicely into a creative or productive, and euphoric long-lasting high.  So nice.

The buds are silvery-white on the inside after you break them open and look gorgeous on the outside.  Just finished my last of this strain and I will mi...”"

Bud was extremely potent, one hit had me going with a pretty good buzz for 30 minutes or so, definitely would reccomend this strain to ANYBODY that can get their hands on this mighty-fine piece of Cannabis. Might be abit hard to get in Australia ...”"

RandyMarsh420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1282744,"“Number 1 strain in my book, never in my life have I seen a poor batch of silver pearl full body relaxation near kinda standards but with an incredible cerebral euforia and near psychedelic mental stimulation. 
Wonderful strain for high tolerances probably not for a first time patent or any unseasoned elderly”"
Toastis1whiteboi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1222757,"“For looks this is a very hairy strain with an standout sativa look. For the high this is not for beginners, it almost had a leather taste with earthy hints. The sativa look may fool you with silver pearl's quick hitting high. The buzz was mostly in my head rather than my body. I felt extremely hazy but at the same time wide awake with almost a boost of energy. This is a great smoke to end a long day with.”"
Schiz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1073097,"“Far and away one of my favorites, I've only had the opportunity to try this once, but I was extremely impressed.  While I don't recall the physical details of the bud (other than "jesus, that's beautiful") it tasted very, very piney and grassy.  The buzz is immediate and ascending, like a wonderful pressure in the head, and stays for hours.  This is the ultimate strain for partying with, or for outdoor excursions.  I...”"
wickedwackguy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1301043,"“A very nice strain that is very easy to grow. Especially good for beginners. Can be easily grown outdoors without any problems. Very unfussy plant. Strong and good smoke suitable for beginner and experienced smokers.”"

It was one of those ones that keeps you moving through the day. Great fruity taste. you will feel the effects right away. If you are a sativa fan this is for you!! 
Great for focusing in on a task and getting it done. Need to do some cleaning... this is for you!!”"
peellesmokes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1225930,"“This strain tastes and smells amazing,
 citrus bliss! Only give it four stars because of the fluffy buds. Great feeling high. Definitely worth trying.”"
Captainstickydro,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1222756,"“From what I've had of the silver pearl I've had joints and bong rips. Bong rips seem to leave your brain in a world famous "sativa swirl" where you're dazed and you can really notice yourself getting stoned and then there's the joint high. This is for on the go energetic all around fun stonyness. Great flavours with a citrusy/berryish pungent yet earthy smell. Overall, great strain.”"

Dafunk420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1334169,"“The most amazing strain ever. This is better than sour diesel and tastier. Even stronger than herijuana or chemdawgs, and super stanky. I can't believe more people don't grow this strain because it's one of the best of all time. Only fruity pebbles og I've thought tasted better but the potency of the silver Pearl nothing comes close to besides crazy sativas.”"

fuzzy23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1527427,"“I give it 5 stars as the buzz and pain relief were perfect for during the day. Mine had fairly high cbd content which may have helped with the pain. This will be one of my favorites from now on.”"
kcvaske,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1527421,"“Amazing Strain. Smell is skunky with a almost tropical smell. 

It hits very well and relaxes your body. I do not have anxiety but I believe someone who struggles with this would benefit greatly. It is a happy, uplifting, calming, strain. I recommended. 

I bought this strain in shake. Still amazing.”"

It is very sticky and smells a bit peppery to me. the high is upbeat and powerful. when I ground it there was a surprising amount of kief in the collector. the comedown is very mellow and left me relaxed but not burnt out. also did not give me munchies. highly recommended.”"
laurenmarie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-pearl/reviews/1293721,"“Love it! Makes me so happy and relaxes me without putting me to sleep. Also love it doesn't give me major munchies (still a little), or couch lock. It doesn't motivate me as much as Green Crack does, but it definitely is a great day high and motivates me! I think this is one of my new favorite strains, also is a pretty good pain killer”"
