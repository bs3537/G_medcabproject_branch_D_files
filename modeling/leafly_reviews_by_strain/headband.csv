Headband
=============
DonutHolschtien,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/headband/reviews/1417793,"“Very versatile strain. It really has  two different highs to it; one is when it's consumed in low doses, and one is when it is in high doses. The most recent batch of this at Montana Buds is around ~22% THC and ~0.1% CBD, and it has an extremely prominent lemon scent, with a hint of diesel. The flavor was surprisingly more lemony, and the thick smoke gives it a creamy aftertaste. Really outstanding flavor. Now when t...”"

In small doses it can leave you feeling uplifted and energetic, but in larger doses couch-lock will take effect. It's usually a very dense and great smelling bud, and if you haven't tried it, you need to get with the program.”"

 It's a creeper type (takes a good min to roll full on you)

I never got that "burned out" feeling ;) (100 A +++)
