fredlib89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-nightmare/reviews/1360829,"“I loved this strain! (I actually suggested it to leafly!) It gave the most stereotypical high I've had. Very giggly, very relaxed, very happy, and lasted forever. The only reason it's not one of my favorites is because, focusing is virtually impossible, and if you want a high for a shorter amount of time, even if you smoke a small amount, its not happening...at all lol.”"
LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-nightmare/reviews/1352480,"“People get ready for this one, it hits HARD and FAST, it's just an insane mix that is a must try! Seemed to help me alot with anxiety, depression, Insomnia, Spams & Pain. I highly recommend trying this one as soon as you can find it, when you do ENJOY!”"

roseysmokes17,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-nightmare/reviews/1352481,"“This stuff smells amazing. It's pretty dank, you can smell it if you're carrying. The high comes on quick and like a previous reviewer said it's very hard to focus on one task. I've done about 20 different things in the past hour. Productive, but a little scattered. It's a very chill, but light high, doesn't bog you down too much. I can walk around and have a good day. It's pretty strong, pace yourself.

Does make me...”"

Kirrion,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-nightmare/reviews/1780348,"“Amazing, very tasty strain. Gorgeous, dense buds with a very strong blueberry smell. 
It also has a very strong blueberry taste, with the Tahoe OG lending it a little bit of spice. 
The flower I had: Relaxing, strong, amazing taste, Perfect for evenings, or any time you need to relax.

This is one of those unique strains that has an amazing smell from a unique sweet blueberry muffin terpene profile, a powerful euphoric effect, beautiful crystal structure and a calm and focused high.

Powerfully effective. I wouldn’t use when I got important things to do. An array of flavors terps but mostly berries and wood. Agro couture has a nice concentrate that didn’t disappoint. Good for night time use or relaxing with a good euphoria that made me laugh.”"

I did feel a little on the edge but this strain relaxed me so much. I also get paranio but the strain oddly gave me no paranioa. The idea is to just enjoy this straind and let it do its just. If you fight it or go against it then you might end up with a bad trip.”"
