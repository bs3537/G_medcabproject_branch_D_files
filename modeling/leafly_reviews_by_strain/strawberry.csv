A very strawberry-berry smell with an undertone of tea makes for a very enjoyable scent. Strawberry has a lot of what I like in a sativa, a great uplifting cerebral buzz coupled with a nice relaxation that keeps anxiety at bay. This is a great strain for depression, anxiety, and stress. The potency is adequate, but not incredible. Overall this is...”"

When it comes to Strawberry you will not be disappointed. A true blue Sativa high that is in company amoungst some of the greats, like Kali Mist, and Strawberry Cough. Leafly is 100% correct about the "uplifting" effect. Go ahead and try to find a strain that has a higher score in "uplifted." on this site. I couldn't but when...”"

This for me, is a great example of a daytime strain. The intense happiness/euphoria is short lived leaving behind less stress, a clear head and happy mood.

thestonerchef,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry/reviews/1382252,"“I love this strain for when I'm dealing with some anxiety in my life. It helps calm the nerves and lifts your mood too. The high is very cerebral with a behind the eyes buzz. which when consumed in high doses does help aid in falling asleep for a good 3 to 4 hour nap.”"
