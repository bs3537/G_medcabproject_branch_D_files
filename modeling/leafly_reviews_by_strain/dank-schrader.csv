cvv1707,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1348244,"“Just loaded some grinded dank into my ascent vaporizer and it almost instantly relieved me of any feeling of anxiety or stress. I then used an adapter to set my vaporizer on top of a glass pipe, put on the tv, and enjoyed the intense feeling of euphoria and relaxation. Great for patients looking for a medical grade indica.”"
SoniChronic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1351752,"“I'm a daily smoker and usually need a strong indica to hit the spot. I'm also a very picky smoker because I really enjoy high grade premium bud. I picked this up at my local dispensary in Vancouver, THC. The bud itself is dense and sticky, full of crystals with a strong sweet Kush scent. It busts up plentiful and is very easy to roll. The smoke is heavy and thick, sweet on the inhale. Immediately I felt my body relax...”"

CheechNBong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1204927,"“I get the dankness, some fire there.  I can feel this already so it came on nice and swiftly. I feel it in both mind and body. Deep, smooth taste with a distinctive flavor.  P.S. Everytime I get high and write a review I seem to always click in the search bar to write my comment.  Can you move search bar to bottom and keep the top for comments with the green add button to the right? Feeling creative, very nice buzz, ...”"
CheechNBong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1315919,"“By far best bud for me up to this point! By far beats 2 ND place by a long shot. Definitely a creeper, takes you to the edge of paranoia bud keeps you on cliff. Like as if you are holding it inside instead of blowing it everywhere.”"
Sapperton_Kush,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1171783,"“This strain is superb. Very potent and medicating. Super effective as something to relax muscles. Bit of a creeper, the most prominent effects were felt after consumption. I recommend this strain to anyone looking for top shelf quality.”"
extremenorthern,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1314492,"“Super duper!! So sticky and buds are big and fat. This is one of my favourites really enjoyed the flavour and nice and smooth. My budtender at MMJ Total health care Kelowna is the best she told me to try this and I was not sorry that's for sure!! Thanks to MMJ I am coming if of my opioids and feeling better everyday!”"

Indicaem,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1274581,"“This strain is the house strain at THC The Healing Centre.  I bought it to assist with sleep but sadly, it did not help with my insomnia. What it did do though, was relax me enough to watch tv and put away my cell phone and computer.   The taste is okay with hints of pine and earth and the high is nice, but overall, I wouldnt buy this strain again.”"
Yule,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1166703,"“Very good strain! I felt Dank Schrader's calming effects instantly after smoking a bowl out of my bubbler. Overall I'd say 10/10! The taste was great, the aroma was GODLY and I felt incredibly chill for about 3 hours.”"
Tmantra,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1764503,"“One of the few indicas that is highly rated for insomnia and fatigue.  One of the best indicas that I've tried for sleep and getting a leg up on the next day.  I use this because a brain injury/post concussion syndrome has left me sleepless for four years.  Starbud is also another really good strain but hard to find.  In the middle of the night when I wake up this helps promote an ethereal sense of well being long af...”"

cato.truth,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1157101,"“One of the tastiest strains I've every smoked/vaporized. I thought my tolerance was high but the Dank Schrader put me back on "training wheels"!

The high left me with a clear head & open mind; I was able to respond well and carry on an intelligent conversation.

I found myself 'living in the moment' and ready to conquer the evening.

Very relaxing; the high lasted almost 3 hours and ended with the best sleep later t...”"
Mosie2017,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1370475,"“I just loved this strain!!  Right from the very first toke it grabbed my head & made me feel euphoric! It burned really good & slow with no blackness at the end of the joint.  It was ridiculously smooth and I really enjoyed the taste! !  Because it was soooooooo strong we didn't have to roll gaggers either so it was extremely economical! ! I couldn't get enough of it! ! 🚬🚬🚬
DEDICATED TO STAY MEDICATED! ! ROCK ON T...”"

I smiled and said thank you”"
lilmike,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1159711,"“cant find any better strain than this, dank schrader gives you that good feeling high, for heavy smokers. would definitely be coming back for more, the dispensary staff is super friendly and welcoming as well.”"

loveandddrevenge,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1532818,"“This strain is definitely a creeper. The smoke is thick and sweet on the inhale, but still mild. I immediately felt relaxed, followed up with some hard munchies. The overall high felt great, but if I smoke this later in the evening it seems to agitate my insomnia.”"

xkScypher,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dank-schrader/reviews/1353737,"“This bud is the best of the best. Top shelf green and that is no joke. Price might seem a little steep at first but well worth it. Smooth taste, burns clean,  and very potent. Highly recommend grabbing some of this if u see it as it is quite rare and gets scooped up quick.”"
