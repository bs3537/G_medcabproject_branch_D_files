saltybirds,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1415753,"“I don't know how to review this mind blowing strain. My wife and I tried a 1g full flower, kief, and distillate preroll. We experienced the full spectrum of what one might expect from this blend of Kush.

Relaxing and euphoric high, pain gone, and the music sounds divine! As I write this, I should be experiencing my nightly myoclonic epileptic jerks (violent body spasms caused by seizures). Not tonight. Tonight I hav...”"
19Socrates16,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1373139,"“This stuff rocks, for me the euphoria was the best part. Like warm waves rushing through every part of my body. It did give me a slight headache one time, but I did vape quite a bit of it. Still great stuff, would buy again!”"
GetmoTrees,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1386927,"“Picked up some shatter! Loved it! Very potent body buzz and awesome heady buzz! Very pretty very tasty! Would absolutely pick this strain up again!!!”"
dldream,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1485891,"“perfect blend of body and head high. pungent smelling and tasting. top 3 of all time for treating ptsd, anxiety and gi issues, next to alien rock candy and magnificent mile/mag landrace/iranian landrace by cresco.”"
AnonymousUser23,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1567330,"“I have MS and am numb from the waist down and am female.  There is nothing available to help female arousal or orgasm.  This works better than when I was 30 and am now 56!! Helps to conquer depression too as I am now no longer taking Cymbalta for that.”"
thatduderyan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1342074,"“Fantastic aroma, very flavorful, and everything you'd want in a heavy Indica. All over body high-- very relaxing and euphoric. Good amounts of kief to save for pressing, too. Definitely a new favorite to my list.”"
RemedyKun,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1412306,"“Beautiful aroma, a deep earthy scent with hints of what almost seem to be mint. A very nice "nothing matters" high that doesn't keep you from almost functioning normally. Will smoke again X3”"
koorocker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1714341,"“Heavy Hitter! One of the more potent strains out of all the dry leaf strains I’ve tried so far from the PA dispensaries. It feels like hands massaging your brain while your body falls into a deep state of relaxation”"
racheljune,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1601009,"“Really beautiful strain. Great for meditations and manifesting positivity. Would be perfect for watching a meteor shower, painting / doing something creative that doesn’t require lots of physical energy. Doesn’t knock you out but is definitely cozy. Decent pain relief without making you feel weighed down. Not a cloudy indica but definitely a borderline psychedelic one. I love this strain.”"
MyDaughterWouldAbsolutelyLoveYou,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1562295,"“An impressive strain and for being a twofold indica I was surprised it gave me a pretty strong headbuzz. Then the it decended to the rest of my body becoming a heavy body high focused on my muscles. I also have to say, being that im sensitive to indicas(make me anxious, dizzy, and my brain just like stops really easily, before I'm even high),  I really appreciate the really strong body effects complemented by relativ...”"
Clvalentino2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1709076,"“Jut tried it for the first time and it is great.  Laying in bed and relaxing instead of my muscle spasms is amazing!  Chill high, not over the top.  Great for pain.”"
shizmagician,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1412305,"“I'm having a great time. Very deep, spacey high, with deep relaxation to add to it. Excellent for meditation in small doses, but a dreamy thoughtful course to sleep in normal to heavy doses. Smells like a "grapey flowers." I'm having a great time.”"
GnarlyBudz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1418159,"“Bomb af. Got a lil dizzy at first but i adjusted. Added to my "Hit" List.”"
VoodooIdol,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1653709,"“This strain similar to Katsu Bubba is a tasty treat from CRESCO and TERRA VIDA.The Live Resins cartridges are so tasty n loaded with terpenes and all that good stuff. I did notice a serious difference in taste adjusting temp on Vape Pen...keep it at 2.0v-2.5 after that it seemed to have a slight burnt taste.
Very comforting,, perfect for socializing, or just relaxing 😌 
A great cartridge to enjoy at th end of a hard...”"

HairKnife,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1536683,"“CAUTION: This strain will become your reference point for best productive indica, thereby applying bias to future reviews.

Alien Bubba is most aptly reviewed in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman:

Mmm...good. 
Feels good.
Is good.
Real good!
Taste good.
Mighty good.
Good for you!
Good for me!”"
PhillyMMJ,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1729161,"“This is my ALL-TIME favorite strain of every one that I've tried so far. it is a VERY strong indica, great for vaping before bed to relax your mind and body and to make you tired. It tastes amazing and is wonderful for anyone with anxiety, depression, and/or insomnia.”"
molex333,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1616500,"“Recently received some of this strain in a cartridge (made by Cresco) and the flavor was great (Cresco carts live resin carts always have great flavor) and it worked very well. I use it for insomnia and it certainly took care of that! Downside, is I did wake up later with a dry mouth. Took a drink and another hit and went back to bed.”"
sweetpineapples420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1546505,"“smooth and aromatic with an instant body to head high.
 
Upon my first inhale of the pre-roll it was instant waves of my muscles and nerves just slowing down, the impulses of pain almost down to nothing then came the  ebb and flow of sedation and relaxation, ultimately leading up to the best 7 hours of sleep I’ve had in over 5 years. 
This is a must have for anyone needing stress Releif, pain and insomnia. Well at le...”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1698320,"“Pretty good strain, not an indica that knocks you out. Still able to function. Improves mood much like a sativa does, but without the euphoria. 
In heavier doses it does make you sleepy.”"

After a hard day at work, I gave Alien Bubba a try, and I instantly felt so relaxed, but not zombie-like. Definitely great to unwind with but still be able to concentrate and keep focus.”"

This instantly toon stress mostly away and relaxed my mind a lot. It also sat my butt down! Seems to also attack my headache as well. Similar to the flower I’m getting waves of euphoria and happiness along with a body relaxation that is almost GG4 Esque how it holds u down 😂 Very interesting peppery and planty taste which wasn’t bad at all and surprisingly even...”"
sarahsnydz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1589698,"“This is one of my new favorites. The body high hits you almost instantly and you get a slight head high too. I love listening to music when I smoke and it was incredible. Very euphoric and calming. Highly highly recommend.”"

Fantastic for neuropathy, pain, anxiety, depression, and to a lesser extent insomnia.  Great bonus is a strong erotic influence :) I have tried over a dozen strains since I got cancer and this is far and away the best for me. Have used this as pre-rolls, buds, wax & cartridge. They are all great, but the wax is j...”"

Sagit,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1609679,"“Excellent for relaxing, not too heavy headed, just right.  It helped my insomnia and chronic pain.  I would buy again.  Danny at the Bell Rd. location was awesome!  Very informative and very kind and gracious and cares about the patients.  He is truly an asset to your dispensary,”"
Monaliza,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1802528,"“Alien Bubba, Indica by Cresco 70% with THC and CBG. This earthy, woodsy, berry-citrus offers a full body relaxation with mental clarity to focus. Great for ‘adult time’ work or other where goals need to be reached that extend past the couch. I use a lower temp for Alien Bubba CO2 cart with Terpinolene, Limonene and Myrcene. The clarity bit comes from a sativaish parent : Alien Kush. This is a sensational medicine!”"

CAK5,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1563098,"“This strain definitely lives up to its effects. Feelings of extreme relaxation mentally and physically. Brings on a happy mellow mood. I do feel a bit dizzy on this even while sitting. So I defiantly would not recommend driving while on this. I still gave it five stars.”"
DukeRaoul,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1578180,"“Super dank. The Bubba lineage was apparent with the first toke. The flavor was what you'd expect from good Bubba mixed with a subtle herbal sweetness. 

The high was a bit of a creeper. Once it kicked in it was super relaxing and laid back with a nice head and body high. Personally wasn't to sleepy or couch locked but definitely some sedation going on. I've also enjoyed mixing this with some Jack Herer during the day...”"
Glittervoice,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1803773,"“I’m impressed. This was a steal ($50 for 1oz) and it is amazing. It gets me focused and relaxed. My body feels heavy and warm, I don’t wanna move at all, but it’s not like I can’t, it’s just that I’m so relaxed that I don’t want to.”"
Doc-Marten,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1681651,"“Smoked some of this strain and I  was surprised at how much i felt the "all up in my head" and thinking too much/internal chatter kinda high it gave me.

NaturesWayMedicine,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1682020,"“Awesome strain that I got here in Pennsylvania from the local Philadelphia dispensaries. A lot of our patients have told us positive things about this strain. It has a dark color to some of the buds with contrasting orange hairs. Sparkles more than the other strains.”"

Heavy hitting and strong smoke.Could really see the katsu bubba influence in the bottom purple-striped calyxes of each bud. Bubba also powers through in the taste. Perfectly dried and cured. 4 huge buds in an eighth”"

CaptainQuazar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1718703,"“A potent strain to be sure. Put me in outer space, or maybe it was inner space. Relaxed, floaty, and thinky. Is that a word? I don't think so, but try some Alien Bubba and you'll know what I mean. It has a nice lavender flavor. Didn't seem to provide as many hits or as much vapor as some other strains, this is what is keeping it from 5 stars.”"
BUD77,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-bubba/reviews/1711451,"“I am not sure all the hype on this strain, but then again we are all different. I suffer Major Depressive order, generalized anxiety & PTSD. my biggest grief with this strain is, it leaves me agitated.
As for flavor, I get a light dry, green/earth flavor. 
just not a winner for me, and with so many strains to choose from, I will continue my journey, leaving this one behind. Happy Highs!”"
