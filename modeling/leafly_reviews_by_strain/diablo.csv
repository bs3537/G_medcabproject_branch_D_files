coreymeans,https://www.leafly.com/indica/diablo/reviews/1417090,"“I like Diablo Og. The Name Steered me away from it but its a very good og strain. Potent with a 70/30 sativa characteristics dominant. I feel it in the back of my eyes and in my head mainly. It helps me to not think so much and not over worry about things. It also kicked up a appetite!”"

This is now my favorite strain I have ever smoked because of the non-existent anxiety euphoric high. I have smoked for 7 years, and this is a different breed of marijuana new to my eyes. Easily my favorite.”"

Beautiful big sticky buds from my dl collective.  They do it all the time.  This stuff could put you under the couch unless u r careful.  All my pain is gone now.  Better than 2 Percocets for relieving my nerve pain and tight muscles.  This big bud is for me (u 2 if you can find it)! Hope so if u need pain relief....”"

Showlet,https://www.leafly.com/indica/diablo/reviews/1229814,"“(Diablo OG) The high ressembles the high of the girl scout cookies. This high gets me so aroused it's really crazy. I would almost smoke this above anything else. The high is a great mix of a body high and a head high, your head feels like its in cotton and you feel like you have fire on your skin, but not hot. Really it's strange and very satisfying.”"
