Sunny D

RebeccaG6,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunny-d/reviews/1792140,"“I bought two 8ths from AltPharm. Grown by Verano. One eighth was great. The second one has moldy tasting buds. I previously purchased a Sunny D cart by Verano. It had the most amazing citrus flavor. I purchased a new one and it was terrible and I cough with each hit. I hope Verano will improve their quality. When they do it well, they do it very well.”"
