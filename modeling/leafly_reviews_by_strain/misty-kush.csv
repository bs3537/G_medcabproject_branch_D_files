The buds are dense sticky and smell very strongly of citrus. I have to keep this in a glass jar because the smell is very pungant. The high the strain provided me was very pleasant, happy, and uppy. This bud gave me a nice boost of energy and permi-grin for the entire time i was high. I smoked a 3g blunt between 3 p...”"

I have to keep it in a concealed jar at all Times otherwise my whole place fills up with the sweet cheesy and citrusy dankness. Very nice high, relaxing yet still functional. The taste is heavenly but the smell is strong af. The serious level of thc makes this one a go to for regular seasoned smokers. 9,5/10”"
lushesgreens,https://www.leafly.com/indica/misty-kush/reviews/1544361,"“Very nice strain, could be one of my favorite indica. DEEP body relaxation, not a lazy one though, doesn't knock you out right away but definitely takes the muscle/joint pain away. Very creative and peaceful, very lovely. Recommend for anyone with pain physically or mentally”"

The odor is pungent, almost like beer hops, and the flavor is grassy and lemony. The high is heady and happy, with a more subtle body buzz following up and bringing relaxation (which is great for stretching or doing yoga...”"

A couple puffs and I felt very much better!!! Bye bye tylenol!!! However, this strain doesn't work for back or female pains. But who cares? Way better than any pill.”"
RAJ-08,https://www.leafly.com/indica/misty-kush/reviews/1383176,"“Misty, is a very sweet tasting, skunky smelling excursion from what I usually smoke ( gods gift, or WSU), and with high THC level of 26% a better bargain overall. The buds are massive and tightly trimmed, awesome find. Thanks to beautiful McKenzie for the advice, good job”"

patriotplayer90,https://www.leafly.com/indica/misty-kush/reviews/1386350,"“Great stuff.  Intoxicating smell, excellent taste, and phenomenal high.  I'm usually not too big on indicas, but this was a very unique strand.  "Happy" is the sensation most seem to associate with this, which I would agree with.  Great mood booster which doesn't bog you down.

It's quite potent, and the high subtly creeps up on you.  By my judgement, it's quite the slow burner; a small amount seems to give off a lot...”"

ryanmats,https://www.leafly.com/indica/misty-kush/reviews/1729217,"“Smoking as a concentrate the taste was more grassy with a little sweetness with a skunk smell. Agreed with other reviews that this produces a lot more smoke as well.  The high THC gives you an immediate high that stays with you and lowers really nice. Even though it is an Indica, this strain doesn’t bog you down at all.  Instead gives you a great happy, uplifted, and relaxed high. Really enjoyed it!”"
