pinkiepie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fpog/reviews/1412746,"“Hands down, my favorite stain.  The only high I bother remembering by name.  Makes me feel super happy, friendly, loving, relaxed, ready to have fun or get some work done.

Also, the potency's what I look for for regular use. You definitely get super high, but not to the point of losing function.  I work from home, and most stuff makes me unproductive.  This stuff makes me appreciate everything more, including my wor...”"

When smelled it smells like super pungent almost a little skunky and very fruity. When breaking up, you will smell the fruity pebbles cereal scent extremely sweet. When smoked it is like taking a big bite of fruity pebbles cereal that leaves you a kush-like high that is extra creative. 5/5 amazing”"
splifroll22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fpog/reviews/1413198,"“For the head,  Fruity Pebbles put me in a straight up whistle-while-you-work mood.  I felt elevated and calm.  This is a more body feeling stoned in the head sorta strain- a little hazey.   I felt warm and happy but not really awake and bright.  I actually felt slowed down creatively but in my mood I felt like nothing could annoy or bother me and everything that usually stressed me out I could laugh at.”"
Garmstrong,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fpog/reviews/1398281,"“Medicinally: For me, this was literally a cure-all. Not an ounce of pain. This was almost like a prescription-pain pill. Helps to literally dissipate any pain that was in your body. If you see it, get it. 

Recreationally: This is quite possibly the best strain I have ever toked upon. I literally felt like I was on an opiate. Blissful. I could have spun in circles and felt as if i was flying. The stars look amazing...”"
noykedem,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fpog/reviews/1392408,"“Amazing strain. My friends and I smoked it last night and I can safely say we all had a rather trippy night. The smell is the first thing you spot, it smells amazing and you truly understand why it is called Fruity Pebbles. Once we started smoking, we all felt the effects almost instantly. For a few of us it took a few minutes to start feeling full effects, but eventually it got there as well. The high lasted us a fe...”"
JuicyJustin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fpog/reviews/1381791,"“This is my first review so bare with me. Fruity Pebbles is an interesting strain. It is a nice balanced cross between an indica and sativa, but from my experience with it I'd say it's a little bit more indica dominant due to the  nice body high it provides! 

Appearance: A nice bright green with bright orange hairs. The main thing I noticed was that there was very little trichomes covering the buds which made me a li...”"

The high lasted for a long time, about two hours, and I felt great afterwards as opposed to how I normally feel tired and groggy.  I had a feeling of "euphoria" after smoking it.  I also did fucking great at COD afterwards, which usually takes an act of God.  So studies may prove that this stuff improves your video game skills.  Great stuf...”"

TheMightyKitty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/fpog/reviews/1353939,"“I had only one hit of this at a party, and I graciously stared into the stars for a good half hour.
