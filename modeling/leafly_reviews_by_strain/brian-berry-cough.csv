Cordicuss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1410378,"“Had some for the first time today.

I've never been one for 'flavors' of weed, because it seems like I always taste something different from my friends who always agree that they taste the same thing. For that reason, I'll leave this part minimal: I will say, though, that I enjoyed the taste. Not tolerated it, but enjoyed it.

For me, it started in the head and it stayed there for a while: 1/4 to 1/3 of the time. The...”"

Absolutely loved the sweet smell of this bud, not as harsh as I expected it to be (:”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1380451,"“Full disclosure... this is a wake and bake review. It's Sunday morning... I've had orange juice, I just made coffee, and I'm watching Friends (apothecary table episode) and smoking a couple bowls of Brian Berry Cough. The flavor reminds me of the cereal Special K Red Berries. First thing I noticed by the third hit was relaxation. My mind blanked out a bit and I felt chill. Started getting that great stoney feeling.

cannaChloe420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1352725,"“great energetic high with this and even some mild pain relief- if your muscles are sore, you'll feel yourself loosen up. I enjoy this at work and it lets me focus on coding, while simultaneously stripping away my anxiety. this is the kind of strain that you can use to focus, but it also makes you want to get up and dance. great hybrid, reminds me of jillybean vibes (hello? space queen is lineage is always bound to be...”"
Pigeyman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1352726,"“Beautiful genetics. The smell is very citrusy similar to grapefruit but also has a mild berry aroma. Beautiful dark green nugs with hints of light green, absolutely covered In crystals and dark orange hairs. Great balanced high, the perfect balance to creative euphoria and couch lock relaxation. Definitely a new favorite of mine”"
happehface,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1381172,"“When I first smoked it I got really high. Huge head high. Intense if you're not a big smoker :P but I've continued to try it and it's a great, chill high. Makes me feel relaxed and positive.”"
NerdyMo420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1352724,"“A hybrid of my two most favorite strains! And of course I love its effects. Nice head buzz-uplifted and euphoric, very helpful with depression. But a relaxing quality with slight energy and boost in focus, helpful with stress and ADD. A near perfect strain in my opinion!”"
gwlilp2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1610309,"“Just finished growing this lil after 10 week flowering period. The description in Leafly is perfect. Most purple I’ve seen in a plant (haven’t grown many purp varieties) deep lavender tipped leaves goes all the way down the coals. Sugar coated and rock hard nugs. 

High starts off in the face and sparks the mind after eventually melting down the body creating a heavier stoned feeling. Good for an evening strain or a ...”"
UncleBud83,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1716498,"“Had to try this one as it shares a name with me. I had really high hopes. I was not disappointed. Not much of a cough fan typically, however this blend is quite good. Pretty little popcorn buds tasting of berries. Very cerebral high for me and a bit euphoric. Would not recommend for anyone with high anxiety. Made me a touch paranoid etc.”"
hybridguy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1294835,"“Absolutely mesmerizing high with this strain. A little heady in the beginning which turns into a sedating body high but then it shoots back up into the head with a creative cerebral high. I felt the effects for almost two hours and I am a seasoned smoker so I would not recommend this strain for first time users. Looking forward to seeing this strain around more often.”"
miketysonlookalike,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1617310,"“Tried this today and was pretty impressed. Nice berry smell, and it tastes like a flower garden. It's very sedating but at the same time energizing. Very nice sativa like buzz, makes me wanna do productive stuff but the indica lingers in the back and I feel lazy too. A lot of euphoria which doesn't come easy for me with flower. 

I think this would be good for somebody who is depressed. Also someone facing a good dea...”"
Heyhoneybee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1463443,"“I just cooked up a mean stirfry and I got super experimental with it.  Mr. Brian Berry Cough is making me ditch the anxiety and lose the inhibition ;)”"

IntoTheMeowtains,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1374086,"“Smoked some of this to help with nausea that I get from vertigo, helped take my mind off it and I was able to keep some fluids down for a while, great taste and enjoyable effects”"

Chimaera,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1615409,"“Picked up an eighth of this yesterday, nice dense frosty buds. Smells a little sweet, vaped about 0.1g in my Flowerpot at 700, taste is sweeter and a bit like raspberry.

Nice eye slouch, slight body tingle, strangely energizing though. Slight dissociation feelings too.”"
Vinny57,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1351145,"“Great taste, and can make you dizzy.”"
levitaylor78,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1551540,"“great for a day of cleaning and activities.  though she is not the strongest of herbs she gives me an energised buzz. the taste is tropical like with a hint of citrus somewhere.”"

ChubbyMermaidMadame,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1681551,"“Today I smoke a blend called Brian Berry Couch and it was great. I have been in high spirits already for the past couple day so this enhanced euphoria significantly. I danced, I sang, and I had a great idea to start a blog and even researched yearly cost 

One year ago, I got on a healthy kick yet again after being told by some irrelevant influences that I was so unhealthy. I purchased a expensive waist trainer in th...”"
Gods_pharmacy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1702139,"“New to site & med cann and this site has been the most help getting started.  BBC surprised me first for the rich berry flavor but the light......but cool buzz but still very functional.  Going through back for a supply.”"
Nick57,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1692854,"“had the pleasure to enjoy this strain today. really good, its more in the head the first half and then a relaxing throughout the body. and the taste well lets say enjoyable not tolerant. 5 out of 5 is where my rating stays”"
SugarMammi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1433834,"“yoooooo, this strain is my newest FAV!! Keeps you up, active, talkative and just going. I deal with crippling (and medically diagnosed) social anxiety, depression on a daily basis. I am very sensitive to strains that trigger these side effects- along side paranoia and headaches- and I noticed that this strain didn't add to these at all. I'm downright surprised and impressed by this strain and suggest patients with a&...”"
Gonzoks,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1397988,"“Great taste and a very mellow high.  While it gets the job done, the high was far less than others we purchased that day.  Mellow flavor, a bit fruity!  The high was very functional and allowed us to enjoy a day of strenuous activities without being funky.  This one came back tested at 14.9% .

We asked the guys at Maggies Farm Pueblo East and they suggested this - a good suggestion on their part!”"
Doc1949,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1425199,"“Just tried it today for the first time. Just what I needed. Strong head vibe and then it moves down in the body. 

I would defiantly recommend this strain.  It is exceptional.........”"

hailSeitan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1333219,"“This strain definitely tastes like berries and settles in behind the eyes first. It tends to stay there, but you do feel a nice bodily relaxation as well. No real propensity to make me cough, although it is working as a bit of an expectorant (I have the beginnings of what I think is the flu right now).”"
MadameGreen3988,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1464811,"“So tasty! Great for daytime use and or being productive.”"
cannaChloe420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brian-berry-cough/reviews/1301207,"“this strain is super uplifting and produces an energetic high (duh, Space Queen lineage). reminds me of good ol jillybean. I am a research assistant and I enjoy this at work- keeps me focused, I'll enjoy before a run, or dancing...it'll also loosen up your muscles.”"
