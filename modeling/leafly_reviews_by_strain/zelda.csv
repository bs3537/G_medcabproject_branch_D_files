The high itself is a wonderful hybrid leaving me functional yet relaxed.
Time has some distortion with this strain. I was playing Ocarina of Time for what felt like 3 hours, but was really 7 hours. I got all the way to the desert level (after starting from the beginning of Hyrule field) without having to remedicate.
Very pleased with this purchase. 5...”"

madrigae,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zelda/reviews/1591724,"“Fragrant and pretty with plenty of Frost and orange threads. This builds nicely with an initial neck-up euphoria that slowly sinks into the body. Extremely relaxing, but not a couch-lock so much as a loose-limbed, warm and pain relieving. I had good functionality and surprisingly no munchies. An impressive strain that will make my regular rotation.”"
Gueritikachica,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zelda/reviews/1755172,"“Mine was called Zelda #9 by the facility. It was a very pleasant smooth smoke. the effects are Relaxing but not too sleepy. a very chill sensation not one of my favorites but still a good one.”"
