Aimsey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-russian/reviews/1243095,"“This has a sweet taste when smoked. The high is not instantaneous, but once it hit me, I was able to totally relax. It did make me sleepy, so this would be a good one to smoke right before bed.”"

It was like riding a train, or perhaps a bus, but it’s a familiar commute. Landmarks sweep past, and you’re into a book or bopping along to a song, Joe’s warm in your hand (go ahead, make it lewd). It’s like this, only softly intense. 

Black Russian, ironically felt by me considering the political climate, feels like home. No witch hunts please.”"

Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-russian/reviews/1271769,"“Very relaxing Indica, with an interesting balance of head and body effects.  I tried it for sleep.  Its not a strain that will lull you into sleep instantly.  Some heady Sativa sensations prevent that, but after an hour and half, I was comfortable enough to get some zzzzz's.”"

Tastesogood,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-russian/reviews/1274188,"“This bud stays true to that berry taste. One hit wonder type. Best if used right before you go to sleep, or I noticed works a lot better then a sativa taking for anxiety later in your day. This is my go to strain for sleep.

tanukimoon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-russian/reviews/1279432,"“While White widow is one of my favorite strains, this mix of Black Domina and her isn't quite on par with what I expected. Very sedating and mellowing, witch was it's only saving grace. Found the lemony flavor pretty nice, but all other flavor was just meh.  I have not tried Black Domina yet, but am interested in trying just her. Nice, but if there are other choices, I'd keep my mind open about it!!”"

pr0digy447,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-russian/reviews/1199319,"“Subtle citrus tones make way to a heavy skunk-scented smoke. Cerebral effects include heavy eyelids and an overall sense of well-being. This strain pairs well with any purple (blueberry my personal choice.) Flowers may not be dense but they are potent enough to feel effects. This strain falls into my "sleep/night" mix.”"
PacificMom,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-russian/reviews/1243996,"“Bravo! The terpenes give this indica dominate a great uplifting, heady effect with the whole body feelin it as well. Great for pain as listed; relief of muscle spasms so welcomed :)”"
