pdoane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-cream/reviews/1409960,"“Ice Cream has white, frosty buds that smoke smoothly, offering hints of pine, vanilla and skunk . The sweet, smooth vanilla flavor that you get from Ice Cream is a fragrant and tasty reminder of the rich dessert it's named after.  The resiny texture will attest to a decent THC level so you can plan on some serious couch lock.”"
b.grizzly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-cream/reviews/1410377,"“By far the best strain out there, puts your mind at complete ease and tastes better than any strain I've had before, found it to also be the most effective for treating depression and anxiety.

Ice Cream makes my head feel like a filled balloon on a string hovering over my body. Using my Arizer, pulled long draws and lasted longer than the other strains I procured at the same time, could have been other variables affecting that, I am not sure.

It’s effects are pretty immediate, you can feel the calm wave of peace roll over you. It’s happy, euphoric, uplifting. I picked up this strain for my cabinet due to reviews for use with PMS. I felt less stabby afterwards, ladies, it’s a good one.

Showlet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-cream/reviews/1333619,"“My best description of the high would be "Soft dreamy high". By this i mean that the head high is very dreamy and the body high is absolute relaxation. You can smoke tons of this, you won't get couch locked or get a "kush" kinda body high. This is not gonna get you destroyed like girl scout cookies or other strong strains.”"
Scribzilla,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-cream/reviews/1343096,"“Probably the most complex strain I've ever smoked.

The aroma, inhale and exhale are all spot on perfection and I wouldn't change a single thing about it.

Extremely potent and works wonders for pain, inflammation and muscle spasms.

One of those new strains that definitely going to become legendary 💯

If you can hunt some down don't even hesitate. 

GET IT 🍦”"

VanIslandCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ice-cream/reviews/1315108,"“Great appearance; buds are dense and the colours remind me of Watermelon. An overall well balanced hybrid that starts out euphoric and ends with a comedown that doesn't cause exhaustion - the dry eyes and mouth are unfortunate side effects though. Powerful  3.5/5”"

This strain is a kief machine! Very dense nugs and looks very similar to the structure and color(s) of Sour Diesel.
