Kazualist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-crunch/reviews/1414443,"“One of the best strain I've tried. Instant effects are mostly sativa (but not overwhelming) with a tingly feeling in the legs then it switches over time with a full relaxing body high while keeping you 100% focused. Great daytime strain!”"

ganjawest,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-crunch/reviews/1790662,"“It’s like a candle that you really love burning in another room. You just get a faint smell of it every now and then. No anxiety and a little body high. Focused. It’s like a little friend whispering hello and giving you a hug every few minutes. Not a prominent high. Lots of talking, I mean look at this long ass review. Social. 

P.S the friend is here...hello”"

baliken,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-crunch/reviews/1414843,"“this is definitely a great daytime strain. very powerful but for the experience users may feel underwhelmed because its effects are cerebal with a good sativa Buzz. The body is there but most of all focus and munchies. Definitely medicinal”"
