thathighfive,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mother-tongue/reviews/1760164,"“Hits you fast, hits you hard. It wakes you up. Borderline euphoric. A good substitute to coffee or energy drinks if you like the jolt of such indulgences. The buds are dense and have a great flavor. Can’t see why it doesn’t have more ratings.”"
TheHighGuyz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mother-tongue/reviews/1364478,"“We loved this strain and had a really good sesh in the woods the buds smelled like Hawaiian punch and were nice and dense. They were covered in tricomes on the outside and had even more when the bud broke open and we got a lot of or if when it was ground.”"
