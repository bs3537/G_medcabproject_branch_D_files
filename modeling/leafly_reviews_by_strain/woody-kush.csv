Woody Kush
=============
RickSimpsonite,https://www.leafly.com/indica/woody-kush/reviews/1373507,"“Got this on special at a local dispensary for $8/gr.

These densely-packed buds are a light green to medium green in color, with light orange hairs.  This stuff smells great.

As for the taste, it is not overpowering, and pretty pleasant.  The smoke itself doesn't seem to expand too much, so feel free to take some fat bong rips.

For the high- I would say it is almost "dreamy".  I was typing on the keyboard while I w...”"

Not a one hitter quitter,but u will be sluggish and sleepy. Very stanky woody accent as it burns, but as u inhale u begin to taste the pine. Funny though, on the exhale, I got a little cheese taste. Recommended for pain relief and insomnia.”"

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/woody-kush/reviews/1385849,"“Woody is a creeper. You immediately feel some mild, sativa-like effects and 5-10 minutes later *BAM* it kicks into high gear, complete with a strong body buzz and reality altering cerebral effects.

The first time I smoked this I took two big hits and thought "no big deal". That is until the effects took hold in their entirety and gave me severe anxiety. Invasive, disturbing thoughts kept coming on strong faster th...”"
2DankFrank,https://www.leafly.com/indica/woody-kush/reviews/1336289,"“Woody is a potent, heavy indica and a creeper that shouldn't be underestimated. Everything's cool for the first few minutes, then you're hit hard and in a foreign place. It's good for pain and sleep (if you don't get too high), but I don't find it particularly euphoric. Makes me quiet and introverted. Strong medicine but not my favorite strain. My first impression was "Jesus Christ, was this shit laced?"”"
LillysBoBo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/woody-kush/reviews/1336288,"“Just tried some right before nite nite time and it's working like dream. Thank god for auto correct. Would give five stars but I never like to put some like that on a pedestal. Real sleepy muscle relaxing buzz ☺️ with a real muscle relaxing vibe yaaa diiiggg it 😋😁”"

matthewhowe,https://www.leafly.com/indica/woody-kush/reviews/1385841,"“Definitely need some experience when tackling this strain. It has potent sedative effects, and gets really stoney. It really takes it time to creep up on you, but when it does it knocks you out.”"

After5hock,https://www.leafly.com/indica/woody-kush/reviews/1204369,"“I bought a half gram of Woody Kush Crumble...First off it has a nice OG smell. Judging by that attribute, I concluded that this was a nug run batch. 

On the inhale, you are treated with a nice Flowery/Nutty flavor. I agree that there is no expansion whatsoever with the smoke, concentrate or bud. 

The exhale is only described as a nutty/cheese type of taste. 


The high starts off as a cerebral buzz and you feel lik...”"

Genetics: Hindu Kush x Master Kush x OG Kush

Both cerebrial and body stone. Heavy in head and face. Lazy and euphoric.

Sweet woody kush scent.

Jules28,https://www.leafly.com/indica/woody-kush/reviews/1650326,"“I am not usually a marijuana connoisseur, so this review is a bit different from others. I suffer from chronic migraines and hate taking the prescription meds I have bc of the side effects. I bought the Woody strain to smoke in a vape, and it TOTALLY gets rid of my migraines with 2 or 3 hits/pulls. It’s a miracle for me. I don’t like the taste of it, but I don’t care. This is a gift from the heavens!!”"
Pickles43,https://www.leafly.com/indica/woody-kush/reviews/1385850,"“I really liked this strain. Had me a preroll from a local clinic. Perfect for relaxing after work. Not to strong and exactally what I was looking for that day just something to take the edge off.  I wasn't to blazed to enjoy my surroundings and company but enouh to forget all about work and daily stress.”"

BearPoZ,https://www.leafly.com/indica/woody-kush/reviews/1163207,"“Tonight was the first time for me using both a Co2 oil in a vape pen and the strain Woody Kush.  The oil has a very earthy flavor (even tasted it when I got a spot on my finger figuring how to load to pen), hence the name, almost like "American Spirit" tobacco, but with a cannabis twang at the end. Nice feeling of "everything settling down",  perfect end to a long day. Still have some energy to do stuff, but I can he...”"

Not a one-hitter quitter but it will put u to sleep after u medicate.”"
