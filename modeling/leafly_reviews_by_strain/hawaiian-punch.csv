nagchampa,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-punch/reviews/1412856,"“I bought this strain for only $7/gm at a local dispensary, thinking that anything at that low price might be great for making edibles.  After vaping a bowl, I changed my mind - I had just bought some excellent herb that I wanted to use for - everything!
Sweet and fruity, easy and smooth going in, this tasty herb gave me a pleasant, uplifted head high and energized me enough that I got through some chores and a lovely...”"

Don't be fooled by its innocent fruity smell and bright, colorful buds; this one is closely related to Memphis Belle, so it'll punch you. And you won't even see it coming.”"
happybud,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-punch/reviews/1369275,"“This strain like many of the other Hawaiian strains can be a little tricky to grow indoors. To see her full potential she needs a much longer flowerings than most of the popular Indica Hybrids around the shops these days. Not known for her indoor production, I've heard that she may do much better outdoors in much warmer climates. 
In 20+ years growing and breeding with this strain I've never seen a single seed in the...”"

The smell and taste of these dense covered tricome nuggets are very sweet and fruity. The high lasted for about 2-3 hours great sativa. Looking forward to try this with the gas mask!!”"
YourMom00,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-punch/reviews/1626681,"“My ex-husband had some and we smoked it last night. 

I found this strain to be VERY useful for me. I had mellowed out. It gave my mind a balance where I can stay focused, where as, in my typical day where I don’t smoke, my brain is almost always jumping from one task to the next. My body was relaxed. And of course it gives that feel good feeling.

I didn’t feel the anxiety, nervousness, paranoid that most people usu...”"

vangink,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-punch/reviews/1090589,"“Interesting that Hawaiian Punch is listed as a hybrid here, because my dispensary had it listed as the only 100% sativa I've ever seen. So, curious as to which is correct. Buds are very similar to the hawaiian haze I had early this year. Pretty loosely strung, light, deep green with long brown hairs. Smell is floral and tropical (not as much so as the Hawaiian Haze). The high is bit more clear headed, given the subtr...”"
benson2676,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-punch/reviews/1503446,"“Had a nice hearty sized bowl of this one for the first time.... wow! Just wow! It's one of those types of high where you are so high that you don't know you're high but then all of a sudden you realize just how high you are. Very enjoyable... fun weird effects like "did I just think that out loud or in my head" followed by "did I just think that out loud too?" !!! Probably the weirdest thing was it was late at night ...”"
