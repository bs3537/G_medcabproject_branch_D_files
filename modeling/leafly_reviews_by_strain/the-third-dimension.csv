Motivating yet I still feel chill.   I wish I had a constant supply it's my go-to med for pain instead if opiates.”"

I’m always a Indica or Indica dominant hybrid lover but this shit makes me feel weird! In a good way. I’m sure you’re reading this saying, “This person was pretty much high when they wrote this.” Yes, That is true, but that’s not point. The point is...You know what? The dispensary ordered ...”"

Very sweet smelling, small popcorn nugs that ground up wonderfully. Just a couple hits is all she took. Grown locally which I totally dig. The only thing I don't like is that I didn't get enough,  it's gone!!”"

The buds were nice and tight , good looking .... 
Each time I smoked it ~ I seemed to get something different out of it . 
One night it put me to sleep 😴 nicely . 
One night it was a decent buzz, but I had to pull out a heavy hitter to get to sleep . 
I medicate all day every day .... So I have to switch things up regularly . 
Overall...”"

Xtlman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-third-dimension/reviews/1443769,"“This hybrid should be approached with caution by users of all levels with the oil concentrate.  Bought .5 ml of concentrate about two months ago.  Tried several methods and found the best was to put a drop on a bowl of flower.  Only problem is, it takes maybe two hits, and then you are elsewhere.  I have lived and gambled in Vegas for 20 years now, and have smoke far longer than that, and have NEVER found myself conf...”"

John_Savage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-third-dimension/reviews/1334528,"“Seriously a winner, this strain. Uplifting and relaxing, it's great for both day or night. It's seriously covered in an almost unbelievable layer of trichomes when grown correctly. The earthy tones shine when done with soil and the pine, citrus, butter and fruit really shine in hydro. Get some if you can, she's really a nice girl.”"

Lately I've been dealing with pain in my back and tremendous pain in my foot (from what I think is Plantar Fasciitis). But can you say "NO PAIN"?! I must add, that I am also a 2 year recovering opiate addict. I pride myself in that. And this strain gives me the hope that there is something other than opiates that can take away ...”"
