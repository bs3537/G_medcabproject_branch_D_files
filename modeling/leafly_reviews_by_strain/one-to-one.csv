My wife could feel her feet for the first time in ten years.
We love this strain.
Got it form Evergreen apothecary in Denver.
Taste was earthy, and woody. Bordering on harsh. Like smoking some  Reggie. Buzz was clear and uplifting, and invoked MAJOR munchies.
My wife had no problem exploring RedRocks after smoking a  joint .
This bud is not for everyone, as its appearance, smell and taste are definite...”"

The flower buds look and smell fairly unremarkable. Small standard looking green buds with no crystals, and just a few orange bits. Hardly any smell. Even when smoking. This may be a benefit to some, but not really an issue if you vape anyway. 

This batch I had was a purely legal medicinal strain. Grown for very hi...”"

It does the job of removing inflammation from my joints and neck without the heavy, drowsy feeling. I like to pair up this strain with Durban Poison before a work out session.
