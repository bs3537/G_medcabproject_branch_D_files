Big White
=============
Maxtopher,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-white/reviews/1280444,"“One of the most mentally relaxing strains I've come across. It obliterates anxiety and leaves you feeling mindful and content. Beautiful looking buds coated in a white frost. Complex sugary taste. Big white is right on point.”"
ghostinthetoast,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-white/reviews/1199837,"“Extremely cerebral and contained.  No elation but instead a sort of warm, confident analytical calmness. 

I think that, like coffee, it was far better when physically mixed with a bit of another varietal, like Purple Berry.  🍇”"

nilberts,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-white/reviews/1280445,"“Big White massages my body and does not go in to my head. A small amount goes a long way. I meditate for 30 minutes after taking one drag and then go in to a deep sleep. Big White has induced strange and vivid visualization during meditation when I have had too much. I will continue working with this strain, specifically with the paranoia that sweeps in at times. This is good for my meditations because I like to work...”"

I have since stayed close to the High CBD and low THC strains in hopes that I can dispell the feelings I don't like such as paranoia and dizzy. upon receiving education I realized that the saying "everything in moderation" hold very true for this. 2 small puffs from a preroll and my pain was taken awa...”"

Prairie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-white/reviews/1224440,"“Harsh.  Somewhat cerebral at first, then sedating after a while.  Pain relief just ok.”"

chinky73,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-white/reviews/1313650,"“leaving another review because Iv noticed that it doesn't  have the same effect as when I first tried it.  It's  not very strong and the high does not last long . I'm actually not sure if I would buy this again , I like high THC and this isn't quite enough me.”"
riftirk,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-white/reviews/1325959,"“Tasted strongly of flower.  Mellow and calm high, helps with anxiety and sleep.”"
BH-Racing247,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-white/reviews/1189643,"“I think this is more towards the Indica strain than the Sativa strain. It calms you down and gives great pain relief. The potency is not as strong as other strains I have tasted and takes a little more to gain the full effects. It does not help the libido, it takes it away. But it is a good strain for pain relief.”"
Aztokes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-white/reviews/1195949,"“Nice light green with little bits of purple its somewhat frosty the taste is nice piney sweet almost like not harsh on the troat”"
OkanaganBob,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-white/reviews/1500180,"“Excellent Indica. Relaxing, yet uplifting. Tastes sweet and a bit fruity. Smooth smoke.”"
