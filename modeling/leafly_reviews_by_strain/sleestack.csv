seanzy84,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1410419,"“nice tasting and smoking sativa hybrid. tastes a bit sweet, chem/diesel, and a slight undertone of pine and skunk. as for working for medication for anxiety, depression, or sense of general well-being. slightly relieved some nerve pain, and dulled a bit of back pain also. definitely would recommend for sativa likers or for a good midday smoke. got from naturalrxnm in Albuquerque NM as a preroll for a Pennie with any ...”"

Actually a pretty spacey high at times
+still able to function 100% 
+actually helps to null out boredom from tedious tasks.. +enjoyment of any activity Ive done has increased!.. 

Arrives right behind my eyes, into my ears and to the back o...”"
Mrmellowman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1496464,"“Was a little bit of a creeper for me. Had the giggles after about 10 or 15 minutes. Heady high with a body relaxation to it, can be pretty strong if you smoke too much. Overall good stuff.”"
hunter9231,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1361057,"“LOVE this new fave! It's so unique -- it's almost a spiritual experience! Have the oil.. quite interested to know if flower is similar. DEF not for novices, but 'the pros' will most certainly enjoy this strain. Taste is so pleasing, but hard to describe. Easy on throat + lungs, a true sativa and real winner. Try if you get the opportunity-- you won't regret, promise! 🙃”"
Trisha44,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1517516,"“Get this if you see it. I am generally a fan of sweet smelling strains but this is an exception. Difficult to articulate the aroma and taste but it's delicious and addictive! 'Fruity Gas' is one way to describe it. The buzz is positive and medium/strong. It helps me with physical relaxation while I make lists of all I need to get done.”"
shatterchamp,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1276166,"“This has become a new favorite for me, had never herd of this or seen it before I got it. looking forward to getting some concentrate. After blazing a fat joint I was super baked, like slow motion and blissfull calm. Very pleasant. A great Sativa through and through.”"
CchunTim,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1207206,"“Love it, distinctive taste (in a good way)
taste is from the lambsbreath, and haze.
Grew well, produced some sweet colas,
and great sativa high, 1 of my favorites.”"
mudflapp,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1285574,"“Good septivia. Made me want to turn into big eyed green alien worker drone and change my name to Tor. Really though, I was out of Durban and this slid in the spot nicely. Good day blend for getting it done. Especially if you are reptile like alien.”"
mstuffsy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1184980,"“Sativa dominant. Smells amazing (like Christmas). Besides smelling and tasting great, it's pretty average compared other sativas I've tried. Nice head high, not much couch lock. After smoking it I really just want to get up and do something. Makes you a little anxious and paranoid at times, but nothing you can't shake off.”"
gngr,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1291023,"“i just got 1/2 oz of some organically grown sleestack from northern california. i've been smoking on it all day and i've been lovin it. one negative would be  that it did seem to bring forward some anxiety but it wasn't anything a little focused breathing couldn't help. overall very solid strain. beautiful nugs with an increeeedddiiibllleee aroma.”"
TheKidMP,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1319993,"“A nice uplifting cultivar that is awakening without a lot of "raciness".  I experienced the wonderful Sleestack in the form of hash rosin, in shatter and budder consistencies.  The aroma had a floral-pine smell that left a cooling sensation throughout the sinuses.  It tasted of real soft non-artificial lemon-lime with a hint of the floral-pine that was on the nose.  The texture of the smoke was fluffy, and expansive ...”"

nathanrand1295,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1191238,"“Sleestack is an amazing sativa dominant strain. It makes me feel super happy and talkative and ready to go. Gives the perfect bony high, not couch locked at all. Very happy! Great strain!”"

Duda1910,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sleestack/reviews/1266823,"“Growed under pro grow 400. Unfortunately didn't get fat buds but the one that I got iwere very resinous. Clean Sativa high, well being and uplifted, nice to have a beer and something to eat after.”"
