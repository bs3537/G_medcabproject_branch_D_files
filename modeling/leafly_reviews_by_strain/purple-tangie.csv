betterthanbooze,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-tangie/reviews/1256226,"“Very unique tangy flavor and appearance. The taste is almost perfumed, buds are not too dense and gorgeous purple mixed with orange and green hairs. Glistening trichomes. Positively sativa style buzz.  Medium strength, very creative and up. I haven't seen or tasted anything quite like it in a while- after a few days of medicating with purple tangie I had to go back to get another 8th. I'm now saving it for special oc...”"

MMJPatient223,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-tangie/reviews/1606322,"“It's good nice warm buzz like high,focused ... When you want to smoke purps but don't want that heavy indica high ..smoke some Purple Tangie it's sativa side counters the sleepy effects to a level where you feel relaxed and chill but not couch locked.”"

LavenderDreamz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-tangie/reviews/1303826,"“I don't have anything negative to say about this strain. The taste and smell are a combo of sweet citrus and funky skunk (which happens to be my ideal terp profile) and the cerebral buzz keeps me going for hours! 
The buds are a beautiful green with purple tips and orange hairs! Looking good enough to eat, but I think I'll just smoke it all instead 😍”"

EpiphanyPause,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-tangie/reviews/1593379,"“The buds are nice and chunky. I noticed a lot orange hairs. When you smell the bud it almost smells like a orchid. When you break the bud down, it has a great pine scent which gives the user a preview of what is to come. Very deceiving. I took 3 tokes and began to feel the effects.  Relieved a headache I had, increased my appetite and gave me the motivation to write this review.”"
sparty121,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-tangie/reviews/1484258,"“Purple Tangie gives me a quick head high that starts out as a buzz and melts into a warm hugging feeling across my forehead. Too much gives me a headache, though. Otherwise, I feel happy and relaxed.”"
ProfessorV,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-tangie/reviews/1718782,"“Purple Tangie is an exemplary Sativa in both its form and function. This spicy, minty, and potently citrusy flower is epic. The large, golden trichome COVERED buds are accented by deep dark purple sugar leaves. It's Tangie - Skunk heritage is evident once any stash of this is opened, overtaking the space with notes of orange liqueur and dankness. The high is stratospheric yet very clear, making you extremely talkativ...”"

Shnoke,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-tangie/reviews/1804472,"“It may be said that my experience with this particular strain was only with a single pre roll. 
This strain has a flavor profile very close to it’s very name. A gentle stream of citrus stimulates the palate. The aroma is warm and enveloping. Given some time, a sticky residue will begin to coat your lips with orange like flavors. However, the high itself is rather insignificant. There is little to describe beyond that...”"

I was expecting an uplifting and racy Sativa high, but for me it was more like a heavy hitting Indica....It looks so pretty with the purple colors and sparkly buds and a pleasant earthy orange citrus spice kinda flavor...I experienced an intense high and blurred vision, euphoria was soon given way to sleepiness. I took a nap and woke up with a neck headache. Not sure if this will be...”"

The buds smell have an overpowering tangerine aroma with subtle hints of grape. The smoke is sweet and citrusy, with plenty of tangerine flavor that gives way to red fruit on the exhale. This strain gave a balanced high reflective of...”"

However, as someone who struggles with anxiety and an abundance of energy this was a concentrator I had to be very careful with… And the cartridge at 1 g from LA Kush ended up lasting over a month because of how slowly I used it. One or two heads would absolutely fill a person with an insane amount of energy,...”"
