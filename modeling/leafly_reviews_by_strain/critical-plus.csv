From start to finish it grew quick and strong, producing dense, hairy and resinous nuggets. The smell and taste is reminiscent of a sweet hash with hints of musky orange peel.

Dry crumbly buds that smoked evenly. Pretty smooth smoking in a small glass pipe. I prefer lower doses and use for recreation, maybe .1 grams flowers per dose.

9/10 for this one. Mellow, invigorated vibe perfect for music or a project where you can get locked in and creative.

This strain is perfect if you're looking for a very basic stoned feeling, though falling short of the super-blazed stoner movie stereotype type of stoned.  It's almost there, but missing some of the giddiness and spontaneous bursts of laughter.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, since it's way easier to keep a straight face or play serious if the need arises.  The head feels like it's stuffe...”"

ragginar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-plus/reviews/1300074,"“This strain is amazing.  I had to do harb labour today for 12 hours and I smoked 3 blunts during the day.  It was a very nice high and didn't slow me down at all.  Then tonight when I wind down, the stoney effects of the plant take over and provide a very pleasant relaxing high.  This is grade A medicine.”"

Went back home and ate a sandwich made by Natasha, was wonderful.”"

Much rather have someone kick me in the face. Closest thing I've smoked to Mexican dirt weed in a long time. Feel like my dispensary tricked me and I'll try to convince them to pull it. Trying to take symptoms away not add them.”"
