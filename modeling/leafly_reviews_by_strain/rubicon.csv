kyleGHAD,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1350892,"“This strain keeps a clear headed, awakened high, no grogginess or "stoned stupid." Definitely and indica with its gentle body relaxation, a euphoric blanket of comfort tingles throughout my entire body. My mind is at ease, peaceful; as an anxious person this is heaven. I would recommend picking this up as a medicinal for the CBD content (~9%) or as recreational for a happy, relaxed day with a light high.”"

My Kids 72% I actually wanted to play with them.
Wife -34% notice the nagging!!!

Overall best product so far and...

HMdoc420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1475961,"“This strain is very good for when my back starts acting up and my arms and hands start to tingle and go numb. It is not too potent so it can be used at any time for myself. But it does help and keeps me pretty clear headed, but gives a nice little stone. I wish there were more potent 1 to 1 CBD and THC strains but this one is great. I tell everyone who truly smokes for medical reasons to try this strain. Mixing it in...”"
LotusKai,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1543548,"“It's quite the exceptional CBD strain with a 1:1 THC to CBD (both were 10% on my batch.) It has a very relaxing pleasant body high to it, nothing too heavy yet still very noticable. There is a slight head high, a pressure around the forehead and a slight sensation in the eyes. I can't speak on how well it works for pain because I actually use CBD strains for the great anti-anxiety/euphoric properties which arent as n...”"
terplinolene420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1350894,"“By far one of the best CBD-rich strains I've tried so far. Produced a modest buzzed feeling coupled with that irresistible pain relief that all medical patients seek. As far as taste goes, I would describe a sweet sage with hints of citrus undertones.”"
woundedwolf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1350893,"“Rubicon is truly an answer for the question "What can make my pain subside or go away" and it makes your day!! Not much on taste but very good for pain!!!! Good to use first thing in the morning!!!”"
DGregory82,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1322721,"“One of my favorite strains to smoke after a long day at work. Relieves my body aches quickly. I like to sprinkle a little kief or hash on top of a bowl for a good mental buzz.”"
mindfulmari,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1366780,"“Relaxing and mellow. My pain level and inflammation dropped a little. Did not make me feel anxious. Made me want to watch 90s movies and eat carmel corn. Easy to go to sleep but doesn't make you feel like you have to.”"

snowman74,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1356994,"“I'm sick and deal with alot of pain but the cbds in this strain really help me to escape alot of that pain. I recommend this one for anyone who needs some pain relief. #420sweepstakes”"
NoseOfAMouse,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1668184,"“This my favorite strain of Cannabis to date. I’m partial to Indicas anyway, since I love mentally-mellow highs and relaxation of the body. The presence of the cannibidiol makes this variety SUPER mellow, with no paranoia and no edge. As a bonus, I always feel a bit giddier and happier after vaporizing some of this dry herb, and as someone who’s torn knee ligaments, I would use this regularly for pain mitigation and a...”"
gemyni,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1424538,"“smoked my first joint of Rubicon just now. Got it from The Green Solution in Denver. I'm not that impressed. Its supposed to be an indica but I'm not feeling much of a body high. Not much of a high at all actually. Usually I only need 2-3 puffs to get super high and I smoked this whole joint and feel moderately high. I like that its a CBD dominant strain because that helps me anxiety and panic disorder. This is defin...”"
RubyRabbit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1520489,"“Rubicon is truly amazing. I have scoliosis and chronic back and neck pain that make daily activities really painful. This strain has changed my life. It feels like someone is giving you a back massage. No spacey head high, just relaxation and tingling in the muscles, followed by total pain relief. Lasts all through the night and well into the next day. Cannot say enough good things about it. It's a good, good friend.”"
moochiez,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rubicon/reviews/1350368,"“Very chill, extremely mild. Takes a lot to actually feel "stoned" which is not a bad thing. Makes it easy to go to sleep, but doesn't knock me out immediately. Easy to stay focused and productive without losing my self in a project.”"

Well, this one definitely had me sitting there in my back yard looking at my beat up old metal tool shed for a good damn minute experiencing all highs from these maryjane-happy flicks. Definitely worth the smoke and even better if ...”"
