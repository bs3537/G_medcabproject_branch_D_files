Cinex

Beardly,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1417116,"‚ÄúA morning bowl of this and I'm ready to get the kids off to school, wife off to work, and get my morning workout in and I keep going strong all day. Eases the pain of my back and helps me think straight.‚Äù"
kjdawg,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1417541,"‚ÄúSo, I honestly don't really like weed. The smell grosses me out, and almost every strain I've tried makes me nauseous, anxious, and paranoid, and then completely knocks me out. Indicas are the worst, I seriously can't handle those at all. Sativas are better, but they still don't feel good. With a weird spinal deformity (I have an extra vertebrae that's broken and grinds) that causes unbearable pain in my lower back a...‚Äù"
DJChronic,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1417542,"‚ÄúAs I suffer from PTSD, anxiety and chronic pain, I have been looking for a strain that is also good for my girlfriend's depression and ADHD. Cinex turns out to be excellent for us both. Happy, mellow head high, with excellent focus that leads to an overall feeling of well being and relaxed happiness. Good choice for pain, works great for anxiety, and quite fun. It also has the added benefit of arousal! A great all ar...‚Äù"
PotConnoiseur,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1417543,"‚ÄúLOVE this Cinex Sativa strain! Not only did it help reduce all my inflammation, my girlfriend enjoys my company, AND I feel great the next day. Not to mention, sex is ah-may-ZING! (I smoke flower at night to reduce inflammation and help me fall asleep. I also live with HIV and overall feel more mobile)‚Äù"
Judio,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1417695,"‚ÄúI never write reviews on Leafly anymore, but f*** it, Cinex deserves it. Badass strain, my favorite of 2016 hands down. Only smoked flower of this strain once but it was bomb. The concentrate form of this strain, however, is actually what I want to talk about today. 

For about a month, Cinex wax was all I smoked. The wax had a really gooey consistency, had a thc content of 82% as I recall, and I could always get it ...‚Äù"
Snakeeye,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1417545,"‚ÄúCinex is my favorite high to date! With Cinex, you get that nice mood boost without paranoia/anxiety of some of the more popular Sativas. I felt like my problems and worries were washed away, and I was actually much more motivated and productive.

The effects are pure sativa, but I imagine the indica in Vortex blunts some of the raciness of pure sativas.  Cinex is excellent for interacting with the world.

Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1372276,"‚ÄúCin X is a great hybrid.  Seems Sativa dominant to me.  Makes me happy and focused while still giving some body high effects.  A little anxiety/paranoia creeped in, but not much, and not for long.  A solid 8 for me.‚Äù"
LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1413303,"‚ÄúGot some in concentrate and I really have to admit when me and my friend dabbed this amaizngness, we went straight stupid!

GettinHighSince95,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1389074,"‚ÄúThis is the best cannabis strain for me. Excellent uplifting yet relaxing sativa hybrid. Never lets me down. The smell and flavor is very consistent from grower to grower and is very unique and recognizable.  It has a pungent piney mossey smell with a hint of citrus. Pure pine on the exhale, taste delicious. A couple puffs here and there and it keeps me going hard all day. If your a labor worker you need to try this ...‚Äù"
MzNu2Weed67OR,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1386902,"‚ÄúI really love the Cinex! It's my favorite so far. It is a great day-time high. It helps with the pain, although not as deeply as an Indica does for me (like Orion's Belt, which I like to take a puff of before bedtime).. it's more of a "forget" you're having pain feeling. I get very energetic and clean the house, work on projects that I've been putting off. I get very aware of my surroundings, like noticing things tha...‚Äù"
ctoma7,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1417700,"‚ÄúI only ever smoke at night, after the sun has gone down. It helps me sleep, calms my mind a bit, gives me a little euphoria and I enjoyed that way.

I used to enjoy smoking during daylight hours, too, but as of late I have not been.

Just too much sluggishness to be productive.

That all changed recently when I was introduced to some truly beautiful Cinex flowers.

Cenex is a solid strain if you're looking to get things done.  Whether you're on your feet or behind a desk this strain will keep you going like the energizer bunny.  Providing a giant cerebral boost you'll most likely find day to day tasks much more enjoyable and tolerable.  As far as aroma and taste go,  this specific version has a strong citrus flavor.  Very plea...‚Äù"
Barronvongrateful420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1367063,"‚ÄúWonderful. Great earthy ( Organic ) taste with a heavy stone that's immediate. This strain reminds me of the first  times I really enjoyed the high. I have been smoking for 44 years and it takes me back to those days when it seemed easy to achieve a long lasting high that almost cripples you. I highly suggest this for pain relief. I don't normally write about the pain qualities in a strain either because we all know ...‚Äù"

Smell: VERY earthy, almost spicy

Taste: definitely spicy, with a pungent background to it

Probability of munchies: medium

Effects: very euphoric and uplifting mentally, and very light and tingly on the body. This strain is a hit or miss with anxiety, I find it borders on the "too up-itty" feeling that can set off panic attacks in some, so tread carefully if your treating anxiety. In smaller doses though, th...‚Äù"

Well, Cinex is THE strain that helps my adhd. Two or three hits and I feel uplifted, focused, and mildly energized. Not the strain to "get high" with or bring to a party, but has great medicinal potential. For that alone I have to give top marks.‚Äù"

Mikeman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1326968,"‚Äú@mike_the_budtender with another strain review! Cinex or "cenex" in this case. Grow Op Farms is the producer. It's another top shelf strain by them. Very uplifting high, great daytime weed, good for focusing on a project or enjoying the outdoors. This cenex is great for everyone it doesn't have a staggering thc so it comes on gentle. üëçüëç‚Äù"
