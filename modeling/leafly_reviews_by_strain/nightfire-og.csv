houghtyhawk,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nightfire-og/reviews/1359052,"“This particular strain lives up to its description and was recommended by the staff at Ganja Goddess for some additional "nighttime"  fun.   The description misses the additional arousing effect that is an added benefit.   Like Lavender strain the tingling sensations are present in those nether regions.   The benefits in combination with the euphoria create quite an adventure in bed.  Multiple and prolonged orgasms w...”"

NWeedoisseur,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nightfire-og/reviews/1359053,"“Just bought a 1/4 of this by Traiblazin.  Easily my fav sativa yet (beats Black Cherry Soda and Middlefork by Royal Tree, and Dutch Treat by Phat Panda)  After one hit i felt like I was smoking for the first time again.  As powerful a head high as some good concentrates.  A worthy buy while it's around.  Very curious to try other Traiblazin strains!

FYI - my 1/4 was 35% total cannaboids and 30% THC with 3.34% Terpen...”"

The buds are bright green absolutely covered in white trichomes not super dense more fluffy but still beautiful looking the high is super euphoric it's actually sold as an Indica because the slow down feeling this strain offers is usually associated with Indica but bud structure alone looks sativa dominant. Awesome unwinding strain tons of relaxation and euphoria without ...”"

I purchased this at a top shelf price and expected a lot out of it. At low doses it definitely helps with pain and can be a bit much in the category of cognitive function. I just smoked a really large joint of it mixed with something with common lineage to blue dream and dear god.. At large doses it is ...”"

This is a great strain for social settings or for a long list of to-do's!  Tasty sativa that smells like citrus girl scout cookies.  A perfect morning strain, even better when I mix a high CBD strain such as AC/DC to take the edge off.”"

Hexnut,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nightfire-og/reviews/1740308,"“The stuff was on sale, and the buds...tho small in size...looked furry and tri-chromy, so I purchased a 1/2 oz. Opened the pre packed bag (it was on sale) and got a skunky scent. Good so far. Loaded the bong and waited for what I consider to be the best indicator of strength...the expansion. It has expansion. Excellent. 3 hits later I feel fine...euphoria, strong head AND body buzz. I do not understand the low rating...”"

When I did I was surprised how weak it looked. Barely any visible trich, dull greenish beige loose nugs with dark orange scraggly hairs. A bit leafy and the dark green leaves are scraggly as well. Smells very spicy with a hint of lemon and wood. Taste is bland, mostly woody with a hint of pepper. Effects are slightly r...”"

I hate to spend that much on reefer, but , i hate to say it, its the best bud ive smoked in some time. Heavy head hitter after 1 hit out of a small bowl. Great taste great smell, i grew up on 35$ oz's, so paying 50 for 3.5 grams is hard, but hey, it aint 1980 anymore. ✔ it out”"
