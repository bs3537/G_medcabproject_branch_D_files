Pretty short bushy plant with fat leaves during growth, doesn't start producing heaps of visible resin until later weeks of flowering so doesn't start to stink for a while. A plus for those concerned with odou...”"

I agree with the Paradise Seeds description - "swift lift off with an increased sensory awareness, particularly in the audio and visual departments".  Instant blanket of pain relief.  Uplifted, creative, and focused enough to pull off some gnarly malware reverse engineering on the Dutch Kush yet its also perfect for swimming pool/movie/music relax.”"

Within 30 mins I was on the couch knocked the fuck out 5:30pm approx. with drool all over my face and chest, woke up the next day at 8am slightly hungover and drowsy. Not a strain for active people, but if you can't sleep, or eat, this will be your best friend.”"
ArashiTora,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dutch-kush/reviews/1320757,"“Not as sedative as I thought it would be, the effects came slowly. At first you're giggly, then hungry and sleepy. It's great to eat something really sweet after this strain.”"

Su sabor no es tan agradable, pero llega a. conseguir los  efectos esperados.”"
OG_Gaddie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dutch-kush/reviews/1374091,"“Real nice strain, intense high, very potent. Beautiful buds, heavy crystals, dense, grows very well when topped. Medium to high nutrients, with average yield.”"
pegcitybudz6,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dutch-kush/reviews/1670055,"“One of the best strains out there. Fully sedative is exactly right. I’m a heavy smoker and it knocks me on my ass. Perfect for after work relaxation or before bed. If you’re new to the game I’d take this stuff slow. Packs a punch!”"
