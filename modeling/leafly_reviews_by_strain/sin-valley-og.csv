wonka44,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1301769,"“One of my favorite ogs was super happy to hear they had this and a few other strains at dispensaries in Vegas. The smell is super potent and rock hard frosty body. Great for relaxing after a long day or for sleep. Truly sticky icky in all good ways.  Taste amazing in joints. Lasts all the way thru. Sinfully amazing”"
Hendertucky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1366931,"“This is a fascinating strain. You can achieve so many different goals like trying to sleep, creativity, euphoria and pain relief all by how much of the flower you smoke. I know that sounds a little silly because that can occur with any strain. The best analogy I can give is think of strains as colors. You smoke a green strain. The more you smoke the greener you feel. With Sin Valley OG it does not matter what color y...”"

I need pain relief! That's where this outstanding strain comes in. It starts with a relaxing cerebral high which allows me to be less focused on the nagging pain in every joint. Need I say more?”"

Kiekie18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1366929,"“If what you seek is relaxing, creative, or body soothing; this is for you. 
Whether it be musical, artistic, linguistic, or visually; this strain will boost it. I love it for when I need motivation to paint.”"
armstrong423,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1371460,"“This was a time-slower for us which made a fun 1 hour high feel like 4 hours. It starts fun and social and giggly then slowly transitions after an hour or so to a heady thinker. Next comes the heavy body followed by an immediate need to sleep. The Sleep is deep and hella restful. Memory is spotty next day. For when you wanna have a good time but need to go to sleep in a few hours.”"
vegasgurl357,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1257495,"“Nice buzz onset... not a long lasting buzz..
gives you a nice heady feel good buzz...smoke too much of it the indica kicks in and couch lock..I would try again
It made mouth dry tho...”"
ye11eker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1672388,"“This is an utterly common strain, looks good, smells okay, would not get a fly high. The stuff we got came from Mohave Cannabis and it was very disappointing since it was supposed to replace another strain that they grew that was absolutely great. We are what they call seasoned consumers and from our point of view this is just fluff weed, good only as a sort of marijuana helper.”"
stendek,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1271871,"“Very tasty, very pleasant head and body high. Sparks the creativity quite admirably. One of the best indica-doms I've ever smoked.”"
rbrthrrck1117,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1281198,"“this strain was very well balanced and strong. easily a new favorite. I've tried 3 different strains so far from body and mind and they were cured perfectly.”"
BSM,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1366927,"“It Nice and light at first with a touch of sweetness and touch of bitter. It's a welll round pinch of lemony fresh on the finish. The feelings sneak in slowly. It allows for a light and joyful effect surge of relaxation and allows those stresses to just melt away.”"
carterkush092,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1700248,"“Great bud structure this strain has. A zesty lemon taste that is well enjoyed by me. I smoke a joint of this everyday before work n it keeps me zoned but still sharp enough to get my ish done.”"
AndreaN,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1265375,"“Another Strain I'm trying out by BaM - Body& Mind.  Lovin their strains- just wish they would start packaging their product in glass jars !!! 😁
I will start out by saying this is 26.13 THC.

A very nice hybrid - a little bit sticky , nice aroma . Good for day or night time use .”"
WashingtonGreenery23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1271120,"“Very pleasant high. Head heavy at the start and slowly moving to a body high. Euphoric as any strain I've had. Tested at 22.46%. Highly recommended for anyone who' wants a balanced hybrid.”"
despejada,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1278317,"“Another great hybrid balance!  Kicks in fast - I get that sensation in my eyes telling me "it's working" while I'm only halfway into what I think I should consume. :-) This is a really contemplative, insightful high for the first while - the kind where you just sit there and think.  Fantastic for listening to music or watching something intense, as well.  As the head high fades I find I'm knocked out on the comedown....”"

cannachris46,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1366935,"“Girlfriend and I both enjoyed the relaxing sensation we got and I noticed the pain in my joints, especially my shoulders became relieved tremendously. Only drawback was I totally coughed my brains out, could not get a smooth drag from this pre roll for the life of me. But the body effects are superior to many strains I've tried.”"
SpeshulEd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1366937,"“Being an indica hybrid, I chose this as an evening strain. It was recommended to me by the budtender as one of the better strains so I went with it. It's a stronger strain and I definitely suffered some couch lock, but that's fine, that's kind of what I got it for. Others say this strain makes them feel "relaxed" and "euphoric" and I think that sums it up pretty well. Was nice to relax with while watching some tv and...”"
CTglobsquad,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1366936,"“This strain provides a relaxing high and I would recommend it for pain and also a sleep aid. I would recommend use for late afternoon or night time.”"
GettinHighSince95,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1366942,"“A relaxing and euphoric high. Works very well for pain and tired muscles. Smells and taste sour and earthy. Very pungent! A pine and fuel taste on the exhale.”"
weedsley,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sin-valley-og/reviews/1366928,"“Very strong hit, makes you cough hard, and if it's a realistic bomb strain, Harvey head buzz like GDP but this also gives u a headache and paranoid.”"
