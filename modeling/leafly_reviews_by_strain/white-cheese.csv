LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cheese/reviews/1383351,"“I recently came across this strain and all I have to say is DAMN this stuffs DANK! It's a very potent cross of UK Cheese and White Widow, I use mine for nighttime use as it will put me to sleep it is a very pungent strong strain that has climed up the top of my ladder quickly. Smells like dank cheese smokes like heaven, great for almost everything honestly. If you see this strain in your local dispensery DEFINITELY g...”"
BJW,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cheese/reviews/1351893,"“A cross of two really nice strains, White Widow and Cheese, via Zambeza seeds.  The skunky-cheesy funk is very much present and there in equal parts is the Widow's hashy-earthy scent ... you can tell this is going to be potent at first smell.

Looks more like the Widow as well, with a medium-darker green appearance and reasonably dense cone shaped nuggets - a little bit of the gold look from the Cheese and the pale w...”"
Edenic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cheese/reviews/1388817,"“Flavour reminds me of artificial white cheese covered popcorn. Very pungent, funky and earthy. Effects: body high/warmth, controlled appetite, moderate energy, very subtle dry mouth.”"

MarcusXL,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cheese/reviews/1320588,"“I always look for a Cheese when I want a robust Indica vibe but without the generic Kush couch-lock. White Cheese is one such, and it provides relaxation but with the classic White Widow creative-happiness. I bought this most recently at Eden, who had it as a 60/40 Sativa hybrid. I would differ and go with 60/40 Indica, due to the subdued stimulating effects. 
Experienced smokers should look for a stronger Indica lik...”"

AL.SA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-cheese/reviews/1590745,"“When I first tried a cheese strain it was U.K cheese. White Cheese is a good cross. Not as good as U.K cheese but definitely up there. Smoke is a little harsher than others but its got a great taste. Lemony/chocolatey. Great aftertaste. It smokes very slow in comparison to other strains. Rolls very smoothly. Very nice headbuzz, body buzz to the shoulders. Long lasting high and smells amazing. Guys, any cheese strain ...”"

It has a pungent cheese flavour and aroma. This strain is a hybrid so it does not deliver an overwhelming indica lockdown like the other cheese strains do.”"
