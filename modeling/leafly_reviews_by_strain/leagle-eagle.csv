This strain has a sativa kick that makes the world brighter.  We had some work to do and this strain really focused us as we pulled weeds for an hour with euphoric vigor that lasted a while.

KHenn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/leagle-eagle/reviews/1360025,"“This is my favorite strain right now. Great daytime smoke where I can remain functional if I want to, or get lost staring at a painting for ten minutes if I feel like that. 100% recommend this strain 5/5!!”"

criptan420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/leagle-eagle/reviews/1251980,"“This is the perfect strain for someone like me who suffers from the fatigue and pain of hashimoto's and fibromyalgia. Most days it is hard for me to be motivated and in the mood to do anything. This strain not only eliminates almost all the pain, it also leaves me extremely motivated and energetic.  I am starting to feel like myself again before I was diagnosed with my conditions. Keep up the great work L'eagle!”"

Vikish,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/leagle-eagle/reviews/1390455,"“This strain is amazing every time I've gotten it! The taste is incredable, very sweet like candy or flavored cough syrup, and always goes down smooth. Uplifting and somewhat energetic this sativa dominent hybrid is a fantastic daytime high. The creativity boost keeps me going for hours. 5/5 Amazing!”"

The all organic side of things is really important to me so they will continue to have my business. The last time we went on Black Friday and got an OZ of Strawberry Cough for $99 dollars!!”"
WCisco,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/leagle-eagle/reviews/1790422,"“This is a great daytime sativa for those who enjoy more of the limonene terpenes. It’s honestly quite similar to Golden Goat in appearance and smell, which two different budtenders at L’Eagle said too. The smell has it’s own unique twist though that distinguishes it from Golden Goat a little bit. But the taste is what really stuck out to me, since you get a fairly strong lemon zest flavor all the way through, instead...”"

Definitely an old school aroma...just like opening that ziplock (we're talking mid-seventies weed and you're a teen...yup...that kinda smile) and sticking your nose right in.  I was only able to do a one hitter due to constraints of my job.  That being said, I was still able to got...”"
