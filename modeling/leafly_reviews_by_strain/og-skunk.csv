OG Skunk

GhostOfJack,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-skunk/reviews/1416661,"“This combines 2 of my favorite strains from 2 different decades.  I loved skunk #1 in the  late 90s and early 2000s  What I Love about skunk #1 is its versatility and resistance to tolerance.  Ive came across hundreds of strains in my life and some were great but often times the high thc strains became like drinking decaf after a few weeks of daily use.  S1 can be smoked morning, afternoon or evening, its downside is...”"

Fr4nck20,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-skunk/reviews/1396926,"“Clearly one of the dankest weed i have ever smoke. This shit smells like a death skunk and it gets you fucking damn high at the second the smoke is out of your mouth. The buds are little and dense. 5% leafs in the bag. I plaid basketball on this shit and i thought i was Kobe Bryant. This shit is good for homework, gaming, hanging out with friends or simply for an awesome adventure in the wild world  we're in.”"
CountOrlok,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-skunk/reviews/1410390,"“Definitely going on my favourites list. This has a nice pungent, citrus/fuel scent and tastes fantastic.  It's not a harsh smoke either.  The high is awesome. It's very uplifting yet relaxing. If you have work to do around the house, this bud's for you.  It definitely hits you in the head before the body but it's a smooth transition as it creeps on. No paranoia or anxiety with one, and I am susceptible to that with m...”"

First of all, I picked up THC-A sugar crystals by Venom Extracts. There's a very noticeable difference from THC & THC-A. Maybe you've seen some dispensaries selling it in the concentrates section, but it normally goes for $40-$60 per HALF gram! 
I scored 2 different half grams.
One small dab, and I mean small like the head of a pin, has me so baked it's crazy. Only $24 for the gram!
The...”"
emkaygee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-skunk/reviews/1359451,"“This strain smokes very nice-isn't too harsh on the lungs, and gives both wonderful cerebral and body effects. Was a little shocked when I originally smoked, because my dispensary had this labeled as an indica (I could see that if you smoke a lot in a row, but I feel the effects are more energizing and uplifting).”"
DenverSpaceCat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-skunk/reviews/1413388,"“This is the best sativa Ive found in Denver so far. Its a darker colored sativa hybrid. Its fluffier bud frosted in trichomes. Its a very arousing strain and is great for intimacy.  OG Skunk manages to be euphoric and uplifting, while also helping to relieve stress and anxiety. A rare find!”"

Valance,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-skunk/reviews/1365568,"“Super good strain for the super bowl! Hit one GB and felt the effects kick in almost immediately. Once you sit down you'll most likely not want to get back up, so get your drink before that because your mouth will be super dry! Good relaxing strain that made me very happy and laughy. Look at memes, even the dumb tom Brady ones will make you laugh!”"

AtlasApperatus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-skunk/reviews/1578402,"“Perhaps its because i grav-bonged a skunk strain, but i hated the flavor, loved the smell though, and the high was pretty intense after a couple grams.”"
1kushking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-skunk/reviews/1730527,"“This Hybrid was 60/40 Sativa dominate & gave me a clear headed high making me uplifted, happy, & mellow. Taste & smell was a skunky citrus. Buds had different shades of light medium green colors made lighter by all the white fuzzy hairs & trichomes caked on. Bright light orange pistils finished off the buds beautiful looks. ENJOY :)”"

After a week of severe depression and anxiety, and many dissociative episodes, I was able to get up take a shower and start cleaning my house. 
If I could keep the strain on stock forever, it would be right there next to my green crack and blue dream. No couch lock, and no weird headache, I did hyperfocus on whatever task I said before me. ...”"

The 60/40 sativa makes it hit the head real quick then the indica kicks in and relaxes the muscles. Leaving you with a headband feel but your still able to be productive.”"
