oglos420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gorilla/reviews/1399110,"“I was shocked to see that there were no reviews for this strain. White Gorilla is very potent and you feel the effects right away. Its very sedating and relaxing. I recommend this strain to those who suffer from pain, anxiety and insomnia.”"
marieAvevan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gorilla/reviews/1399109,"“I absolutely love this Strain. Immediate updates uplifted effects, and amazing focus and attention to detail. This definitely gets you up off the couch and motivates you to complete tasks. Overall sense of happiness, and all worries melt away. Everything seems manageable which is amazing for someone like me with ptsd, anxiety, and fibromyalgia. Nothing seems out of reach. The first two hours I felt the strongest effe...”"

VividChaos,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gorilla/reviews/1399112,"“This strain is a perfectly balanced hybrid.  Having an overactive brain, this is a great strain because it starts in your head.  It will slow down your thoughts and then a few minutes later you will end up with a fully body relaxation.

I have not experienced any couch lock with this strain, but it works well for the end of the day.  The fact that it hits the head and the body is great for winding down your day. Grea...”"

Yonex420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gorilla/reviews/1287410,"“I'm so glad I tried this out, not only has this helped me reduce muscle aches & pains, but it also calms my mind down and helps me fall asleep. The soothing euphoric effects kick in pretty fast, as well as opening my appetite.
 If you're planning on staying in for the evening & wanna just zone out, You gotta try this.”"

pkpdogg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gorilla/reviews/1331859,"“This stuff hits hard.  Single proper puff from firefly2 and I got full body tingles, bringing on good vibes and good times.  Super tasty pine flavor, but super strong odor, so this is definitely not one you can smoke in public without drawing attention.  Only real downside for me is my head feels really cloudy the next morning, making it a Fri/Sat-only strain.”"
christobur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gorilla/reviews/1372372,"“Strong high, no tiredness after. Only complaint is that it's a short high.”"

Furiousmagician,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gorilla/reviews/1335687,"“While this strain smells incredibly good it does leave a bit of a burnt effect on me. Making me incredibly sluggish for hours after the high wears off. Feels more like a straight indica if anything.”"

I love GG especially #4. never had white gorilla before and WOW. Such a great body and head high. sinking in the couch though so I feel a great indica release. love this series”"
Collusion,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gorilla/reviews/1657532,"“10/10 solid strain. Found the high feels like it's in your head for a couple minutes and then sinks down...not as "i can't be fucked to do anything" as gg4”"
VVavybon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-gorilla/reviews/1707234,"“Recently acquired this strain, for the second time.
The smell it produces is pungent, a little sweet, fruity, fragrant. It kind of reminds me of potpourri. 

This batch, as well as the last one, was A-1. Went with the pipe, over the bubbler. Each hit does not disappoint. Definitely at ease, after a long work day. Buds looked nice.

 It’s a strain that was good enough for me to write a review, after not doing so for 2...”"
