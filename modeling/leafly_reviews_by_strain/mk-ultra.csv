Smoke: rough, rough inhale and exhale just plain rough
Smell: like pine mixed with earth
Effects: fucking ridiculous. I smoked a 2g bowl all in one sitting. 10 mins later I had to take a number 2 and I sat there looking at my shower for 20 minutes then realized I didn't even use the bathroom. A little too intense of a feeling for me.
