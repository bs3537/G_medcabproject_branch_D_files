Cindy White

thedudemanseb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cindy-white/reviews/1368972,"“Fell in love with Cindy White immediately. A very potent strain with trichome covered resinous buds. It has a slightly earthy smell mixed in with some fruity and floral tones. The taste is amazing. When vaporized, it tastes a lot like some sort of haze variety combined with a slight fruity tingle that remains on the palate. A very nice sativa buzz that goes straight to the head and did a great job of relieving the pa...”"

I propagated this cut, and gave it out to places like the Green Solution + others.  TGS wanted to call it Cindy White because they  want to build their company media and press around it since it placed on previous competitions when other stores grew it.. They changed the name of green crack because it had a "negative connotation" says founder Eric Spidell. They changed the na...”"

defectata,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cindy-white/reviews/1374481,"“Tolerance got you down? Need some near-instantaneous elevation? 

Take a gander at this princess. She comes on strong and fast, giving a nice lift to the mood, a quick grin to the corners of your mouth, and a solid buzz to take you through your day. 

Very uplifting with considerable body effects as well. 5/5. 

SWADED”"
Livvey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cindy-white/reviews/1295441,"“Took five or so long drags from a vaporizer, not an immediate high. About 2-3 minutes in my head clears, I get relaxed and happy, things seem funnier. Very stress relieving no anxiety or paranoia. It does make it a little difficult to focus on speech or music but you won't care. 
Only three stars though bc about half of the time it will give me a headache so bad it rivals a migraine.”"
zellerpress,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cindy-white/reviews/1352083,"“Great sativa hybrid. I felt calmer, happier, and general euphoric feelings. Productivity wise, I didn't feel any couch-lock and was able to get some work done. 
I would definitely hit this up again and loved it in shatter form.”"
CodyCosmano,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cindy-white/reviews/1331605,"“Very tasty, smooth hitting in a pipe. Nice high to it that lasts. created alot of keif so I suggest this strain for keif collectors. It took pain away well and also helped me sleep.”"
mrcantgetenough,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cindy-white/reviews/1384926,"“Oh yeah! Will get you where you are going in a hurry! Not at all like Berry White! Very high resin!! I just took 3 big bowl hits! (.7 gram) and I am VERY high! Not a get up and go high but a kinda better hold on high! Very potent smell of 70's concert Mary Jane!”"

Speezy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cindy-white/reviews/1282029,"“At first glance you'll quickly see the White Widow genetics as the buds are frosty and crisp.  An easy smoke, Cindy White picked up my afternoons and made my daily routine a breeze.  Although the effects were not as long lasting or as strong as WW or Cinderella 99, combined the two strains genetics still make for a unique enjoyable high.”"
