The buds were mostly green with very obvious patches of purple. The bud shares the skunky grape smell and taste of grandaddy purple and related strains. Overall, an amazing nighttime strain worthy  of being compared to the relief p...”"

The high went to my head instantly and morphed into perfect mind/body relaxation.  The effects on the mind were mild and let me keep focus and kept me quite calm, happy and euphoric.  Sedative-like qualities were definitely present.  This is my new answer to having a night-time strain to enjoy that won't put me to sleep half-way...”"

It's helped my sleeping disorder greatly and it's helped the pain I have in my feet and joints from sports and ballet. I highly recommend it to anyone who has trouble sleeping, or who has any sort of chronic pain. The only downside was that I needed to smoke quite a bit before I felt anything. But that could be because I have a high tolerance and/or it wasn't grown well. I'm sure if it's gr...”"

The buzz sort of crept up on me but then it enveloped my whole body and brought calm into my mind. The high is somewhat sedating but not in a way that makes you sleepy or overly disinterested in doing things. If anything, after I smoked it, and read how low this strain was rated at my time of reading (5) and thought it deserved a little seri...”"

This strain is made even more enjoyable by the staff at Sante-Denver because they offer it in  prerolls! This strain is a great night time Indica to help with sleep, but it's also a nice strain to have at a relaxing get together if you aren't going to be partying this strain will really mellow you out! :-)”"

Strong skunk at first with a mixed berry/grape smell right after, then almost back to skunkiness. haha Good density to the buds, with not much stem at all! The smoke puts a nice lil smile on my face, earthy skunk with lush tasty grapes/berries on the end of the exhale! It made me feel alot less stressed and very happy and pleasant. Not to powerful of a buzz, but nice and tolerable....”"
