Hurricane

BerkshireBud52,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1390496,"“I found this to be a very cerebral and visual high. I was taking a ride in the Berkshires on a back road on a sunny day. Everything seemed more vivid, brighter and I found myself in deep thought and giggling to myself quite often. It is also a good body high as I also was relieved of pain from my back and arthritis. I am 64 and that is real good news. I only had a couple of hits and the high maintained its intensity ...”"

Green and purple leafs and crystals. relieves pain, creative, focused, it's a great strain. if u get a chance, grab as much as u can. it flies out the door!!!”"
JorgeG62,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1398861,"“Another great NETA effort, this is a gorgeous strain.  Deep forest green swirled with pale sea green, long eyelash like copper hairs, coated and shimmering in light-honey powdery crystals.  Sweet and fruity, resinous, peppery and hashy, excellent flavor.  Fairly potent, strong sativa qualities, talkative, giggly, but solid indica input for good pain relief, good daytime strain for those who can deal with a stronger b...”"
Usmafia808,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1363574,"“creative and motivational mentally,  but a very sedating body high. Maybe where the name comes from? haha
 Okay,  but not ideal for day use.. I keep zoning out and getting distracted.
The bud itself though is beautiful!!”"

Perfect time to try out hollistic medicine. 2 small bowls of Hurricane. Great relief for me😉.........and i almost didn't pick any up. Its not as long lasting as opiods but it worked for me. Now that i found a strain that works with my endocannibinoid system, the nxt step is dosing in mod...”"

Thank you NETA.  Lisa rocks.
Watched a fellow patient attempt to cover his grill - as if an invisible Hurricane was preventing his synapses from puzzling together the proper orientation of space-time cooktinuum.  Used a Bubbler for a smooth smoky med session.  Pleasing to 5/5 senses, ESPECIALLY the clear eyed  pain relief.  Reported 19.4% TAC, but beware!  This beautiful ...”"
ilikebikes,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1255304,"“very mellow and flavorful smoke. it is listed as indica at my local dispensary is mass, and smokes like one. it certainly is more stoney couch weed than something like an arcata TW or haze, but certainly no couchlock. works very well for headaches and have heard many reports of eye and sinus pressure relief”"

malmgrdc,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1309315,"“THIS is my new #1 daytime med when I feel like I need to calm down. Good anytime of the day really. Great sativa/indica balance. I'm in love.”"
sidewalkstonergirl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1388847,"“Perfect for pre-gaming a date you're not sure is a date but you want it to be one because you just found out your ex lives across the street from
your new place and you've so moved on to bigger and better things. Good energetic high without making you crazy or stupid or too hyped up that you can't stop cleaning your kitchen.
Beautiful flower and a good time all around.”"

chrispysays,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1269037,"“Definitely a favorite. All around good mood and uplifted. One of the most well balanced strains I've ever had, wonderful for anxiety while remaining focused and productive or lazy and relaxed. Beautiful dark purple and light green calyx make for a beautiful contrast.”"
Chimaera,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1295283,"“I got some Hurricane from my dispensary but it was labeled as an indica....I didn't do my research here so when I medicated I was greeted with a horrible jitteriness and inklings of anxiety as I am prone to get from vaping this dosage of a sativa. I went back to it at about 25% of my first dose and this gave me a nice mental acuity and focus to knock out a ton of errands and chores. Not the biggest fan of the flavor,...”"

Hurricane137,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1589416,"“Hurricane is my daily go-to source for anxiety and stress relief.  I first tried it in flower form, but now I have switched to concentrates.  Thank you NETA for continuing to offer this medicine to us.  Big shout out to all the friendly folks at NETA.  If you haven't tried Hurricane and you see it somewhere it's worth giving a shot, especially if you enjoy being mellow.  Cheers!”"
ThisOneTimeAtUmass,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1325400,"“Solid daytime strain with pretty purple buds. The high is a bit slow/creeper style but builds to a heavy cerebral effect with some trailers/visuals. The body effects are lighter, but general pain and muscle tension is reduced. More mellow than euphoric, but very much an UP high with fun body tingles.”"
camgrant,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1304698,"“Never heard of Hurricane before but this is a good active, cerebral high. It's parent is LA Affie, which is surprising because I don't see the resemblance. It has a spicy sweet, herbal exhale and can leave a lingering tingle in your nostrils. This strain does lean a bit heavily on the sativa side for me but I don't mind. Overall good strain for anytime of the day.”"

jemichaels,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1626553,"“This is the first strain I vaped after a long month of extreme anxiety, depression and general lack of liveliness. Boy what a good start it was. Nothing too wild but really perfect for just feeling positive about things. Everything feels quite worth doing actually and I can focus pretty well, more specifically prioritizing what is most important. No memorable smell or taste but the Sativa-dominant balance is incredib...”"

I struggled to hang on to a cerebral ride that was speedy, an altered focus, enhanced vision, talkative, creative. This strain is very different from my go to as there is no euphoria or happiness. Forget relaxing, be prepared to do something. Colors are more vibrant and field view opens up dramatically. It felt like visual hal...”"
Atlashrggd11864,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1806806,"“At just under 16% THC I find this to be a very cerebral strain. 15 minutes in to some healthy bong hits and it went right to my head literally. visually my eyes felt wide-open like really wide open. It’s definitely a sativa it’s uplifting energizing an overall happy sense of well-being. 
I would definitely recommend this for daytime use as I’m ready to go at it with my green tea which by the way It pairs well with th...”"

7an3na,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1275359,"“Gives a very chill full-functioning high. It alleviates aches for most of the day, especially when vaped in the early morning. I've started to mix this with the Girl Scout Cookies and it is the most relaxing, motivating high I've experienced!”"
NerdyMo420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1288898,"“Pretty nice sativa. Not the best tasting, but not horrible-very earthy. The high was uplifting and euphoric with a slight energetic buzz. Didn't experience anxiety or paranoia. Good strain for fighting depression, anxiety, and fatigue.”"
lissa,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1290470,"“My dispensary sells this as a hybrid. The buds are nicely frosty and have purple leaves. The aroma is sweetly floral with spicy undertones, and the taste is like roasted sweet peppers. This is a good daytime strain because it gives me a nice indica body relaxation to quell my anxiety and nausea but keeps me alert for running errands; I prefer something more energetic and creative for work.”"
Bia217,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1299568,"“Fantastic sativa! This is a giggly, uplifting, good-time strain. It's great for day time use but nothing too serious because keeping a straight face could be difficult.”"
canadianotter,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1370778,"“I suffer from anxiety and said anxiety causes me stress and depression. I have tried a lot of strains before and they all at least in a small amount amplify my anxiety. This does not. I can normaly only take a very small hit so the anxiety doesnt overwhelm me. With this i can take a full milkshot and everything is just better. Its hard to describe but i tend to obsess over a issue until it is resolved. With this i ju...”"
Zissy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1444205,"“I will give it 4 stars. I actually love the aroma it has a Fall type scent. It's a nice mellow high and I will take another milky white hit soon. I'm bongin' it.”"
bleafnmiracles,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1270734,"“Sold as an indica at my dispensary, definitely acts like one. Great for day time pain relief, although this strain does produce a strong body sensation it won't put you to sleep. I live with chronic pain and have found Hurricane to be reliable medicine even in lower concentrates of active content. The sativa effects do come through quite strongly (and quickly, probably leading to its name) sometimes being very cerebr...”"

JohnnyMixxxx,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hurricane/reviews/1274654,"“This shit is pretty good.  Got me and the woman pretty horny and ended up having a long fuck session after smoking a blunt.  Was great for taking naps cause we both passed out after sex.  Has a good taste and smell to it.  I found that keeping it in the freezer gives it an extra bit of flavor and kick.

BEST SHELL TO SMOKE WITH: BLUEBERRY
HOW LONG HIGH LASTED: 20-40 MINUTES
MOODS: RELAXED, AWAKE, VIDEO GAMES”"
