I got only 2g last week and have made it last (she did grind up beautifully) - sadly all good things come to an end.  Here we have a strain ideal for smoking through the day.  I'm not really sure the high ends at all, and if it does it tapers off graaadually.  I haven't really been not high in a week.  However , i have failed to do anything productive.  upon Completion of small tasks...”"

This stain is a one hit and all the pain has gone.  I recommend this for everyone that is smoking weed to reduce pain  
Keep on getting stoned

Fuck the buds were about 2x1.5cm long buds however they were dense as hell one bud weighed up to 1.2 after snapping one of the superbly sugary buds in half revealed the denseness back to the superbly sugary comment, these things literally stuck my metal grinder together they green when ground is a medium pale green/white however the sugar literally swept the bud white.

Pearsie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/armageddon/reviews/1065653,"“Earthy smell, got in rather small buds that were broken down again and again, felt so fluffy that it almost felt wet, but it wasn't. Exploded in a grinder, although it wasn't broken down too well. Smoked through a standard Basil Bush ~1ft bong with a small layer of tobacco to stop the weed from dropping through until it's been burnt (Droppies, as we call them here). Very good if you've had a bad day.”"

UKCheeseFan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/armageddon/reviews/1362799,"“I picked about a gram of this up and the effects really creep up on you. I smoked it in a park with my buddy, but we parted ways after smoking the joint. I felt pretty normal and went to sit on a bench. I sat on the bench and a slow wave of numbness go from my toes eventually to my tongue. As I was new to smoking and it was a potent strain, I started to feel slightly sick, but I also think I was getting a bit paranoi...”"
chimpalahee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/armageddon/reviews/1457451,"“Don't underestimate this weed as it takes a while to kick in which can make you smoke more to feel the effect, but when it does it hits you hard and can make you anxious as your ego starts to dissolve into itself. Just embrace the altered state of reality if you get paranoid and wait until the heady high wears off to leave you with a relaxed body high. Lasts a while too, around 6 hours.”"
megajah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/armageddon/reviews/1065644,"“Overall one of my favorite strains, always frosty with a good strong head high.”"
ValRocha,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/armageddon/reviews/1149672,"“Got some of this with my best friend, as the last weed we smoke before winter break. I am not a huge fan as it makes me too tired, and life wears me out too much already for weed to make me tired too! Smells nice and woodsy! Really great for relaxing and not doing anything though.”"

Euphoriant,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/armageddon/reviews/1155901,"“Comes on with a pretty heavy cerebral high at first, can make you anxious/paranoid if taken in large doses, wouldn't recommend to beginners. Lasts about an hour then mellows out to a really relaxed buzz for about 2 hours. Tastes nice.”"
