I got the bottom of the jar of some other bud, which had some of this mixed in with it. Holy smokes! I got high, two hours later I drove home once it ebbed and it hit again when I got home.

Very gentle smoke, and within minutes cleared my "Fibro Fog" and got rid of my muscle spasms (head/torso) and my headache dissolved. I was able to focus and have energy to do my light web work I do.

The S.A.G.E I smoke is 24% THC, with inconsequential amounts of CBD, CBG, etc.  I usually prefer indicas but this strain is absolutely amazing.  Almost instantly you get hit with a little uplifting euphoric push, which turns into this extremely functional, clear-headed high. I have terrible anxiety (which sativas usually in...”"

The nugs are not dense, but cotton ballish and seemingly made up mostly of pale orange hairs. It smells awesome, like a bright pine autumn day, haha.

Testing at 23.35% and WOW is this feeling incredible. It goes right to your head and then slowly descends down your body. It literally does give you a calming effect. I wish things weren't so restricted and exspensive here because if I could I'd buy weight of this. Don't pass it up if you get a chance!!!”"
cdysinge,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sage/reviews/1102320,"“Damm this is a potent strain. It makes you focus but in a weird way. While you are focused on something it is a disorganized focus. You lock onto the task but it takes a lot longer to accomplish. I love this strain but would not reccomend it to anyone looking for a productive high. Its great for movies or for me Call of Duty on my PS3. You focus so hard on the game you almost feel like you are there.”"

It's rare that you find a strain that can eliminate pain without knocking you out or nailing you to the couch.  S.A.G.E. works double duty for both issues, it's long lasting with the added mental clarity bonus. This is now my daytime go-to for joint and nerve pain.”"
