Snow Ryder
=============
FoggyTheCloud,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-ryder/reviews/1375112,"“Great strain for relaxing, insomnia and muscle spasms.

This stain, starts with a subtle high, gives instant stress-relief and about half an hour later a deep relaxing feeling invades the body.

The only downside is that It can make you very light-headed if you overdo it, since it also has a diuretic effect that could lead to some weird situations.”"
