Been trying a lot of 1:1 type strains lately. Leafly does a piss poor job of categorizing these and CBD dom strains. Come on meow, it's metadata. Throw some of your wads of cash at it, we know you're huge pimpin the legal lettuce scene.”"
norcal4ever,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/in-the-pines/reviews/1397036,"“I decided to try this strain because of its high CBD content. It acted fast on my migraine pain, although it was not the best pain relief I've experienced from MJ. I'd say it took my pain about 75% away in the first 20 minutes, and the other 25% gradually faded away in about 45 minutes.
 
The best (and unexpected) part about this strain was how it affected my anxiety. I have never, never, EVER felt as calm and peacef...”"
munkeijoe,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/in-the-pines/reviews/1333586,"“one of my favorite strains right now. If you're in the SF/bay area a delivery company called Flow Kana has it as a high cbd with 12.6% cbd and 7.7% thc. Absolutely my new all day smoke. great taste, great high for being low in thc, and add the body pain relief from the almost 13% cbd, and it's perfection.”"
slackvana,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/in-the-pines/reviews/1410990,"“One of the better CBD strains in AZ right now. Fresh tasting bud, and it does smell like you are in a 🌲 🌲 🌲. CBD strains are still getting established, so I'm holding out the elusive 5⭐️ until I find a CBD strain that's reached its potential.”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/in-the-pines/reviews/1510976,"“Wow, great sativa come on. Brightens eyes up nice and wide while feeling extra chipper. Enthusiastic euphoria-fueled energy surges from deep inside. The mind can be felt unwinding, drifting off into the clouds. A largely competent, “with it” kind of high that evokes a unique sense of place. It’s got an especially nostalgic bent combined with visual and incredible auditory stimulation creates a mostly impressive and p...”"

I dunno if its the same but the description matches it perfectly.
Looks: Long buds with a tangle of yellow hairs and lots of milky trichs.  a nice red/yellow/green color to them very nice.
Smell: Verry odd and hard to explain, super tropical/pineappley but also a distinct piney diesel undertone from the master kush im guessing. Taste and smell were identical.
Effects: A nice energy boos...”"

LadyElsa,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/in-the-pines/reviews/1467150,"“I have Chronic Fatigue, and this is the most energizing strain I have ever had. After just a few hits, I feel much better and suddenly have the motivation to do things! This strain smells AMAZING, and it is energizing without making you foggy-headed.

A great strain for wake n baking, because you’ll have a productive start to the day. Also fantastic for afternoon smoking and creative endeavors.

I am a sativa lover a...”"

rainyram,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/in-the-pines/reviews/1371130,"“My favorite strain of all time. so relaxed, focused and creative. It helps my writing tenfold and improves critical thinking. its really eye opening, with a comfortable body high.”"

Only issue is that this is HORRIBLE for anyone with any sort of breathing problem. (More so than normal!)

That's it from me!

The kind with an apple on the end of it so instead of wintery I changed my tune to tropical.  Easy mistake having enjoyed another sativa dominant strain called "Pine Drop" just the day before it was an easy mix up. 

The slightly fruity notes were faint & meshed into the predominant  flavor which reminded me ...”"

The taste was great, as was the smell. Very sweet and light.

The high was weird. A great happy feeling at first, then comes laser sharp focus for 10 minuets, then comes a bit of dizziness, then comes muscle relaxation that makes you want to do nothing.

It's an OK strain..I wouldn't use it for any serious activity beyond laundry.”"

I was pleasantly surprised to find that a CBD "high" is its own incredible experience. It took a short 15 minutes for it to kick, but I can say once it did I have never had such a clear mind accompanied by freakishly large stores of energy. Sometimes we forget how nice it feels to just have a clear head and the air is crystal clear in...”"

It's not super heady but just enough to get you thinking and with the body relaxation you can't ask for more.”"
KTram,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/in-the-pines/reviews/1420251,"“Excellent strain for chronic pain. It also gives a nice touch of energy wrapped in a blanket of focus and readiness. It's pretty calm on the mental side, but you can definitely tell it's there. Great for an early afternoon started on a Saturday with things to do, but relaxation after. I would suggest the strain leaves you with a feeling of excitement. Glad I got an ounce of this particular strain, that's for sure.”"

The only reason I gave it three stars was it did cause some dizziness for me that didn't allow me to go about my day.”"

I like to share, and it's a hit with my friends.  I don't feel blazed out, or super munchie.  I can totally function through the day with "in the pines."  I will have to agree with another reviewer, it's a great anxiety killer. Time for another puff and yoga!!”"

It also is a great strain for treating pain without any sedation. Also good for mild depression.This strain is a 1 to 1 meaning that it has an almost equal amount of cbd to thc rratio. This gives you a very mild psychoactive high. I would recommend this weed for anytime you want to feel high, but without much of...”"
