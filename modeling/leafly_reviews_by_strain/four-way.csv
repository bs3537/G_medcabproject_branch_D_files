Its blissful, POWERFUL indica effects have made Four Way THE go-to strain for this stoner, whether its 1998 in Virginia or 2018 in Was...”"

Sedation comes on quick, right after my first vape, 15 mins later, more intensifying.  Also can be a chore to keep your eyes opened well as keeping your eyes opened.
No negatives notes
No anxiety or paranoia.


Only tried once, will leave more re pain, etc, one I try it again in next few days.”"

Couldn't keep my eyes opened, and super tired. 

I will post more as I try it again later, re pain, paranoid, etc later.   

Have GAD and PTSD and there is no Anxiery or Paranoia.”"
