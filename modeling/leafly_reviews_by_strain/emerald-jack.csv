Then there's this stuff. I hate to speak ill of greenbud, especially stuff that 20 years ago would have knocked my socks off, but compared to the other strains I've tried, this is just "meh". The high is heavy-headed, full-body and no-energy; if this is what you're after then be of good cheer, because ...”"
Markiwanna,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/emerald-jack/reviews/1417559,"“This strain is made for me.  Good for biking or hiking or housework, or anything that requires the mellow motivation to get it done with a smile on your face.  Just when you're getting productive, however, you'll be randomly changing dimensions and doing weird robot moves and stuff.”"

nickrazza,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/emerald-jack/reviews/1414249,"“SO many good things about this strain, but we'll stick to the solid three that truly make this a 5/5 without it being the most potent or looking like it was rolled in sugar.

1. Emerald OG & Jack Herer first off, are great parents!
As far as sativa's go, this is what you're looking for. Simple as that. Has that nice sweet smell and taste, strong punch due to high THC count, and if grown well you'll see what its a pla...”"

Made me to feel a bit Anxious & UpTight, this lasted for Several Hours. Man, was I happy as hell when this wore off!!!  I "sence" the grow I bought was Over-Cloned. Pre-packaged & dry as lettuce.

Body high perfect. Energetic enough to walk to the store in the snow! This one must be a Satvia dominant. Love a good worker bud! Head high moderate but smooth & not overwhelming. Wouldn't suggest for nighttime use; may keep ya up. Highly recommend for daytime use!”"

Nugs smell really sweet like sugar, and when broken up smells like sweet skunk.”"
Peppermints,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/emerald-jack/reviews/1188609,"“This strain is insanely good if you need cleared headed sativa energy, but it is strong.  beautifully buds, all of them, with amazing flavor.  top shelf like this at $10/g is a steal.”"

It was one of my better tasting strains. For me the taste itself is kinda addictive. I want to keep vaping just for the flavor. It leaves a wonderful citrusy lavender after taste after the exhale.
