I have a high tolerance and a few hits of this SWEET BABY JANE and that's all I needed to medicate effectively.  I have severe insomnia and this strain HELPS immensely!!!!  Def. helps with fibro and arthritic pain as well!!  Also helps increase appetite!!!  I would describe this strain as more earthy for a flavorful smoke with a hint of citrus.  I also has a hint of...”"
TalibDwelli,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-baby-jane/reviews/1363889,"“Wow is she so sweet!  The buds are super dense with incredibly swollen resin glands cover every inch of the flower.  This strain has a nice aroma that blends citrus notes as well as the smell of the forrest on a rainy day.  Being mostly an indica smoker, this strain is perfect for me.  Super sedative and relaxing; a perfect way for me to melt into the couch and watch a movie or TV show and relax after a long days wor...”"

smaddy07,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-baby-jane/reviews/1394779,"“Perfect Indica for me. Can take a few puffs in the morning and tame anxiety or before bed to get me to sleep. Happy, relaxed, a great strain for emotional release. Makes me chatty. Wonderful insight came to me on several occassions while burning through an 1/8. So, I got a quarter and it is still treating me so so fine.”"

beachlvr_129,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-baby-jane/reviews/1413466,"“This is great for relaxing! I sleep like a baby.  It takes away muscle spasms.  Also helps with Multiple Sclerosis pain.  I vape it, all I need is a couple hits and I'm feeling the best I do all day.”"
EL444,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-baby-jane/reviews/1397962,"“Doesn't present as the prettiest flower I've seen by any means but it smokes smooth. It's a great, typical indica that def helped me eat and sleep but wasn't exactly fantastic for pain. I still gave it five stars tho because it absolutely works for appetite which hit me the very first hit despite my high tolerance. And great for sleep! Oh btw, I'd not suggest this if you're single. Very high on the arousal side too.”"

AliciaHughes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-baby-jane/reviews/1652735,"“I love this strain. I was praised that It  was reccomend & I choose it. It's the best stain of flower so far I've purchased through my local dispensary. I would recommend it to any patients who suffer with sleeping disorders like insomnia. It was also welly described in this description. When I first took this medicine I definitely felt a "creeper" like effect and anxieties raised but very shortly after I was in imme...”"

tylersb99,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-baby-jane/reviews/1605873,"“it was a great high, but it was a little short lived. The feelings that gave you was beyond explanation. This is one of the best highs i ever had. I smoked three blunts and four bowls of this and then I was at the skatepark skating and I just had the greatest time of my life. the only thing I would say is wrong with it is I wish the high would last longer.”"

Lynes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-baby-jane/reviews/1569896,"“Was incredibly harsh, had lots of stems, made me feel groggy, foggy, and EXTREMELY unmotivated. Unmotivated as in stirring pasta felt like an unimaginable chore. Also after smoking solely this strain for a few days the high started to bring on feelings of depression and and overwhelming anxiety and negative thoughts. The only upside to this strain is that for an indica it sure does what it’s supposed to.. knock you o...”"
