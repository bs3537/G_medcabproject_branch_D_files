It smells sweet, like actual mango, and it'll even leave a sweet smell on your fingers after loading it. It hits really smooth and gives me a relaxing high while also making me very clever with puns 😂 best weed for a day out at the beach!”"

HelenKellerwilliams,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-mango-haze/reviews/1393388,"“Incredibly blissful. Relaxing but not entirely sedating. Best taste of any strain I've ever had when vaped. I have never experienced any anxiety or paranoia on this strain and I can be sensitive. Not sure why this one hasn't blown up yet. Get your hands on it!”"

Al I did was smile and when I caught myself smiling, I smiled even more. If you want to feel happy and for me I didn't have any negative effects with this, I would definitely try this one. I also suffer from PTSD so right now this is HIGH on my list of ones to use again.I have a few ot...”"

I use it at the office.  I'll take just one pull from the hash pen and be focused like a Jedi for a couple hours.  At first I was nervous "are people going to know I'm high?"  As it turns out, nobody will know or care.  I think if they found out, they'd probably want some because I'm so da...”"

I’m not a paranoid person so I looked it up on leafly and saw the negatives — well that explains it! Yeah, it’s a no for me. ;)”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-mango-haze/reviews/1387573,"“Beautiful, top shelf strain. It's happy, invigorating, but not racy. Makes me happy to sit and chat, watch TV, or run errands. I wouldn't necessarily go to this strain before physical activity, but otherwise it's absolutely dynamite for wake and bake. Just... happy and alert in a big warm hug. Tastes delicious too. 👍”"

Felt very uplifted, talkative, and awake. Then smoked it before yoga and felt slightly paranoid, hyper, a little heart racing. Wouldn’t recommend this strain for focused activities lol. Colors pop a ton and music sounds great though.”"
sophia234,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-mango-haze/reviews/1412613,"“I didn't smoke too much but a few hits had me pretty energetic and moving around. I smoked some before bed and actually had a hard time falling asleep which is great for a Sativa, unfortunate for me that night :) Smells amazing. No anxiety or paranoia. Just a calm yet energetic feeling for a few hours.”"

I wouldn't say the taste is my favorite, but it is up there. It smells amazing though and the high is a euphoric lovers heaven. I took a couple good hits and I am just sitting here, listening to Dave Matthews Band in my garage just super chill and happy. but I am also able to get up and be a little p...”"
inditiva0,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-mango-haze/reviews/1383426,"“This very unique smelling and tasting bud consistently sits around only 15% THC, but it still packs a pretty good punch. Fruity and piney with a happy, focused head high.”"

Fullyman1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-mango-haze/reviews/1321855,"“Good times strain right here! screw the anti depressant meds, cuz this is all u need! upbeat,relaxing,hazey type of stone. smells amazing, flavors are good too. more of a hybrid to me though,racey at first like sativa but mellows out nicely to relaxation town. 4 out of 5 cuz it's more hybrid like if you will,for those looking for straight sativa. mine was only 13% but still dank shit! goes to show you don't need 30% ...”"
jesfos,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-mango-haze/reviews/1362523,"“I decided to try this because it is an award winning strain. Once I smelled it I was sooo excited to try this. Smells amazing! The taste doesn't have the same pleasentness. Tastes very chemically to me. I didn't like the high much. I kept mumbling and felt sooo stupid. Doesn't help with anxiety because I was getting sooo frustrated with my speech.”"
dankswonder,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-mango-haze/reviews/1372110,"“This is a great daytime strain with a great haze effect!! Tastes like a Hi-C juice box and is one of the smoothest hits we have ever had!!”"
cd1990,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-mango-haze/reviews/1340451,"“This strain is tricky. If you smoke just a little, you'll get a nice, uplifting High.

If you smoke just a moderate amount however, you'll be fucked up. 

It tastes great and each mug has a beautiful hue of red trichomes.

Shout out to Liberty Reach for this fine grow”"

I just know this one makes me REALLY social. My wife kept telling me to STOP talking lol. But wow, brain was working non-stop!  Wrote down some great ideas. Kinda had some stupid thoughts at first, then pure excitement from there”"
premiumbliss,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-mango-haze/reviews/1330775,"“What can i say about this fruity delicious sativa that hasnt already been said? It smells divine, STRONG mango strawberry flavor on the exhale. Such a beautiful high, chilled me out but kept you alert enough to enjoy a few documentaries a little more than i would otherwise. This strain just plain makes you HAPPY. It doesnt come around very often so I better go re-stock before it all gets snatched up!”"

Fullyman1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-mango-haze/reviews/1317320,"“buzzy and stoney best 2 words to describe this. smells incredibly like mangoes, taste good to. very haze like high with a heavy stone feel at same time. batch I got was only 13% but it did the job, I could see going on hike or doing mundane shit focused on this. would give it 5 stars but guess I'm more of a diesal guy.”"
kafishe6,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-mango-haze/reviews/1528154,"“Love this strain! Picked it up in cartridge form and it is smooth with a sweet taste. Makes for a very happy and pleasant high. I didn't feel anxious at all.”"
