Samtheman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-buddha/reviews/1359393,"“On top of smelling delicious and looking gorgeous this bud gives you an intense body high. I'm a bigger fan of indicas than most everyone I know. However I would recommend this to anyone. For most people it would be a perfect night time/ relaxation tool. 

However if you are into meditation or yoga, or anything like that, this purple Buddha is the perfect accessory (and this has nothing to do with the name). How we...”"

The first effects were some euphoria, skin tingling, and a nice sense of comfort or relaxation.  It didn't take much longer for us to realize that we were pretty much stuck to our seats watching BBC's Blue Planet on blu-ray.  

   When I say "sofa glue" and "stuck to our seats" I really mean it.  Like most weed, you also get the...”"

Trulyexte,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-buddha/reviews/1180071,"“Acabo de fumar el equivalente a una pastillita de Tic-Tac. El humo fue suave pero no resartó ningún sabor, o no uno que me llamara la atención. Inmediatamente sentí el golpe en mi cabeza, que se puso liviana y clara. Luego de que la hierba se tomó sus minutos, el portazo inicial se alivianó y  comencé a entrar en un estado de relajación muy intenso, combinado con una suerte de pesadez en el pensamiento, por lo que es...”"

The phenotype we got is VERY medicinal. I picked up some of this from a local dispensary and was tricked because it smelled so differently. Nice grower and all of the phenos seem to be medicinal by nature. Overall beautiful plant!!”"

The most positive part about this strain is that you can remain functional throughout your day, plus there is no groggy morning wake up if you smoke the night before.”"
