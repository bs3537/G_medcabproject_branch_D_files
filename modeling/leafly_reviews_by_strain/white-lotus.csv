buckrogers3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1380132,"“This is complex, unique and potent. The smell of the smoke is hashy, smooth and has a slightly sweet citrus-herb taste that is really interesting because it reminds me of Bombay Sapphire gin. Its super strong but its NOT going to give you a creative burst of energy or get you motivated to get stuff done. It seems to help you relax and relieve some body aches and pains while chasing away some of the blues also.”"

The full effects of this powerful stains property's  do not come on until about 10 to 15 min after smoking, this is wh...”"

SirMaxwellus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1334918,"“This strain is known for its solid yield, insane frost with wild Alpine berries aromas and warm tart hashy taste. The Snow Lotus male is the star child of Afgooey (Maui Haze x Afghani) and a X19 leaning Blockhead male (no Sweetooth traits present), he lets the female traits pass through in a cross while uping the size, structure, frost, and potency.”"

beautys1tragedy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1416585,"“Nice flavor, smooth hit but can be harsh if rushed. Chill vibe yet not necessarily sleepy. Great for dabbing w a friend and just hanging out for a few hours.”"
KidKaimera,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1255786,"“It come is after a 15 minute delay and clouds your senses. Sticks around for about an hour of munchies then eases its tender grasp over your head. The after effects of the high will linger but only after an hour or so of smoking.”"
TooFarGon3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1718848,"“Great Strain, I was in a shitty mood the whole day but then I got a hold of this and I feel great, and I’m chilling with my boys having a great time and laughing at everything.”"

NorseQueen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1681779,"“Wowie zowie!! I smoked a small bowl of this strain for the first time yesterday and it was completely amazing! I'd had a few things in my place go tits up in the last few days and had just gotten the news that it was going to be another few days before things could be fixed. I also had only gotten 6 hours sleep in the previous 2 days, so I really needed something exactly like this. After a couple of tokes of this, I ...”"

NikkxBaby223,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1360150,"“Super hashy taste will a little after taste of sweet citrus. The High is amazing and calming, definitely can't go wrong with this strain.”"

kanna37,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1351956,"“This one is a little tough for me.  I think I'm sticking with a 3.8 score.  The reason is that it made my mood worse.  However, it worked wonderfully for the inflammation, so it is definitely good medicine.  I definitely encourage others to try it - just because it made my mood worse, doesn't mean it will for everyone, and the medical value it holds certainly outweigh the mood problem possibilities, especially if the...”"

Kaitlyn5683,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1727768,"“This was the first strain I smoked after not smoking for 5 years. I have really bad anxiety/panic about everything but this keeps it pretty calm most of the time. I prefer this one for a few puffs for bed as it does make me pretty sleepy. It really does relax your whole body and you can feel yourself sinking a little bit.”"
Foksthery,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1323316,"“Updating my review.  Only sometimes causes nerve pain.  Other times causes tinnitus.  However, it smells and tastes like incense and that alone is worth occasionally indulging.”"
masterkief91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1338707,"“Very clean high, kept me energetic. My girlfriend and i were very giggly after just 1 joint. definitely a good strain to try.”"
Ultimate86Man,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1762402,"“For someone looking for a Blue Dream Hybrid Alternative, White Lotus does exactly that and then some! Neither of the 2 bus listed above will give you energy, but the difference is the Focus with the Euphoria instead of just some Euphoria and some focus, which to me is a clear difference. If your looking for a strain of Cannabis which will help with: Depression, Anxiety, Focus, Pain, Euphoria then White Lotus is an ex...”"
thcterrorist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-lotus/reviews/1170225,"“I don't know what you guys were smoking but the White Lotus I got from a certain someone demolished my brain. I could do all the basic functions but the rest of my brain was an add on I didn't quite have the money to pay for if you know what I'm saying... Best strain I've ever had the fortune to huff ... Oh and not to mention the munchies.... Holy H Christ I couldn't take my eyes off the fridge”"

Looking forward to this wearing off.”"
