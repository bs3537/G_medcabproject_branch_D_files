BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chem-dog/reviews/1568401,"“THAT TASTE!
I usually couldn't care less about the taste as long as it's potent. But this is a nice little treat. 
For me the high is obviously indica. Gives you a nice relaxing body buzz great for Netflix & chill. 
If you can find this strain pick it up if you need a good night sleep, but make sure you're actually getting this strain.”"
