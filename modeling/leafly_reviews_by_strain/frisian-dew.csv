Found it has many successful interactions with other symptoms of other medical conditions.  Will add photos of this to allow you to identify the strain from fakes.”"
dddjnoise5,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1346687,"“Super easy to grow outdoor! Smell is very exotic, mango, pine, peppery. Taste is more pine and licorice. High is perfectly 50/50 head and body sensations. Very tingly and euphoric, but if you stop moving you will feel very sedated and drowsy. Overall it's good, but definitely more of a evening bud.”"
bitterdregs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1159779,"“This is the only strain I hVe found that completely wipes out pain. The first 20 to 15 minutes will erase anxiety. After that the pain aspect kicks in. Feels like there is a coolest being sprayed through your body. Then the pain is gone, I have MS,fibromyalgia, arthritis, sciatica and severe IB, on top of comp,ex PTSD and anxiety. This strain works for all of it ! I never wNt to be without Frisian again.”"
stonejeffrico,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1243121,"“Light, good smell - not too strong. Feeling the effects from smoking rather fast, other strains take double the time.
Very relaxing, but thankfully doesn't put me to sleep. Makes me laugh a lot, also getting an incredible focus. More on the side of a body high, however head high not neglectable. All in all a pretty good strain, if it wasn't for the awful dry mouth I constantly get, it could be higher on my personal f...”"
lovesativa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1376162,"“AutoFrisian Dew is a AutoFem variety developed outdoors in Holland and especially developed for outdoor growing in Northern climates.

A friend of mine growed it by himself. The plant was beautiful! The taste as well as the smell are awesome... Some kind of lemon very fruity... 

I just vaped it and loved the aroma, but the high was a strong body stoned and made me nervous, anxious and depressed. I vaped it about 3-4...”"
azmiked,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1223468,"“The batch I had the pleasure of smoking/vaping came from TCC in Mesa. The flat buds were a dark forest green with a few seeds in each one. Not much to look at, but after vaping a bowl in my Arizer Solo I was high high high! Oh man, no lie this flower is Very potent! It has a clean piney, slightly fruity flavor and leaves you with a powerful head high, loads of creative thinking and tons of energy.  What a sleeper she...”"
NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1266752,"“Great flavor I think it feels like more of an upbeat strain. I mean there's flavors of pine, earth,  both of which are pretty relaxing and euphoric but there's still an energy that get you up and going. There's a pleasant pressure in the temples and a heaviness to the eye lids but no real body buzz. I got a really good deal on some Frisian Dew crumble that came in at just about 90% it had nice flavor and cost 25$ a g...”"

9/10 i would rate it:D”"
BrokenReverie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1266642,"“This strain is my all time favorite. Had it once in the Monterey Bay area in cali from tranquilityhealthcollecrive,  beautiful buds with purple hues and fiery orange hairs.  This strain has a perfect balance of 50/50 that will leave you with a clear headed euphoric high and a great relaxing body stone (great for anxiety)”"
zelliette,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1238043,"“Good strain for depression, fruity and tasty.”"
Tuckered,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1246352,"“Juniper.  Tastes and smells like juniper.

Frisian Dew makes my body tingle all over, right down to my naughty bits.  Also produces ridiculously heady concentration, bordering on zoning out, great for very long meditation...but BEWARE of the paranoia!  This strain often awakens demons I had long forgotten, and can escalate a trivial worry into a looming crisis.”"
mrplantastic420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1231887,"“smoked both purple and green bud from this strain. friend of a friend grew it outdoor in north european climate. wet and cold. couldnt believe the return from plant and beautiful smoke. excellent for depression”"

Butler445,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1255404,"“Impressed by the quality and potency of this outdoor strain. Nice green/purple looking buds, mine room will fill up with a lovely citrus/skunky smell when I open the jar. The smoke is good, It tastes like fresh pine with skunky and citrus undertones. The effects are on your body as well on your mind. Makes me feel happy and relaxed, great for the evening while watching a movie.”"
ThankfulfortheNature,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1592311,"“I can't even imagine what would have been my life today if I didn't grow this strain... It helped me a lot dealing with depression.
Not to strong, colourful strain with a summer taste, if you suffer from depression you can stop here, it's in my opinion one of the best strains to fight against lack of happiness.
Combine it with a physical activity is what saved me :)”"
Frisiandude,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1671134,"“One of the best strains for outdoorgowing in northren climates. Especially bred for the wet climate in the "frisian landscape" in northern Netherland/Germany near the north sea. Finisches ealry with massive yield and the best bud to leaf ratio i´ve erver seen outdoors. 

The High is strong for outdoor weed  - no wonder it´s a super skunk cross. At frist the indica hits you, later on you will enjoy a nice mellow uplif...”"
DankerTanker2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1730245,"“I’m from America but was blessed to try this bud from Holland by a local dispensary with it in stock. The buds I got were dense and coated with trichomes, the leaves themselves being a mixture of lush green and deep purple. This strain provides a pleasant and uplifting head high while providing subtle focus and clarity. It also allows for an incredible amount of relaxation. I suffer from chronic muscle pain related t...”"

neonsub420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1163173,"“Nice low budget weed tryed in holland needs 250% in comparasen to normal dose but for €5 per gram it was money well spent”"
Fenrir612,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1320389,"“Cheap where i got it from $20 for an 1/8 and you get a bang for your buck. It taste alot like Black Licorice which i really like but not a popular flavor among most people. Really made me relaxed but also Focused. Only Issue i Had were some Muscle Spasms in my legs. But overall I really Liked this Bud.”"
kajkush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1249406,"“Not a super strain, but I probably think it isnt that good because i grew it myself outdoors. (they were my first plants). not so dense buds, but the effects are nice.”"
Polly333,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-dew/reviews/1442826,"“For pain, particularly crohn's and MS, this variety can't be beat.  Any bowel or nervous systems disorders. Frisian will first give you a buzz and about 15 minutes later produce the pain killing effect. I don't mean you can deal with the pain...I mean it REMOVES the pain.  It it euphoric and good for sleep, but functional too so good for day or night. This is hands down my favorite cannabis ever. For growing, it pref...”"
