curiousgeorge03,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-power/reviews/1386706,"“Fantastic smoke - gives you an intense bussing sensation from only 3 pulls. That slight bit of indica genetics makes this a very mellow high as well as being euphoric and talkative. Great for daytime, I'd smoke this every day if I could. Goes perfectly with any instrument!”"
Gtree50,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-power/reviews/1395471,"“I smoked this just now before going to the grocery store and I was very talkative, happy, and hungry 😁 I may have reeked as well”"

I found a grape and sugar feno. very strong and overwelming high. 
Note: for novates anxiety could go up, be caution.”"
catanibis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-power/reviews/1351604,"“This has quickly become one of my favorite strains. It definitely is a very happy high and it gets my creative process flowing rapidly. If you like your buds sour, you need this in you stock.”"

This has a great relaxing clear high that's great for catching up on your favourite tv shows or just having a nice relaxing evening without a crazy burnout. Also a wonderful complement to mix up with other strains.”"
ChemicalGeorge,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-power/reviews/1643862,"“Alright, let me start off with how the bud looks. The buds were big, beautiful and simply AMAZING. The buds were pointy, it had a pale, yet strong green color. There were some purple hairs on it which made it look that much more amazing. Now the was a ass load of crystals on this bud. It looked like someone got pinch fulls of powdered sugar and put it on this thing. I know this Strain was going to be amazing when I w...”"

OGCrash,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-power/reviews/1355985,"“I enjoyed this strain very much.  I wanted to try it for the focus aspect of it.  The high levels of THC though, made it impossible to actually work.  Still not the one I'm looking for in terms of being able to work without being too far gone.  But it's a good head high that comes on fast and doesn't fade.

My new favorite Sativa.”"

I realized I didn't have to take as big of hits while smoking this bud...it's smooth and hits you quickly. I instantly became uplifted and chatty. Sour Power has easily made it into my top 5 strains!”"

The head and body highs are both quite enjoyable, and when I smoke enough, I feel very creative and happy. I also catch myself laughing a lot. I'm on it right now, which urged me to write this review. It's also helping me GREATLY with my cramps that were tearing me apart this morning.”"

waykup,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-power/reviews/1585900,"“I put this more in the Indica side of a hybrid or a 50/50 balance based on the phenotype I experienced. Classic cannabis taste thats sour and little skunky with smooth herbal and berry undertones. Mellow high. It can be blended with anything when dabbing which is I think the Indica / Sativa ratio is balanced. It works well for ADD/ADHD but needs more Sativa to be a full time medicine. Works well for stress and anxiet...”"
BowlStraka,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-power/reviews/1508277,"“Mine smells like sour acrid berries.  I made edibles with it to really get to know it well.  It’s uplifting but not racy and it definitely had me lmao at stupid sh*t earlier.  It’s trippy and cerebral and very much a head high.  For me it calmed my anxiety and I just feel content.”"
