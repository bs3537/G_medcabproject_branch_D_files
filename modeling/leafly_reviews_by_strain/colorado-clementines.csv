Excellent citrus/orange flavour, blankets of euphoria rush over in waves, such a lovely strain to wind the day down, carry away all your Troubles, cares and woes stream away.. I'd recommend this indica to any indica lover or Cannabis enthusiasts and cannaseurs alike!!!!”"

This strains' fluffy dank buds smell of the best kind of oranges. Like it's intoxicating to smell it. There is a Utopia, and it's in this tasty bud. Its some of the dopest dope I ever smoked. Tastes like biting into a nice loud orangey citrus. Much love Colorado.”"

First of all I’m not a heavy user and i’ve been enjoying herb since the 1970’s. So when I go back to smoking after a brief or long hiatus, I’m riding a cloud depending on how good the strain is. So after waiting for about a month to renew my medical card, I wanted to give Colorado Clementine a try after reading the glowing reviews.

No disappointment here.

It is a delivery service. Leafly says that it isn't available in the Detroit area, but I just got some this morning. Not bad! Don't plan on doing anything cause it makes you real chill. I will be getting again. This is on my top 3. I have a new top 3 list now. Lol.”"

arulius,https://www.leafly.com/indica/colorado-clementines/reviews/1551185,"“it's a nice relaxing blend. I really like the citrusy flavor.

I think this particular strain is one that you need to not pay much attention to the THC level I mean if it's under 19 or something then I would be concerned that it says I can go up to 23 but at 19 it's got a nice little high to it

It's in Albuquerque New Mexico I just picked up some on a Saturday Sunday special for $7 a gram. it was how to dispensary c...”"
