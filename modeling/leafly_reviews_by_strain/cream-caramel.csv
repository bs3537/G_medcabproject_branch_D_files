Los cogollos son firmes y compactos, de un verde intenso y cubiertos de resina, que brilla y tiene tonos marrones, azucarados -entiendo que por el grado de maduración en que fueron cosechados.

El olor no es muy intenso. Es agradable, con tonos cítricos y dulces. No encu...”"

Fantastic smell, taste appearance and indica effect. I am in love with this strain. 

Really smooth and tasty on the intake, but when you let go it reminds you how powerful it is!

I got a packet of seeds from Cannabis and Seeds, grew em and was absolutely floored. I got a huge yield. The flavor is mild and creamy. It sort of coats your mouth, but in a nice way.
