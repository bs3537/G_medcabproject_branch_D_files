inanothercastle,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1384903,"“Pungent berry smell, reminds me a bit of wine or kombucha. 

Tastes sweet. Mostly it doesn't make you cough at all, but occasionally it'll catch you and you'll cough pretty aggressively. 

A very alert, tingly high. Perfect for doing things around the house or playing video games.”"
DaBinx,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1379547,"“The name says it all. Got a gram from "Top Shelf"  in washington from issaquah rec shop. Took a ride across the cascades and lost my train of thought mid sentence. Shortly there after i found myself following a mcdonalds semi truck zoning out on the french fries. Once i hit civilization food was first on the list followed by more purple champagne. Rinse and repeat. Lowers your IQ significantly for about an hour.”"
DHardyJr75,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1373144,"“This is a very solid Sativa, gives out an abundant amount of focus, alertness and energy while also appealing to the likes of an indica that provides that heavy high...real solid strain”"

Shaunkush01,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1274041,"“absolutely one of my favorite strains. one blunt and youll be feeling great. the effects dont last too long, maybe 1-1:30. youll want to take a hike after smoking this. also noticed it puts me in these trances, where i just start thinking hardcore.”"
dougiee18,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1375163,"“very good high, pretty flower, smell is very potent though. smoked half a blunt by myself and put it out and waited for the effects to set in. i would say i'm happy i put it out when i did though because i'm very high while typing this, would recommend 10/10”"
dawkinfreak20,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1280258,"“Good strain, very good high. Only downside is the dry mouth, but all in all would recommend.”"
flipsticle,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1397351,"“This is a HYBRID!

After popping 40 of these seeds, the ones I like the best are the most Indica pheno types. 

I am going to spread it around like crazy, and to call this a sativa is pretty misleading.  

How do I get this changed to hybrid?”"
Jaylien,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1370427,"“This stuff is awesome, berry/fruity smell and flavor, tastes great out of a vape,   Really uplifting happy high, no paranoia anxiety, or any negatives whatsoever.  This is a favorite of mine for sure.  Good for day use, won't put you to sleep, can talk and socialize, do activities without feeling sloppy.”"
Swede,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1264762,"“This is my first sativa I've tried and i do like it!! It help with my energy but not so much with the pain. I was surprised by the body and head feeling you get, but this is a good daytime strain and not to over powering.”"
GottaJibbooToo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1245705,"“marketed as indica/hybrid I expected a more sedated feeling. I was happy to find my anxiety and anger from my bad day melted away and I still had energy to tackle my chores.”"
gatorhunts420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1330529,"“The grower didn't want to test this product in a medical state! Why! And WTF! With patience I finally convinced him to do the right thing and with samples in hand I grabbed an 1/8th because of the genetics! Very tasty gdp in the flavor of this hybrid. If the effects are sativa well I shouldn't have hit the blue mystic after lol. I can't tell cause I'm really high! Super sweet and dank covered in tricomes. Dense stick...”"
insanemoe,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1450333,"“One of the best strains I've tried so far.
The smell is deep strong but sweet and piney/hearty.
Very uplifting and makes you wanna run or train.
I feel hyper creative, giggly, smile alot and still alert of everything around me without the bad paranoia.”"

Fullyman1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1387989,"“euphoric, sweet sativa goodness! this is an awesome sativa will get you up moving. only thing is it has very stoney feeling at same time so not very clear headed,hence 4 stars. I like it though for doing simple shit, good body feeling too. taste an smell a+!”"

mtchyg,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1258015,"“Upon further review, this is a great day time strain. Very functional and mostly clear headed. Vaped at 365 gives very little heavy stoned feel and more of an uplifted vibe. Really nice strain”"
DeejSeen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1307856,"“This strain has very very sweet aroma, and that honestly is the bulk of the smell. I sense some notes of grape, and a bit of earthyness, but it's just very smelling, and it was very very strong, but about middle ground on pain relief.”"
Kirrion,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1735182,"“Wow. The flavor, and medicinal quality is utterly amazing. The taste....musky, sweet, grape, tart. Fantastic for pain, muscle aches, migraines. It sort of feels like.....grandaddy purple for the daytime. Relaxing and dreamy, beautiful flowers. I would agree with some of the other reviews that this strain feels closer to a 50/50 hybrid than a sativa dominant hybrid (which is fantastic to me!). Love the flavor and the ...”"

theonehundredman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-champagne/reviews/1592700,"“The aftertaste alone is amazing and very strong and tasty. Like you've been drinking champagne while eating grape gum. This one is a touch stoney, and does start like an Indica, before gradually moving to a semi-Sativa effect. Good vibe; you can feel the Granddaddy Purple genetics here.  A pretty smiley one that's a creeper. Purple Champagne is perhaps better classified as a sativa-type hybrid, instead of just sativa...”"

The name says it all for smell and taste and I feel some pressure in my head that many sativas are known for creating.  Leafly calls this a sativa, though the Buddies box labels it a hybrid.  It's a cross between Grandaddy Purpl...”"

As soon as i inhaled the smoke i could feel the effects already sprouting out. I now feel this sativa heavily behind my eyes. Its a pleasant and relaxing feeling, that hasn't taken me away from the things i have to get done.

8/10- First thoughts
*Note i was hungry before smoking.”"

17% THC Sativa
Flower: nice tight little asparagus spear shaped buds with purple leaves amongst the orange hairs. Smells like fresh squeezed lemonade/citrus champagne. I wanna sleep in the bag. Intoxicating. 
Crumble: grinds up like I expect top shelf farms product to. Fluffy and seems to increase in size when ground. Very frosty. 
Burn: clean and ev...”"

Not too stoned feeling, and more relaxed and happy. Easy to smoke and easy to smoke all day long.

It's light and effervescent, just like the name suggests. It's a pretty one and one of my all time favorites.”"
