olman420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-heron/reviews/1335502,"“This bud smells like a cabin in a pine Forrest.no kidding. the buds are very very compact and dense high calyx to leaf for sure. The high is very nice and more or less up in nature but not overwhelming as some sativa dominant strains can be.
I give Blue Heron 5 out of 5 stars”"
