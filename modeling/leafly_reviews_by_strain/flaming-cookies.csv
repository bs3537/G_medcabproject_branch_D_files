However, I found it to be racey like a sativa. My heart was beating and I was shakey as well as quick moving. Definitely a cerebral fog, though. My body was slightly tingly. Mind unable to focus on anything or really move the body to do anything. Very strange, as the feel is both extremely energetic ye...”"

IBeLounging,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flaming-cookies/reviews/1646690,"“Bearing a slightly different name (Fire Cookies), this potent bud by Natural Fx hits hard. 25.9% THC and 0% CBD combine for a great high. Personally, I find this a great bud to take to the gym and pound out reps. 
It carries a nice, earthy smell without the skunkiness one would expect. Make sure to have plenty of water on hand. This one will make you thirstier than the orchid I keep forgetting to water. Oh, son of a ...”"

Quantaray,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flaming-cookies/reviews/1277974,"“Grown to its potential Flaming Cookies offers a powerful indica dominant high, with THC in the low 20% range.  It is a little more energetic than a 100% indica strain, but overall it is going to slow you down a step.

The smell is mainly earthy and spicy as you would expect from its OG Kush lineage.   

Nuggets are dense and on the smaller side, but they break up with that nice, resinous snap that tells you it's well...”"

Ariaslight,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flaming-cookies/reviews/1372903,"“great for giving that nice relaxed feeling after a hard day and lifting spirits”"
jakeprnhs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/flaming-cookies/reviews/1541175,"“So what I smoked was called fire scouts. I believe it's the same strain as it has the same parents, but just a different name. I found this strain to be very balanced. You get the uplifting head high from a sativa but on tue back end the relaxation and pain relief from an indica. If your looking for a strain with an equal amount of sativa and indica effects this is what you want.”"
