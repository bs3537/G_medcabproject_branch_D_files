Moonbeam
=============
IndustrialTreeHugger,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1732298,"“Such a pleasant, clean taste of earth, flowers, and fruit.  The initial feeling of clear headedness and pleasant emotions took immediate effect.  Even the bad things in life seem like "happy mistakes" right now.  

Just somewhat pleasant and mellow... if Bob Ross were to invent a weed strain, this would be it.”"
1040krissy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1732559,"“a very relaxing and happy high.”"
ScreamingBarnacle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1740329,"“Not a fan. My focus was through the roof, but the stress relief was similar to an actual antidepressant. Not down for just feeling Numb and angry at the same time. My libido is nonexistent. Hubby had similar complaints. We're going to pass on this one next time.”"
Kmn.,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1747293,"“I bought this on the government site and to be honest, I wasn’t at all expecting this indica to be this workable. Normally with indica I’m knocked out but this one gave me a relaxed and calm feeling and actually perked me up. Flavour is great on this one. Now if only OCS will restock 😩”"
Mandiwhymark,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1733259,"“Super flavourful great high, just a little harsh on the throat.”"

Funkwell77,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1737404,"“This is a great after work strain for me, after 12 hours on my feet moonbeam takes a lot of my pain away and then I go to sleep happy. I got 3.5 from the Tweed store here in Nl and it actually over weighed by a bit. Very happy paying $45.”"

Ratattack,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1806781,"“I took this strain from the Sqdc at 22% thc, the buds looks horrible.. but the high is perfect!! just like the other guy comment, smiling for like 1hr and being calm at the same time, i was still really creative even if the effects were fading. Get that strain if you can!!!”"
CowieBud,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1762523,"“The effect is definitely on point for a strong indica. I love the fruity earthy tones. The aroma reminds me of an applecore. I'm not impressed with the appearance of the.9”"

Chainbrain,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1747018,"“This strain is awesome. It gives a nice relaxing finish to a stressful long day. You dont want to do much but worry not, for once the high wears off there is no burn out. Leaves a relaxed, refreshed feeling.”"
Mattpat421,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1747068,"“This was by far some of the best tasting smoke. Great buzz.. nice permanent grin”"
Tri_chome,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1737999,"“The perfect earthy to sweet ratio. Beautiful zen like high. Definitely will buy again”"
McWiggles89,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1739349,"“One of the best tasting buds I have had. Nice deep earthy almost chocolate taste. You get lost in your own thoughts with this bud but be warned it will burn you out HARD. This review was based off 17% THC Bud , just picked up 27% THC Moonbeam today.”"
Wardtopia,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1748422,"“Ordered mine from OCS, the company was Leafs by snoop. The buds were loose and moldy. Literally unsmokable. I tried in a bong but still had an overwhelming mold taste. Very disappointed. Would not recommend and I will never order this strain or from Lear’s by snoop again.”"
C_train,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1752096,"“I find moonbeam is mellow long enough to watch a 22 min sitcom. Then the thoughts that need to be spoken escape and you’re yelling because every idea is more important than the last. I’m extremely eloquent on moonbeam. I just need to learn to go to bed before the 1.5-2 hour mark, because that’s when the sleepies AND the munchies kick in and I end up dipping an entire chocolate bar into a jar of peanut butter.”"
OviGreen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1766479,"“Best strain I've had in years. Took about 5 puffs off the vape, and it left me deep in thought for the next 30 minutes. You could say it blasted me to the moon. 

Quite euphoric for an indica, yet it very much remains an indica with its couch locking quality and deeply relaxing tingles to the body. 

It also gave me some severe munchies, so I'd recommend you have the food ready or on its way before consuming since yo...”"
camii420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/moonbeam/reviews/1805377,"“I like the high but the taste of earth is really strong. 
I usually like sweet or fruty weeds but moonbeam was really good too.”"
