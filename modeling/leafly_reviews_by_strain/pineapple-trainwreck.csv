I'm an experienced smoker with severe arthritis, and this strain knocked me into an ocean and left me stranded there without a life vest. The onset takes a little bit for sure. You start to feel very giggly and happy, and then you get smacked in the face with a tsunami of highness. My body was floating in nothingness, and all my pain disappeared completely. You do ge...”"

Copped some of this from a local dispensary and smoked it in a hemp wrap they provided for free ninety-nine. Taste was...eh! But the high was top shelf. It's nice when you smoke with a group of people and everyone has this realization that we just smoked good bud. Concerning the effects, It's a nice cerebral buzz, but I felt mellow and clearheaded.

freedom45,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-trainwreck/reviews/1415411,"“Oddly enough I Love Love Trainwreck. Which is odd because I do not really care for Pineapple Express.  Trainwreck is a great medication for migraines and stress or anxiety. Great body buzz, great head buzz as it shuts everything off. Allowing your body to pump more blood to the brain therefore freeing you from headaches or migraines. Works best when only smoked for a few weeks then rotating with two or three others.”"
