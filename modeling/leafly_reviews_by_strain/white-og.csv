ari3991,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-og/reviews/1397286,"“If you find this strain, buy it because you just struck gold (or white in this case). This strain is not for light weights. It'll chew you up and spit you out unless you manage to avoid passing out from how very relaxed and medicated you'll be. If you do manage to stay awake, I can guarantee you that you will be soaring throughout the deepest areas of your mind. Therapy in the shape of fluffy, STICKY, crystallized nu...”"

Peaceful, definitely euphoric, happiness and moderately uplifting, this strain is the bees knees. Now, having had hundreds of strains, and having an experienced pallet, knowing what it is I'm looking for, this is one of them. I'd attempt to put it into my all-time favorites list, however, I just don't know where or what number it'd ...”"

GreenPie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-og/reviews/1355269,"“First experiences: Vaped it. Great taste/smell. Effects take a little while to kick in. I find myself stupefied to the point I can't do anything other than lie down. Yet I can't sleep either, which I was banking on. I try to watch something but find everything tiresome as my body is couch-locked and my mind feels paralyzed/apathetic. Meh!

Later experiences: Kills pain. A solid heavy indica that has high THC content....”"

In short, this is what Indica should be.  You have control.  You can function if you want, or you can veg if you want, but if you cross the line and smoke too much, the indica will have its way with you, haha.  I would go so far as to say that if you ...”"
