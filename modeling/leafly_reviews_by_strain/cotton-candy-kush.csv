Sweet and flowery smoke, buds that smell almost like candy, and a delicate balance between a mellowed out body and a stimulated happy mind. The buds are crisp and with perfect density, the nugs smoke beautifully; It's almost as if the weed wants to smoke itself...

Smoked, it tends to taste strong and harshly of chlorophyll but the aroma is heavy with lavender and berry. Vaped it smells predominantly of lavender and taste-wise, all that chlorophyll takes on a minty tone that is actually rather soothing, even cooling.
