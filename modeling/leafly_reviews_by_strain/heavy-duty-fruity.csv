Heavy Duty
=============
Kellogg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1353519,"“It's pretty, my hubby and I also call it "redhead reefer" because of the thick red hairs it has.  Lots of keef to be collected, if you have a grinder with a keef collector.  Smells great, wonderfully clear high.  Top notch!”"
DabbinMiss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1343295,"“Focused and alert high. Great day time med for anxiety/depression. Strong fruity taste, my be considered sweet by some users. Small dabs of this throughout the day is how I keep medicated. Highly recommended!!”"
bigdipper22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1065037,"“This is one of my favorites. If grown correctly it is a nice even high with a smooth finish. The flavor is phenomenal especially if you enjoy a fruity finish. I've done plenty of housework after a couple of hits of this strain. I've mostly smoked this strain that I grew but have tried it at dispensaries a couple of times. If you just want to have fun try Heavy Duty Fruity.”"
hieseherr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1385033,"“Heavy duty fruity is a stain that yields incredible high.  May very well be one of the highest yielding.  I didn't rate this strain as medicinal because of the lack of effect other that anxiety.  One 2 gram joint smoked halfway produced a buzzy spacey high that was somewhat pleasurable, but more psychedelic than I would have liked.  Probably would be good for someone suffering from a mental disorder, but no good for ...”"

littlemissuniverse,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1590959,"“This strain is the best. You become very focused and relaxed at the same time. And most of all, my favorite part on this strain is that it gives you the LSD feeling. You smoke it and you get high and you’d feel like you’re on some acid euphoria. Also it’s best to have sex on this and to listen to chill mixes with beats and bass and a lot of instruments. It’s like giving you a super power of hearing cause you’ll hear ...”"

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1065016,"“Nice taste good yield. Effects are gone in about an hour. Good smoke before you go into movies medicine you will be comfortable and might even remember the end the movie enjoy.”"
BigBadBob,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1226485,"“Wow!!! Just WOW!!! Mindblowing psychic storm, lightly psychedelic, but with super heavy indica influenced body effects. Don't plan an evening out while enjoying this one. I love it!!!”"
sdsmith0889,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1065014,"“This bud did not have a strong smell to it. The high was quite powerful in the way it made me feel introverted and allowed my mind to wander to many profound thoughts. As the name would imply this strain tasted fruity but also slightly spicy. Very little negative effects, a little dry mouth and thats it.”"
steveishigh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1391991,"“HeavyDutyFruity has always been my favorite strain.  It has an excellent smell that says "I can't wait to be vaporized", sweet fruity flavor and the best overall high I have come across in 40 years.”"
hughes1304,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1065013,"“"HDF is 50% Sativa 50% Indica. The heritage is Killin Garberville x Mendocino Hash Plant x Seattle Big Bud."

Good smoke, I could definitely notice the "muscle soothing" capabilities of the strain. Left me with a nice euphoria quickly but could bring anxiety and/or laziness if used too much.”"
SailorBruh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1254247,"“seriously the f-ing best smoke I've ever had.... helps my insomnia and makes me super creative !”"
Paullyrj21,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1065036,"“Smells really good.  It's a sweet smell, not fruity like fruit punch, but more like oranges.  

When you grind it for vaping it definitely intensifies the aroma. 

Buds are pale green with tons of red and orange hairs and some decent crystallization.

I tool three pulls from my pax and a nice smooth happy buzz slowly creeped in.  It was a enjoyable high not overwhelming just euphoric and happy.  

No anxiety no paran...”"

The batch I had barley got me going, but i did feel a strange light body high. I ended up saving it for a night cap, before bed. Never picked it up again. it might be good, the grower who grew it, might have messed it up. Tasted good, but I need some KA-Pow too.”"

I was looking for Afgoo, because it really helps with my insomnia.   Not only did this help me with my insomnia, but it also help with stress and anxiety.  The only thing is that this strain, for me, goes straight into the next day as far as sleep.  I was still a little sleepy at around 2:30pm the next day.

Enock420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1280254,"“Perfectly Balanced Hybrid! Feels like a heavy indica with no real couch lock or lack of motivation because it also feels like a nice sativa. Best of both worlds. Mellows my anxiety down after a few minutes, works great for stress or irritation and puts me to sleep beautifully. Mine has a musky citrus smell to it. Taste is wonderful. Overall one of my all time favorite strains.”"

The look/taste is 10/10 but effects are what i care about most and i must say it felt like a mild indica with no couch lock effects and a mild sativa with no real strong cerebral effect so i feal by being a hybrid this strain gives you a little of each which is good but it doesnt deliver those effects as strong as i thought it would have.

brinamarcy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/heavy-duty-fruity/reviews/1263436,"“This is a nice strain. It indeed calls out your creative side, and your hunger side! It tastes like Fruity Pebbles. I wish it had couch lock though and less cotton mouth. Overall a good smoke.”"
