I loved this strain.”"
Michael1977,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mint-chocolate-chip/reviews/1537982,"“I really liked it a lot. It gave me a tingly buzzy feeling in my legs and feet. My hands also. I highly recommend listening to Ricky Martin's "Living La Vida Loca" while smoking or dabbing this strain. I promise you with 100% certainty that you will enjoy.”"

It defiantly has a minty taste and is very smooth.. Buds on this strange hybrid are super dense and very resinous... Packed with crystals MCC starts off a tingly sensation with a nice dose of euphoria.. Really smooth inhale love the dark minty chocolate taste on the exhale.. And if you use a heavy dose  MCC will leave y...”"

maasai2015,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mint-chocolate-chip/reviews/1479601,"“I don't think the name is necessarily referring to the flavor profile of the herb itself but more the velvety ice cream feel in your mouth you get from smoking this buttah hybrid. Yeah, I likes.”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mint-chocolate-chip/reviews/1767335,"“I’m partial to mint chocolate chip. Keify beige and green tight nugs with small moderate brown hairs smells like sweet mint, sage, and chocolate. I did enjoy the euphoric relaxation heavy body buzz. I didn’t enjoy the anxiety accompanying it. A bit to speed ball like to me. Flavor is great though. Effects are just to bitter. I don’t care to get again.”"

He orders a beer sits down holding his rabbit upright in his lap. You immediately get the felling this guy is strange. The more he talks you know he's a weirdo and that creepy felling crawls from the bottom of your spine up to your neck. (Women you know what I'm talking about)  This is the time to sprint back to ...”"

Skyhigh01,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mint-chocolate-chip/reviews/1807243,"“Excellent strain. super strong and completely covered in thc. Looking for a strain to knock you out and go to bed this is the one. Most thc I have seen on a bud in quite a bit, there was honestly so much I was covered in it, piles of crystals on each bud with great bright purple all over excellent strain highly recommended!!”"

Chunkdawg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mint-chocolate-chip/reviews/1751718,"“WOAH. These buds have more crystals than a damn cave. Amazing presence and a true minty chocolate chip cookie smell. The high leaves you relaxed, talkative, and energetic. Minor anxiety swells and paranoia, but a very cerebral high. Felt like I can talk to anyone, but had me stuck inside of my own head as well. Highly recommend if you want to collect kief from these pristine buds as well.”"

jimenamorgade,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mint-chocolate-chip/reviews/1787805,"“1. Al abrir el contenedor, el strain liberó un olor penetrante, pude sentir como entraba por mi nariz y al instante me hizo soltar un grito que contenía sorpresa y ganas de fumar al mismo tiempo. 

2. La textura de la flor tiene resina y puedes ver las gotas cristalinas a contra luz.

3. El efecto fue rápido con solo dos caladas ya estaba bastante puesta como para ponerme a hacer chistes estúpidos con mi mascota.
