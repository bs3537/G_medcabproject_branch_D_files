CannabisExpert,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-siberian/reviews/1464915,"“Have been smoking for the past thirty years. WhitebSiberian is one of those strains you know is awesome by just looking at the prime quality buds. After years of smoking, you become an expert by just looking at the bud.

Pros: Pain relief that kicks in fairly quickly. Relaxing body calm feeling, same feeling in the mind/head.

Cons: No real major cons imo, however taste is interesting as it had a hint of spice on draw and exhale, yet earthy and what I thought was a light pine taste, however the description of flowery taste is more apt.

Overall: Good for pain and relaxation without sleepines...”"

I also found this to be arousing and perfect for sex. IF I am physically tired...after say 2-3 sessions with this I become sleepy. However when I am not physically tired in the first place...that tiredness can take much longer to show up.  And the "tiredness" thing tends to show up after a while for me with mul...”"

Esclavamente,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-siberian/reviews/1783533,"“I asked my budtender to recommend a daytime-use strain for a mixed group of people. If I'm sharing with coworkers on a mid-day break, it is best to bring a strain with energetic and uplifting effects, but the work is also hard on the body, so I wanted to find a strain that would lower inflammation.
