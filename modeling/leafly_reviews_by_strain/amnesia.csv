The smell is easy to recognise, which a sour, pungent smell. Sometimes the taste is a bit too sour but overall decent taste.

Took some on a long day hike and had lots of energy. This strain has one of the clearest highs I've ever known. It takes the pain away but keeps the mind focused on things like conversation and looking at pretty flowers. What I did observe is that I never felt that cerebral takeover- the zoning out and forgetting what I was thinking a...”"

Then.... relax. Enjoy the moment of being a potato. In a fucking good way of being a potato. I Love that weed, but  only for the end of the day. (Outdoor)”"
ChillPill,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/amnesia/reviews/1416864,"“An uplifting Sativa (like most); it doesn't make you as sleepy and couch-locked as an Indica that is. It's great for stress and even pain (which is awesome!). It does help kick the depressive state I get into sometimes, as well. It has a very pungent smell but tastes earthy, almost like you're smoking a "regular" plant leaf or flower. As a Sativa lover, I recommend this strain to anyone who thinks it may help them.

This thing has character. Effects are similar but less intense than sour diesel. Intense cerebral effects are there, colors get better and depth of field increases if you are outdoors. It could be classified as the Level - 1 of the psychedelic experiences accor...”"
