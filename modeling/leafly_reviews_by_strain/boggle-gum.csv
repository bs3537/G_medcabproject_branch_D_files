Binkyfarms,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boggle-gum/reviews/1367836,"“BoggleGum? The name cracks me up. In all fairness, it's a great strain. I picked some up in San Jose and was stoked because it was Clean Green certified. Bonus! The effect is a great balance between head and body. Your body slows down and your mind become free. Good stuff.”"

As soon as I cracked the puck half the room smelled, The smell itself is very hard to pinpoint. Slightly citrusy yet also somewhat cheesy with subtle undertones of Kush. The high itself was VERY creative. Going to be my new go to strain if I ever need to write. Overall I give this strain a 4.5/5”"

For heavy smokers like myself its not my all time favorite because its easy to get used to its effects and the "peak" high you can receive in my opinion although it is a wonderful high is meh.  This stuff does wonders for anxiety tho for a sativa heavy strain.  I recommend this strain for sure.”"

echo455,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boggle-gum/reviews/1063773,"“Sweet smelling, gum-like taste. Mellow high with a lot of focus. Must be high in CBD? Not overpowering and lasts about 2-3 hours.”"
casida,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boggle-gum/reviews/1063759,"“By and far, this is my favorite strain that I've found so far.  It is an Indica-heavy hybrid combination of BOGBubble and Northern Lights #5.  I can't even begin to explain the feeling, but each time I use it it seems to be better than the previous.  I only regret that it's difficult to find.  I found it at Elemental Wellness, but I purchased only 1g.  When I went back, they had sold out of the WHOLE batch, and were ...”"

torysue,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boggle-gum/reviews/1293355,"“Loved this smooth happy euphoric feelings. Great sensory boost to sight, sounds and touch.  You can get through a whole day with energy to do stuff, no hard crash at the end just a light fading out of being high. And no headaches :)”"

Update - Really difficult to locate strain”"

ttricha,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boggle-gum/reviews/1063760,"“Pretty nice stuff, bought an eighth after smoking it with a buddy. Has a really mellow flavor, with an almost citrus-taste. The effects were instant, rushed right to my head and spun it like a top. Also had a nice body high to accompany it. One downside, however, was  how fast I built up tolerance to it, faster than anything else I've smoked, but overall, a great strain.”"
spicycolleen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/boggle-gum/reviews/1191716,"“Leaves me really calm, content but inspired, and I definitely notice some pain management. Makes me SUPER sleepy.  Not my favorite tasting bud but definitely one I'll get again.”"
