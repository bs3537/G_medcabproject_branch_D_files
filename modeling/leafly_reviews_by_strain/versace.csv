APeaceofPie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/versace/reviews/1412900,"“Brandon0571 speaks nothing but the truth; "It's a truly magical strain". This strain is sweet but thick and robust. It sets in with a clear head high that'll make everyone smile and eases into a mellow, balanced body high. This would definitely be a great strain if you were generally feeling down. The only "negatives" I'd give this strain would be a slight headache and maybe dry mouth but my eyes were never too terri...”"

    The buds wore a faded green shade, with bold orange hairs shining brightly underneath a light coat of  trichomes. These buds had all the physical features of a luxurious strain, aptly named after the high profiled fashion...”"
gorebag,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/versace/reviews/1412901,"“A unique trait of this strain is that it does not inhibit your mind much even after several hits, comparable to Super Jack. It gives a very comforting euphoria that's stronger than some other sativas I have tried. Tastes very good, too. 

Definitely worth trying if you want a productive euphoria with zero paranoia.”"
BlackAdam52,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/versace/reviews/1587486,"“Just vaped a bowl of Versace in a dry herb vape. Any anxiety and depression that I had before my session was replaced with a good cerebral high. Soon after I felt it spread through my body.  I'm relaxed, but I feel that I could still go out if I needed to. This strain is up there with GSC as a strain that makes me feel like me.”"
Butch420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/versace/reviews/1484297,"“Love this strain! Had it for the first time a few days ago and I was stoned for hours. very mellow and euphoric high. I didn't really get sleepy or have the herb slump. overall, this is a TOP SHELF STRAIN!”"
myopically1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/versace/reviews/1533790,"“if you like a heavy cerebral sour high and og with a touch of couch lock, this interesting strain is strong and good for daytime use. due to its indica roots, i personally have drifted off with music or something to focus on. it's worth a try, but it was more expensive than usual and there are many strains before this i'd keep in my dish.”"
Sudds04201978,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/versace/reviews/1752228,"“Great strain! When it comes around to me, it goes fast because of it’s clean high and ability to remain focused. It’s got a pretty good following from most of my “patients with lower back pain, arthritis and knee pain. Even though it’s not a huge pain relief, it keeps the mind clear and lowers the chances for depression and raises appetite levels. Great breed all in all.”"

Eduardough,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/versace/reviews/1469267,"“Before smoking I was watching Netflix, it made me want to listening to music and play some xbox, and it didnt make me do hella bad, so you’ll be able to control those Indica effect whenever you have to. Even with a really steady sativa feel, you can still relax, and with a manageable dry mouth, plus the munchies aren’t that bad. Anyways, after playing a long game I ended the high with listening to music and relaxing....”"
kengotthevisionn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/versace/reviews/1521019,"“This isn't a strain that creeps up on you, it's more of a calming & refreshing body high that only slightly distracts you from life. Good tasting buds that stick to your fingers while rolling, packing, or whatever you do. Sativa dominant but I probably wouldn't advise you to expect yourself to be a functional human being after smoking this.”"
Doppleganggerx3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/versace/reviews/1574750,"“So I've been smoking since I was only young and I know this one definitely had my vote hands down . I took one large bong rip and I was in the clouds , immediately started talking out loud or maybe I thought I was . There is a God and Makes Versace .”"

The flavor is fruity and smooth plus it smells delicious.  The effects are great for me for day use.  I am cautious with sativas even sativa hybrids.  Versace medicates perfectly!!!”"
