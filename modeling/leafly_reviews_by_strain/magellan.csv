JazztobaccOG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/magellan/reviews/1558829,"“Truly fantastic new strain! Absolutely soaring, long lasting  physical and mental euphoria with this one. Diesely skunk on the inhale with a lingering pink fruit flavor. The product of many years of breeding, I expect this unique strain to stick around for a while.”"
hsiric,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/magellan/reviews/1563897,"“I just got this strain and am about 15 minutes into it. I’d say 10/10 makes you talkative and euphoric.

Very energetic and upbeat at first..a bit too extreme in high amounts. It made me a bit jittery and anxious. Take this one slow and you’ll enjoy it more. Not in my top 10, but worth checking out!”"

This sativa-dominant hybrid is complex in every way, starting with the aroma (strawberry, wood and pine, maybe with some pastry going on as well?) and the taste (strawberry, sour berries, sandalwood and hops).

As I usually do with sativa-leaning strains, I tried it out in my one-hitter to gauge whether it would trigger any anxiety. Nothing but good vibes and, holy hell, it was strong. I usua...”"
