It is like the first time you become medicated. I noticed I had a lot of anxiety and a lot of stress going to a party so I brought my cannabis and medicated before going in and had a good time, not one of the best but a great time. If you have stress anxiety, mood disorders or even a severe amount of pain and nerve...”"

Indicaem,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-47/reviews/1304928,"“This strain is hybrid dominant with a sweet and skunky smell and an undertone of honey.  This is the type of bud that is perfect for relaxing on the beach for the day. It made me happy and relaxed, without a care in the world.   This helped me regulate my moods but it didnt quite slow my mind down as much as I would hope for.”"

Rioga,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-47/reviews/1271332,"“Have been getting this in spain for a few weeks now.  Excellent product! Great high.  Body rocked with indica,  mind on point with sativa.  Definitely recommend.”"
sensimedihigrade,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-47/reviews/1737797,"“This was the first strain I ever grew, small closet with cfl above and  on sides, about 200w to 2x1ft space with two small plants. 
I obviously didn't pull a whole lot, but what I did pull lasted me quite some time. 
This strain is unbelievable, the taste and smell alone are something to be experienced. And in this case, that rings true for it's potency as well. 
Very balanced effects, leaning to sativa on the front ...”"
MBrandt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-47/reviews/1215908,"“I enjoyed the mild taste.  The effect was very relaxing, but not so much that I couldn't accomplish what ever I wanted to do.  I'm enjoying the mellowness right now.”"
