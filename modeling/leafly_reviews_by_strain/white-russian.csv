StukaFox,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-russian/reviews/1417459,"“When I was a mere lad, my father warned me of the dangers of marijuana. He told me, "If I catch you stealing any of MY pot, I'll kick your scrawny little ass!" My father was an angry drunk with Vietnam flashbacks. He could have used some White Russian. However, with Russian in the name, he would have thought it was some kind of Commie plot to steal his ditchweed. But he'd have been wrong: White Russian is a fluffy li...”"
