Green yeah but with hues of Blue, Purple, Silver

It doesn't get rid of all the pain, but nausea is taken care of and much of the pain is alleviated. Also great for PMS - not just the physical but mental/emotional too. Great bud with great look, smell, taste, and smoke.”"
Jrullman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blurple/reviews/1237906,"“Loved it!!! One the top 5 best tasting strains in my book -but i love the berry and sweetness!! This one is just great all around the high is level but very indica dominant in my case. Would highly recommend and I will be trying again🙂”"

Got ahold of a gram of some C02 produced beautiful, golden Blurple oil. 

The taste was 3.5/5, sweet, a little grapey.
The consistency was fairly stable, a little sappy and difficult to work with when too warm.

DEFINITELY a noteworthy strain though, and great for depression and anxiety.
If you have a ch...”"

Let me say Everytime it smells wonderful very pungent and Sweet. The buds are always big and beautiful. Now this could just be me but i will not use this particular strain.

There a small specks of purple on this bud covered like a chocolate chip cookie. It has a flowery berry taste that is smooth with a slight sting, not a real heavy smoke. was rated at 12.6% thc 50/50 hybrid. Coming off of durban poison, a sativa with 25% thc I was having my doubts to whether or not Blurple would be a good smoke. Overall it is a nice lo...”"

It wasn't that far off but I probably won't smoke this on purpose again. The high made me feel not very great and I ended up wanting to go to sleep because of a headache.”"

The high was also pretty awesome. My body felt good and relaxed while my head was all tingly. 👍🏼 However, not the best to smoke before bed.I felt wide awake.”"
