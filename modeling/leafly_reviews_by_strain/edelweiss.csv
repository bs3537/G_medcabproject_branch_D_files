Samurai_JAC,https://www.leafly.com/indica/edelweiss/reviews/1152061,"“-1st Degree BLACK BELT BUDS- Still as tasty and clear-headed as ever. I really enjoy this smoke when I need to wat5ch my children. It keeps my head totally clear while also enabling me to pick up my kids w/o ANY back pain whatsoever. This weed really helps me get through the day without feeling out of it or feeling l,ike just sitting on the couch and not moving. If your looking for that then look for a Indica maybe. ...”"
sarahthaguru420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/edelweiss/reviews/1145649,"“I smoked this strain a couple of times now and it get's better everytime. This last smoke was really cool, I actually made  a psychedelic drawing in a couple of hours. After that I smoked another joint with Edelweiss in it and I made another drawing in the same style, with the same passion. Great smoke, uplifting feeling and it makes you really chill.

Enclosed a picture I've drawn when smoking Edelweiss.”"

I must have smoked at least 200 grams in the past two months and have never felt better, both physically and mentally. If you're looking for a strain to get your day started without ("Mental") pain, anxiety or general social awkwardness, or if you're looking for a strain to go outside and smoke in the park with your friends and perhaps even pla...”"

Stoned in the sense of feeling like a real stone like a rock. Very clear in the head . I would do this strain while sitting on my cough and taking care of bussines. This one is will make you feel powerfull, energetic, clear and relaxed. The skunk kind of ruins  it though by giving it  a  bit of a trippy/spacy head vibe .  I rathe...”"

mabong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/edelweiss/reviews/1257237,"“I smoked this heavy hitter in Amsterdam in 2004. I can not recommend Edelweiss if you want to go out or be social.
This is best smoked to sink into the couch and feel your physique getting knocked out after 2-3 puffs.   
The Hindu Kush is strong in this.”"
