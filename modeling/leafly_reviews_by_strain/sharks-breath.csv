Then upon toke on this fantastic strain, I experienced a moderate "classic high" with a lot of deep relaxation similar to a really expensive ass shiatsu massage afterglow. Got a little thirsty but didn't want to move. Asked bae to bring up some water and got my hydrate on. Apologized to babygirl for calling her "son....”"

Shark breath is cool is like a lil explosion in the beginning but then it gets you mellow...You get that dry sensation in the eyes but is like if you were a little girl watching punnies and rainbow and bright grassland  but with a mellow sensation of hush stunned overwhelmed astonish shocked because of the bright grassland (not literally... Maybe) lol... is cool should try”"

These frosty, yellow/green buds have a sweet and sour earthy nose. Giving the buds a squeeze & sniff yields more pungent, candied fruit.

As you would expect from it's great parentage, the smoke is solidly potent with amazing taste and flavour. It burns clean and is ...”"

CrossM,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sharks-breath/reviews/1212758,"“First strain in over 3 years to actually work its magic on my particular symptoms. Alert, energetic, uplifted, and "ready to tackle the day" never described something so perfectly as this strain's affects. 

Highly recommended to combat veterans and others with PTSD. I feel happy for the first time in years after one bowl of this flower.”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sharks-breath/reviews/1276736,"“This strain shows the clear influence of its very opposite parents. There is a very nice relaxing body to this buzz but there's an even greater floaty and happy head high. I find it quite easy to be socially engaged and I'm also quite clear headed. I very much recommend Sharksbreath for almost any activity or time or day. A perfect balance and a great time.”"
Rabbithole,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sharks-breath/reviews/1073666,"“Very mellow, calm, laid back, great for watching a movie or tv. listening to music. I took it for sleep and it helped with sleep quite a bit. I would save this for evening. Also good for getting that "loving feeling".

This strain has very little smell and the smoke is pretty mild in flavor and smell. The high hits you right of the bat in head and body alike.”"
SirKush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sharks-breath/reviews/1073675,"“I have to say im quite impressed with this strain because i feel very happy and i can still think and still feel high and relieved and it helps me sleep a bit”"

beautys1tragedy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sharks-breath/reviews/1241423,"“This is a strain I hate to love. The smell is somewhat offsetting and sour and the flavor is very unique. I do like that it doesn't linger after smoking a bowl however and the high is fantastic!!! I felt happy and super relaxed. It's becoming my new favorite for ending a long day. The pros far outweigh my con's. 💚”"

This Sharksbreath is a pretty unique strain. After consumption you can note right away that the medicine is a indica dominant hybrid. relaxed, happy, uplifted, focused, and a heavy handed euphoric feeling.”"

I was feeling kind of lousy, and Sharksbreath made it so much better. I remain mentally and verbally articulate, gentle body high, kinda munchie. This stuff isn't flashy, so sometimes I'm a little bowled over by how wonderful it is. Definitely recommend.”"

The high got all of my creative juices flowing, energy up, and ended with just pure relaxation. I had cotton mouth for the first time in a while so be prepared.”"
cancancandisaurus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sharks-breath/reviews/1142892,"“This one is a very heavy set feeling, like you have a helmet strapped onto your head. The tingliness is nice and I could probably focus on that all night. It doesn't necessarily make me happy... More cloudy and relaxed. This strain however gives me congestion. It makes my nose run and makes me sneeze without fail- typically until the morning after.”"

MauiWowieGirl808,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sharks-breath/reviews/1308442,"“I got some top shelf of this and it was wonderful! Way more focused than I would have thought from an Indica mix. It was very cerebral and I felt like I could get a lot done, especially after 1 hit. I took a second at night and fell asleep. I have ADD and this was the first strain that actually made me focused. Also it is very relaxing and you hit cruising altitude right away. Its a very comfortable, mellow high that...”"

highkristen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sharks-breath/reviews/1300873,"“With out a doubt the best sativa I've tried. I am so productive and get so much done when I smoke this. And the best part is there's no anxiety!”"
GoddessOfRabbits,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sharks-breath/reviews/1570280,"“My experience with Sharksbreath was different than most of the reviews here. I was using a new vape pen and admittedly took too much of a first hit by accident. Yowzers! I never did THAT again!  Nausea, dizziness, nasty bile taste in my throat.  Ugh. I’ve been working on finding the right “dosage” to get the nice warm, tingly body high I liked without the knock-your-effing-socks-off zing about 5 minutes after the fir...”"

an immediate surge of lightness overcomes you with a peculiar europhia. focus is slightly impaired. but you can still focus on basic movies. munchies is not so high on this one.”"
