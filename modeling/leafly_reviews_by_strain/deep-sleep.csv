Deep Sleep
=============
IandI,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1386595,"“It didn't make me sleepy, but boy was I relaxed and euphoric, and totally loving my body sensations. Swirly loving vortex of goodness and lusty connections. Definitely will buy again. To me, this was the closest thing to ingesting a mellow tab of Ecstasy, but without the dancing and retardation.”"
bibiqiqi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1446522,"“Let me just preface this review by saying that I have steel-grade insomnia, and at my worst, I stayed up for five nights in a row because I was in such a bad sleep cycle. I've been prescribed a laundry list of sleep medications that either don't work or have really unpleasant side-effects. When I moved to California, I immediately got a medical card and started trying out different Indica strains for helping me sleep...”"
SativaMe3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1389839,"“I tried Deep Sleep OG from Natural Selections and it instantly became my favorite. If you love heavy indica strains, then this is for you. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️”"
brinamarcy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1383401,"“Love this strain. Perfect to go to sleep. Great for ptsd sufferers, this put me right to sleep with no nightmares. It lives up to its name.”"
JCartmell,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1415505,"“I've used many strains of Kush to promote sleep but often found them harsh on the lungs. Deep Sleep is a good sleep enhancer and smokes very smooth with no harshness or coughing. I'll be getting more of this in the future.”"
tbone16,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1375064,"“Picked up 3.5g of this at Kind Meds in Mesa... Wow, so good!  I asked for something to help with sleep and boy this stuff is amazing.  One of the best indicas for sleep I've tried.. It just knocks me out.  In about 10 minutes it changes me from a ball of anxiety to a gooey human shaped ball laying on its gummi back in bed.. Tired and smiling.  Not only does it help with sleeping, but it is awesome for general aches, ...”"
Syntality,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1374889,"“I use this for sleep mainly and of course handles my headaches like a charm. 

If you're looking for a sleep strain, look no further!”"
gmartinez172,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1385394,"“Well first off I lit this bad boi up with a pre-roll. Walked around a bit, and found myself in the garage sitting in my car listing to some talk radio. Then finally realizing that I'm in the garage, it opens. My brother walks in sees me and waves. I wave back. Then he pushes the button to close garage door and walks in the house. That's Deep. Significance I found, that the little things are to important.”"
deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1608140,"“Deep Sleep is a piney smelling indica with a hint of funk. Tastes as delicious as anything related to Bubba should! For you conventional stoners, it won't put you to sleep. It's quite relaxing but doesn't leave you drooling. This means for me that I stay functional. Personally, this strain is more of an anxiety relief and 'quick chill' option. I recommend it for beginners looking for something easy on the mind and gr...”"
rockinrhonda,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1394204,"“Excellent sleep aid. Allowed me to chill, relax on my way to getting a few zzz's. Normally don't sleep more than 2 hrs before waking up, this stretched my sleep time to 5 hrs before asking up. Nice earthy smell, taste.”"
PandaMania,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1371469,"“This is our go to Indica for when we just want to relax and sleep.”"
awsw129,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1371471,"“I really enjoyed this strain, it relaxed me and makes me me happy. One of my favorite strains.”"
lotwsandyw,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1485856,"“I love this strain and am thankful as hell I found it. I’ve never run across it in any other place I’ve been, and I’ve been to most. I have industrial grade insomnia and PTSD/Anxiety and took a handful of sleeping pills for over a decade. Deep Sleep did just that. My whole body sank into a heavy, relaxed mode, I laid my head on my pillow and drifted off...drifted off! A decade of insomnia, Ambien and PM’s killing me ...”"
highdefnition,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1371472,"“Another great OG hybrid. This one is usually Bubba dominant in smell and coloration but structure wise it has the pointed spear like calyxes from Larry. Chocolate, coffee and hashlike sweetness, not too much fuel going on but there are traces. Smooth smoke and a nice numbing sensation followed by relaxation and well, eventually sleep.”"
reedup,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1373439,"“So I've had Deep Sleep more than once. I'm not sure if I reviewed it before but damn it's hella fire. Super dank smelling like a cheesy funk to it. The high is tremendously strong.”"
theresalways2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1374888,"“Amazing cross of 2 of my top 5 strains, Larry OG and Pre-98 Bubba kush, acquired from AZ Natural Selections of North Scottsdale for 40$ a gram due to their 120$ 3G of wax special that they have fairly often. This is some top shelf medicine that I would have easily paid 50 or 60$ for a gram of this. The mix of  the heavy OG  that the Larry outputs and the Earthy Pungent phenotype acquired from the pre-98 make this str...”"
MollyW,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1523027,"“"Deep Sleep" is aptly named. Ambien does little for my pain related insomnia........Deep Sleep allows the luxury of 6 solid hours with an onset of under 30 min. To sleep, per chance to dream.....follow The Bard and score this bud. Sleep tight, no lullabies needed.”"
Pskully57,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1766238,"“It has a nice smell. That leathery smell kind of like suede. A nice mellow night time smoke. It must have been bred for the CBN compound. I got a small batch of it and I’m savoring it and conserving it because when I have insomnia, this does make me pretty sleepy. It has knocked me out a couple of times. I just put some in my bat and a couple of puffs, than put on a movie and that usually does the trick for me. It al...”"
Gerio,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1466840,"“Perfect for sleep.”"
rysterman34,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1275677,"“This strain is the perfect strain before bedtime. I vaporized some of this after I felt a migraine headache coming on and it worked wonders. Immediately made me happy enough to interact with other people and then I curled up and slept like I haven't in months. Uplifting and relaxing. Look forward to using this again soon.”"
LilMissVeg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1536784,"“Anti-anxiety, improved mood, intensified senses to satisfaction. have to get just the right dose to feel this good. I made Cannabis tea to ingest it. worthwhile experience.”"

quietgemini,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1373438,"“I didn't know what it was when I smoked it and I was expecting sativa not indica- not the fault of the strain but rather of mine- I've definitely got an intense body numbing sensation and tbh I feel like I can't move lol. I definitely want to sleep lmao. 

This isn't reacting great with my anxiety, if anything I feel more anxious, but I think that's cause I was expecting brain bot body melting.”"

Dukaness,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1371478,"“Deep Sleep - very earthy taste, like breathing in the ground. Okay to be honest, it tastes pretty gross. It's actually the first time I've been even slightly turned off by the taste of a strain. It even leaves a bit of a cigarette after taste in your mouth (even through the vape). The taste doesn't linger though. As soon as you take a drink, it goes away. The hits are pretty easy on the lungs. I have to breathe prett...”"

IandI,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deep-sleep/reviews/1371474,"“I wouldn't call this strain Deep Sleep. It's Strong, euphoric and delivers a strong body high. It didn't put me to sleep, but sure did makes me relaxed. If you do use this for sleep, make sure you're in bed and ready to crash before smoking it. That's because 30 minutes later you'll be getting up and doing late night eating binge.”"

O-pens are kinda hard but oddly enough the disposable o-pens are nice and come in sativa, hybrid and indica and all 3 were very smooth...”"
