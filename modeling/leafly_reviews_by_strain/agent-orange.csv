Agent Orange

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/agent-orange/reviews/1416646,"“People always talk about taste and smell and shit on here, and that stuff is okay, but the REASON you smoke is for the high, so that's all I'm gonna talk about.

Agent Orange, at least the one I got, is straight 50/50, and you feel that, too. You're thinking deep thoughts and laughing about it, all the while riding on a magic carpet ride that is your body. Great for dulling pain.

This was the first thing I smoke...”"

The opposite of paranoia/anxiety - in fact, it washes it away with a warm, comforting atmosphere.

Completely reversed my seasonal depression and left me having great in depth conversations with my significant other who said she felt more of the euphoric, spacey feeling this strain is known for than I did.

The flavor is equally intoxicating. I suffer extreme joint pain, and AO is fairly effective in regard to anti-inflammatory properties. On a personal experience, I feel that AO is equally proportionate in it's sativa vs. indica qualities.

It seemed slightly more susceptible to root rot during very hot weather.  Resist the temptation to overwater during heat.  Use shade instead, if possible and keep root oxygen up.

Normally not a sativa guy. But I tried this for some acute depression and it never fails to make me smile. I also love how calm and serene my thoughts are with AO. I would definitely recommend trying it for anxiety.
