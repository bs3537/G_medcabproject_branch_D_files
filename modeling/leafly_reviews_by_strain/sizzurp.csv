The buds tend to be small but they look like they are covered in SNOW.  This strain is a total grinder killer, the high starts in your head and behind the eyes.

Smoked - 5/11/18 (this makes me sad)

Beautiful light green bud with vibrant orange hairs. 

Light - airy burn with a heavy head hit very quickly. THC tested at 24.87% CBD - 0%

The name definitely comes from the way it makes you feel - double cup of lean. However, this sizzurp is better in my experience as the Siz was predominately a head high, felt plenty of energy throughout my time.”"
