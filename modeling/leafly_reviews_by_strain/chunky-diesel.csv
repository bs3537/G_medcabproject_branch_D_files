Chunky Diesel
=============
ChicagoMedPatient,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chunky-diesel/reviews/1375375,"“Chunky Diesel is one of the best sativa-dominant hybrid strains in Illinois! Its strong diesel aroma blends with chocolatey undertones   to create a smooth yet distinct flavor suitable for any palate. Although it's certainly sativa-leaning, its Deep Chunk lineage mitigates the mental stimulation associated with a traditional Sativa, producing an effect suitable for both day and nighttime usage. I highly recommend Chu...”"
kyletuch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chunky-diesel/reviews/1397369,"“Not sure why this is listed as strictly a Sativa and not a hybrid. Cresco labs brand of Chunky Diesel is the best Diesel I've ever smoked. It is by far one of my favorite strains OVERALL(and I've tried 100's of strains). It is the PERFECT relaxing after work smoke in my opinion. I feel alert and focused but my body pain is totally gone(not numb, but actually gone). I feel it is more of an Indica-Leaning hybrid imo bu...”"
TalibDwelli,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chunky-diesel/reviews/1411833,"“Chunky Diesel - you make me want to do the truffle shuffle.  Cresco really knocked it out of the park with this one!  Loving the combination of old-school genetics with the ever-popular Sour Diesel notes.  The flower has a light green color with incredible resin density.  Smells like someone dusted freshly cut flowers with fruit smoothie bits.  Killer!  Being more of an indica consumer, this sativa is PERFECT for me ...”"

NaturesWayMedicine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chunky-diesel/reviews/1698116,"“Chunky Diesel can now be found in Pennsylvania despensaries and is pretty popular among patients who suffer from chronic pain, inflammation, 
 and arthritis. Patients who also suffer from depression and stress say this works wonders also. Chunky Diesel has a distinct chocolate and coffee taste and aroma thats really enjoyable. It also has noticable frost like trichomes all around the flower.”"

ChiTownConnoisseur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chunky-diesel/reviews/1331798,"“I've been missing this strain since I tried it in Denver, glad to see it pop up in Chicago. One of the best diesels around; dense/purple nugs with excellent resin content. The smell is as punchy as Sour Diesel, but with more coffee/chocolate notes. The flavor has sweet elements in amongst the funk, nice distracting experience.”"

Cresco Yeltrah
Chunky Diesel RSO
65.8% THCA
500 mg syringe 
100 doses per 500mg syringe 
 
Incredibly sticky.  Slight weed aroma.  I didn’t get a 100 doses from the 500 mg syringe and I don’t think anyone anywhere will either ever.  I got 5 doses.  The few doses that I did get helped me relax for hours.  Had cotton mouth and the munchies.  Took about 45 minutes to an hour before I felt it.”"
CaptainQuazar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chunky-diesel/reviews/1716746,"“Chunky Diesel produces a dense bud that fluffs up in volume when ground. A strong gasoline soaked dark-chocolate flavor is surprisingly pleasant. A warm tingly, pain relieving body buzz settles in after a few minutes, while the pleasant mood lifting head high is nearly immediate. Pairs nicely with some 70s era feel good AM pop.”"
Gabelovesguac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chunky-diesel/reviews/1527918,"“I’m a big fan of Sour Diesel, so my dispensary told me about Chunky Diesel. The characteristic diesel smell was apparent as soon as I opened the package. The smoke was earthy, and smooth. I used this strain right before I went to workout and it provided me with a consistent energy boost throughout. The mix of the indica deep chunk also helped my muscle recovery. I would recommend this strain for someone who is lookin...”"
moonstar11187,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chunky-diesel/reviews/1442706,"“Illinois THC around 23%. This is probably my favorite day time strain. It's strong even though the potency is sometime not as strong as other, the combo of whatever terps make up this plant is a big win. However it is very smelly , don't be surprise if your neighbors next door can smell it , and the smell lingers for a very long time”"

The chocolatey smell is wonderful and still offers that nice diesel undertone that I love.  A great strain to medicate with if you plan to be in a social setting.”"
MickeyJenkins,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chunky-diesel/reviews/1499134,"“The overwhelming skunk diesel of this strain often throws me off since I prefer most sweet/fruity strains, but the effects of the Diesel cannot be denied. One of the best "up" highs I have had this year. Clear and focused with a very good taste to it once you get past the smell. Works really well for me as an mood enhancer and nausea reliever.”"

Chunky Diesel is in our regular rotation for hybrids. It's not my favorite, but it's a crowd pleaser for sure... I know that with Chunky Diesel, everyone will enjoy it and have a good time. The way it hits me is almost like a very chill, more balanced Headband. There's a burst of mental energy and mood lifting, and it settles into a calm...”"
