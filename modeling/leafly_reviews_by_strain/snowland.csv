NerdyMo420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1383167,"“Very nice hybrid. I am a pretty heavy smoker, so it takes a good strain to really get me to feel "stoned" and this one did it for me :) 
Your brain is filled with happy thoughts and stress and depression fade away. It's very relaxing in the body as well as the mind but not too heavy to keep you from being productive. All in all I would say a very good hybrid with the best of both worlds and no anxiety or paranoia. If...”"
germanduchess,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1326163,"“Good for a balanced, smooth high.  I can feel it in my head and my body and it makes me feel very warm and relaxed.  Very good for relaxing.”"
FemmeSnazzy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1357672,"“Holy Hell, I am in love. This beautiful hybrid strain is leaning towards the sativa-dominant side, but in the best possible way. After a massive anxiety attack, this delicious, candy-flavored strain is perfect for re-centering and coming back down to Earth. Everything is prettier after Snowland consumption. Furthermore, music sounds even better, food tastes better, and the world ceases to be so cruel for a few hours....”"
sud0,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1271732,"“Very tasty strain.  It's a one two punch for nausea.  My room mate suffers from gallstones and this stuff is like an antidote for gallbladder attacks.  I don't typically need meds for nausea, but seeing is believing and I saw a complete change in her health.  Would recommend to anyone with tummy problems!”"
Dastomba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1539852,"“I enjoyed the more Indica dominant phenotype and will agree with the rest, this is a very strong medication. Very euphoric and giggles aplenty. Smoke a little more and you’ll be stuck. Very sticky and resinous, buds were nicely manicured and pretty to look at. Good tasting. This would qualify as a weekend med as it is a little unpredictable on effect/stone. Enjoy”"
WhiteLioness,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1355698,"“Highly resinous lime green nuggets, extremely frosty with trichomes with the ones I put a bright light to; I compared them to glittering dew. The smell was pungent, yet the taste was fruity and lemony and we couldn't get enough. However, two puffs was enough because it was a hard hitting, euphoric head high that lulls you to either a creative state or a soothing deep sleep whether what you are intending to do. 5/5 wo...”"
Obowls,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1308498,"“So far really enjoying this strain. I find it has more of an earthy taste than described by other users. As far as looks buds are light green with light crystals and a shit ton of em. The effects are ranging from euphoric to a very heady easy to focus high. Overall a great find I doubt I'll find this one again”"
Produceking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1625598,"“Nice even balance high. Strong snowcap smell and taste. (A good thing)..$$$.14 ..1/8 $$$ a with for 26% THC. God I love Oregon....”"
tasha7131,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1340294,"“We tend to get this one often. A very nice hybrid! Smooth when used in concentrate form”"
Spacepuppy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1552607,"“I buy this if I see it.

Sativa effects pronounced at the start, but without anxiety. Its fluffy fast, not focused.

The comedown is sleepy.

But it is a nice high, stoney and fun.

Taste is kinda nutty pine. Not unpleasant, but nothing special.”"
Rangerman888,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1553517,"“Excellent crop at greenplanet @ canyon.   Good $ .and 27 % thc.   Strong and smooth.  Also sweet deals on gsc and 10mg CBC honey sticks.  🥂 cheers”"
Ladyopal420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1544178,"“Such a wonderful strain! Within minutes my lower back pain, muscle cramping, and anxiety was lifted! The smell was sweet and subtle, not too skunky or earthy, the hits are gentle (for me), and the density of each nug is thick and frosty. I felt my mind stop racing within minutes, was able to have a long but clear headed conversation with my husband, and followed it up with a long nights rest. The only side effect was...”"
fyrlite,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1699536,"“This could be a new favorite. As it relates to mood I think the best way to describe the effects as “at peace” -not overly euphoric or giggly. It reduces anxiety without reducing productiveness.”"
SamTheAtlantean,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1668393,"“Let me just say that this strain might be my favorite as of this moment. Everything on it from the flower to the terpenes; it all fits my liking perfectly. As such, I highly recommend that this strain be tried by anyone after a potent yet balanced high. It hits a little heavy for me, which incidentally I'm into right now. Extreme creative bursts are felt constantly throughout. It's a bit hard to feel 'active' at the ...”"
koldslaw,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1688240,"“for me personally, I love the smell and I loved the taste. I was unable to enjoy it though. it gives me intense anxiety attacks and doesn't help me to relax. I really wanted to love it, it's a beautiful bud.”"
snow4ever,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1692360,"“Picked up an eight of NWCS legends brand. listed as 30% thc. A little harsh, even vaping, it made me cough more than usual.  Very nice happy high, relaxing too, nice tingling sensations in my toes. LA confidential is one of very favorites, and shows up in this strain, just like LA CON, Snowland is a great strain for musical enjoyment.I'm a very long time fan of reggae, and this is one of those strain that really brin...”"

factorx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1664506,"“When it comes to playing guitar SnowLAnd is my absolute hands-down favorite.  I have a great time, every time.  It's easy to find my groove and everything that comes out sounds super-satisfying (to me, anyways!)  Seriously, this is so much fun to jam with.”"
Kay18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1547874,"“This produces a great relaxing head high and tastes decent. It smells more pungent than it tastes - the actual flavor is almost nutty or dry.”"
aadakyn_sage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1729840,"“76 Farms does it again with SnowLand is a 50/50 hybrid. She has hints of citrus and lemony traits. Relaxed friendly feelings of creative happiness, as well as increased appetite. I was able to eat a meal. Good for joint pain, muscle soreness, stress and depression. Able to make a meal and do light house work with decreased pain was nice. The steadier tolerance I have, the longer pain relief I feel. Maybe great to pai...”"
nslipknot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1791201,"“My gosh this strain. This strain hits me from head to toe with an almost opiate numbing sensation.  Too bad more people dont grow this strain.”"
jupiter.rising,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1514533,"“Listen kids, this strain isn't a joke.  It is so mentally lofty it's like I'm higher than God. I'm looking down and God's like, "Hey, dude, get back down here..."”"
Father_Sensei,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1703333,"“Makes me feel really relaxed and happy”"

sammibee23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1323041,"“So wonderful! The taste is amazing and the smell is like a sweet diesel and the high is tingly and slightly numbing. Helped my back and neck pain!”"
Oceanlvr420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1690676,"“This flower hit me more like an indica rather than a hybrid and kinda kicked my butt into the chair. I would prefer to smoke this closer to evening when I have nothing left to achieve in my day.”"
tommywagemann,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1656240,"“Got bud grown by Oscar Meyer wieners and it’s such a gas strain. Great head high”"
antman8354,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1326193,"“Just got this as a strain to try while on a budget cause you cant beat $89 for 28g and its awesome . Gives a nice high and would be great for someone who is still starting out, or someone looking to try stronger strains, Id def recommend this one. if you have a high tolerance, like me, it still gave me a pretty good high and it helped me sleep right away without making me crave the entire kitchen pantry to eat.”"
Shelbytritchler,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1649659,"“delicious. awesome high. great taste, all around great strain. 5 star for sure”"
androgynice,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1639180,"“Incredible smell and flavor. Bright buds with a floral, sweet scent. I have a very high tolerance and after one bowl of this I was sooo blazed. Someone asked me if I had pink eye lol. One of my favorites ever :o. Thank u weed lord”"
BHCRUSTY,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1519112,"“This is one of my favorites. it has a great affect of relieving pain, relaxing and getting me to sleep.”"
WashingtonGreenery23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowland/reviews/1279672,"“Looks great smells almost as pungent as a good Dutch treat. Very fruity. 26% thc. However the high doesn't match the looks or smell. Average high. Still worth a try. Maybe a different farm may do better”"
