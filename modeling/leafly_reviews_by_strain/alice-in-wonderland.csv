And it has a really interesting smell - my sensory vocabulary won't do it justice; I leave it to your nose.  I purchased the Cannasol Farms variety at Green Theory in Bellevue - very nice inside.  Priced somewhere in the 20s/g.  Smoked it last weekend - smooth, but not a ton of flavor to go with the uncommon smell.  Anyway that's kind of beside the point.  It starts with a mild relaxation, then transition...”"
MadamBumblebee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alice-in-wonderland/reviews/1416428,"“I love this strain. I'm a very high-strung ADHD type and this strain is paradoxical and interesting. I feel relaxed but motivated to  do stuff still. I'm currently smoking AK-47 but in comparison it's much more of a downer than Alice in Wonderland. Recommend for people with pain (lupus here) and for people who don't want munchies or lethargy. Makes me creative and curious. I have agoraphobia  and Alice in Wonderland ...”"

It simply does all the things a strong sativa-dominant hybrid should do; only more so since it's in concentrate form. This strain—allegedly descending from Willy's Wonder—is a mood uplifting, depression nuking, stress reducing machine. Super smooth and tasty on the uptake, it had us in happy land f...”"

Alice in wonderland is a solid sativa with plenty of head high. For me what makes it unique is its ability to conquer time. I swear, every time I vaporize this I can be grooving to some music (Stravinsky's Firebird is a great choice) I feel hours have passed, bu...”"

Be careful not to smoke too much in short amount of time because the high is very heady and it gave me a minor anxiety for about 10 minutes. Other than that, music sounds incredible, nature is very vivid with beautiful colors, and it gave me a little body-warming high. It's an incredible strain and you will not be disappointed. Try it!”"
