Top shelf shit right here, from the smell which has a sort of sweet citrus mix to it to the smoke which is a good relaxed high. A definite must try in my books!”"

It's a very potent Sativa-dominant hybrid with a great floaty buzz and a potent scent very similar to really good Dubya Diesel. Highly recommended!”"
