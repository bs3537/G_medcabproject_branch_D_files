Ratking123,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubble-cheese/reviews/1368735,"“Not as intense as other strains I have smoked as it kept me upbeat and in a funny mood.  Taste-wise the cheese was definitely more prominent with very little of the supposed 'sweetness' making an appearance...  Still a great smoke nonetheless!  Would recommend as a 'during the day' if you still need to remain fairly functional..

FapMaster420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubble-cheese/reviews/1330083,"“Great smell, look, and taste. High is more on the body side so it makes it hard to smoke and do anything too physical, plus it's a bit spacey on the head high at times. Regardless it's still a great bud for bed time or relaxing”"
Imsodazedandconfused,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubble-cheese/reviews/1175543,"“Never heard of the strain, until and I smoked and got blazed.  Underrated bud.”"

Sullybear23,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubble-cheese/reviews/1356264,"“Nice buds, can definitely tell it's a hybrid by structure and trichrome colour. As with any cheese cross, the cheese flavour remains but it won't have your whole house stinking. More on the indica side of highs, would recommend using in the nighttime, unless you have anything pure indica. But overall not bad at all, beats standard uk cheese for sure, #boycottthecheese”"
ABJenks,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubble-cheese/reviews/1166941,"“Definitely causes the stereotypical cotton mouth but they high certainly outweighs it. Very uplifting. Makes you want to be slightly productive.”"
Syncoholic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubble-cheese/reviews/1183913,"“Not the strongest indeed, I can function easily with this strain. Makes me laugh a bit :)”"
sebtodd,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubble-cheese/reviews/1170707,"“Not strong at all, but still gives you a nice head buzz.”"
SafetyLast,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubble-cheese/reviews/1445804,"“Smells like cheese and pinewood, same as taste, but there's an added hint of something there; it's fresh, lavender and mint, flowers. Took me 45 minutes to roll another one. Slow Mo Time. Light flashy, orby CEVs. Bad focus, but enthousiastic. Would recommend for chillout sesh with stoner friends.”"
Fuzzynuggetz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubble-cheese/reviews/1636099,"“A great mix of several potent strains. The effects are relaxing and sedative.”"
SaxInDaCity,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubble-cheese/reviews/1225035,"“It is very underrated. had it the first time when a friend of mine grew it. It gave me a pretty strong high that lasted long. it was very nice and I would really recommend to try it.”"
BradBongZ,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubble-cheese/reviews/1490283,"“almost a fruity cheese a creeper and very strong satriva like the description says and good for hunger”"
