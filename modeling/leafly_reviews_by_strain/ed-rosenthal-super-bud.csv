nevoglioungiardino,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1416861,"“Got a bit of this weed for my birthday, and i have to say i was really impressed with this strain.

You feel happy, willing to do something, not smashed but really stoned.
You can still work and is a really nice for idea's growing.
High THC Level, strong and fruity taste.

Actually one of the best weed i've ever tried.
Strongly recommended.”"

Whether you have it in your coffee, a homemade lemon square, a joint, or all three a the same time, be ready to discuss politics, math, science, money, the cultural relationships of semi-conductors, and/ or just get through the day with a calm glow no matter what the subject may be. 

Perhaps moderation is the key with this one during the day as feelings of paranoia...”"

Well I can't turn on the toons or poor the milk but I can direct you to ERSB. This would be the MOST over looked power-house Hybrid that has ever existed. Genetics that span the entire globe there is nothing to compare to this strain. The high can only be called "a perfectly played Symphony of psychoactive chemicals with complementi...”"
slc4me,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1387293,"“Great daytime smoke.  Able to smoke and still focus and chill at the same time.  Do not recommend to smoke before going to sleep.”"
Mikefu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1260346,"“I love this strain!  It is sativa enough to keep you going, but gives an almost tingly body-numbing sensation, so it knocks pain out cold without knocking you out cold.  Odd, guava/pineapple/spicy funk flavor combination that tastes really fruity with a sour undertone when vaporized.  I really, really like this strain.  One note- don't overdo it, or you WILL be paranoid and just plain unhappily high.”"

I came across Ed Rosenthal super bud @ Altitude Organics, really bizarre smell that almost turned me off of it, but I decided to grab an eighth at the bud tender's recommendation.  I'm kinda bummed I didn't grab more.  Usually I chase a dab of Harlequin with a bowl from my bong (Tolerance).  This strain evokes some strong Waves that overtake your senses.  I'...”"

acynecki,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1078281,"“I have been able to test the ed rosenthal super bud against all my symptoms today. 

I feel this is more sativa side for me especially at first but it still has the pain numbing effect that indica gives me underneath the initial high.  The pain numbing effect took a while to kick in for me.  I would say at least 30 minutes in. 

Worked immediately for my nausea. But most cannabis does.  The headache relief was took a...”"

CannabisExpert,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1685711,"“No big deal. The Strain looks like a really good outdoors. It doesn't taste that great and it gets you kind of cranky. A heavy set bud that leaves you wondering why you even bought it.”"

Strain makes very sleepy and really smells like nutt.”"

It doesn't take much to overdo it, and you'll know when you do, because it's so intense it becomes unpleasant. This stuff knocks me out, not in the sleepy way, but in the "Homer Simpson meets the Space Coyote" sort of way. Be careful with this stuff. Again, coming from a heavy user. I didn't say it's "exceptional" because it's...”"

Gives me a headache sometimes though. That is a small con for me, but its manageable”"

herbertjones,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1346047,"“Ed Rosenthal, like Sour Diesel #4 is one of those “aroma-therapy” sativas that give you a substantial body high.

This easy-smoking strain works its way into those corners of your body that are tightly-wound and irons-out your anxieties. You can tell that Mr. Rosenthal cultivated this plant for medicinal use.

The euphoria is mild but not too psychoactive.”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1078279,"“Some of the best buds I ever smoked!
It is a pretty energetic high where it is easy to be social, somthing I find quite hard on indica heavy strains.

Smells and tastes great, really smelly buds.”"
aarvid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1332161,"“One of the first commercial strains I ever tried. This was readily available for a few months back in 2010, but no one grows it any more. I think I might have to add it to my garden.
This is a beautiful strain that smells and tastes happy. Earthy, woody, piney nose and a touch of citrus on the back. As soon as you inhale, a smile appears and stays on your face for hours. A very fun and uplifting head high that acts m...”"

alisonvictoria,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1265141,"“Not my favorite, but it's not terrible. I smoke for pain as well as anxiety and depression. The pain numbing aspect is great, probably the best I've tried this far, but the paranoia takes away from overall relief. 

If you aren't prone to paranoia or anxiety and are looking for good pain relief, this would be a great strain, but I'd stay away or smoke in small doses if you are.”"

SlugChrist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1686441,"“This is some of the best flower I've ever smoked. Nice, and neutral in flavor. I get some kind of spice. As far as effects, wow. This makes me feel extremely relaxed, and tired. It's hard for me to find bud these days that helps with my sleep issues, but this is the ticket. Will definitely be at the top of my list whenever I reup at the dispensary.”"

strychninecandy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1159591,"“One of my favorite strains.  Crystal-clear high, uplifting and energetic with absolutely no anxiety or paranoia.  Decent pain relief effect without any coach-lock or lethargy making this a perfect day-time smoke.  Very smooth smoke from either glass piece or glass water pipe. When vaped from VapirRise has an ethereal citrus-mint flavor.  Highly recommended.”"
laceanddagger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1423927,"“My budtender told me it was kind of like Green Crack lite, but for me it wasn't energizing at all. It was a nice mellow lazy body feel and I basically worked on a drawing all day, so it was good for focus and creativity! I like it, but I probably wouldn't smoke it if I was going to hang out with anyone in the near future. It fades off nicely after an hour or two though.”"
DarwInitiative,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ed-rosenthal-super-bud/reviews/1078280,"“Great fruity strawberry-like taste with a hint of piny haze flavour. Strong.
Best MJ I've had so far. The phenotype I had was Sativa-dominant and carefully selected. Dopest dope. Hands down!
Thanks Ed!”"

At first I felt very creative the type of bud that makes ya want research things work etc.. But then it was followed by that heavy Indica couch lock feel. Heavy feel on the inhale. Nice nuggy buds, dark green with swirls of orange hairs with a nice coat of frost with a great taste as well. This Strain is a must try for those with a high tolerance ....”"
