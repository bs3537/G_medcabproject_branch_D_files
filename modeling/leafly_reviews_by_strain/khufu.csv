I'm sitting here talking to my wife about how emotional it's making me and that it almost makes me want to cry how good this stuff is making me feel. Like I just can't get a smile off my face, and it's such a chill high. Seriously, I haven't had this good of flower in months. Like that has made me feel this awesome. Very relaxed body high. Very Euphoric. Definitely feeling the munchies a...”"
shhurricane,https://www.leafly.com/indica/khufu/reviews/1284722,"“Not a bad strain at all. I chose this strain due to the high cbd levels. when first smoked it's very sedating but yet a little uplifting. after an hour it wears off and helped me fall asleep. good strain overall a nice indica”"
Ryno602,https://www.leafly.com/indica/khufu/reviews/1374436,"“Wonderful red hairs coat a very dark and dense bud. The high is immediate/strong, this strain may be one of my new favorites for night time 😏”"
aincardone,https://www.leafly.com/indica/khufu/reviews/1290531,"“First time I tried this strain I was not incredibly impressed. Wish I could remember where I got it. The second time I got it from Bloom PHX and it was incredible. The CBD content was around .9% and the THC was 20%+. Really enjoyed it.”"
highdefnition,https://www.leafly.com/indica/khufu/reviews/1284454,"“Just like the name suggests (after the egyptian pharaohs pyramid) the calyxs stacked like crazy and it was just one huge pointed nug. Cheesy and earthy with hints of pine trees and hash. It tastes like you would expect from the genetics used in the cross. Effects were classic indica with just a touch of some headiness. Good for appetite stimulation and pain/ anxiety.”"
Ganjagoddess446,https://www.leafly.com/indica/khufu/reviews/1364992,"“I am re-rating this. Khufu is the love of my life. I just slept the best sleep I have had in maybe 7 months. It put me in such a deep sleep that I woke up from 4 1/2 hours later feeling a little tired but still the most well rested I have felt in forever. I don't feel groggy or like I have no energy, but like I can go get up and do something! It is amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!”"

aesp444,https://www.leafly.com/indica/khufu/reviews/1288936,"“First time I tried it in vapor and do not like it. It's medicinal value for Insomnia for me had me in some outrages nightmares. 
Did not help me for sleep. Will use it early in the evening to try to salvage the cartridge since I just bought it.”"

Ganjagoddess446,https://www.leafly.com/indica/khufu/reviews/1364970,"“Khufu is .. gentle, if you will. It gave me a very nice head high and then rocked me into a sweet relaxation and before I knocked out, gave me some munchies. It was perfect for me because I suffer from anxiety and it just really relaxed me but it didn't couchlock me. 10/10.”"
