Aloha
=============
FoxyRex,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1413340,"“Great daytime/morning strain, I have Tourette's Syndrome and this suppresses my tics while keeping me active all day, I normally switch to an indica at night though as this does keep me awake”"
LadySizzle,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1415508,"“This is one of the most pungent strains that I've encountered. Loose-ish buds make it easy to grind without too much stickiness.

It's a sativa for sure with upbeat & creative feelings, great for day time use. Mediocre on pain relief. More head high than body high.”"
BudzLightyear,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1369209,"“Its pretty good as far as I know. I live in Greensboro, North Carolina, so it's better than most of these fucked up strains we get out here.”"
Selsky,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1385321,"“It's hard for me to find a Sativa that doesn't make me anxious or paranoid but I didn't have that problem with this strain. it could be better but for the price, it was very good. Gave me a slight headache after a little while but all in all, I will buy again.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1472881,"“What an interesting strain. Has the aroma of grass clipping & citrus. For me it wasn't a very noticeable high. Put me in a great mood though. I bet this strains great for depression or any mood disorders. 
I can't wait to come across Aloha in shatter/crumble. It's cool retrying strains I've only had as flower, but trying them in concentrate form.
Great to smoke with small group of friends, play videos games, listen t...”"
Sbc421truck,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1144281,"“Good for a budget. Never had it bad or bomb. It's good. I'd recommend it.”"
Dread80,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1369206,"“A good overall sativa. Definitely gets your thoughts going for sure. Also is great for muscle and nerve pain. 

Overall kinda like a jack herer feel, but as I said, your mind races, but no negative or bad felling or thoughts.

if you need to get chores or housework done. this is a good strain for it.”"
IandI,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1369203,"“Meh. Wife enjoyed it way more than I did, and had some energetic effects from it. Is somewhat uplifting, but also not very potent, and nothing like a Hawaiian strain.”"
Sublime1993,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1392232,"“Boost in energy, though nothing strong for me. Cerebral uplifted head high that can help get you out of a bad mood, and was functional on Aloha as well. It was overall alright, but wouldn't mind smoking it again for the smell and taste. I recommend Aloha for a morning and day time use. 
For sure Aloha will kill headaches, and moderate pain. You could use it for anxiety related problems since I didn't feel anxious or ...”"
tilldeathfitness93,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1307666,"“More to follow...but I bought this strain from 112th St Cannabis in Puyallup, WA thinking it was (and seeing it advertised as such) a strong, energy inducing sativa. When I got the bud home I realized that the packaging sticker had each gram labeled as an indica. I'm halfway through a bowl of it as we speak; I'll fill you guys in on the rest as it develops!”"
jagertoke,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1369205,"“Euphoric strain that leaves you uplifted and energized. If grown right, this strain is killer. Buds are light and fluffy with a potent citrus smell to them. They pack a hit.”"
insanemoe,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1386718,"“The SMELL on this one is absolutely PARADISE.
I was really creative and my mind was on point !”"
vidrean2017,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1388866,"“Ok so,this strain?  Makes me so giggly and happy,  I love it. I deal with depression and this helps me calm my mind, be more aware and help me be positive. Would recommend to anyone wanting to laugh and have a good time. I like that it doesn't make me lazy, it just gives me lots of energy.”"
Bighommieproductions,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1680239,"“ALOHA! Love it! Shot out to Kush! Thanks for suppling the best Sativa on the Market. Looking for it for almost 2 weeks. No one had it and I traveled far to get it. It’s everything Leafly describes it to be. I can’t wait to share it with some close HOMMIES.... ALOHA!”"
docgf,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1369207,"“Terrific for dealing with nerve pain and still getting chores and task done. Great head clarity and relaxation”"
Spunkie,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1369204,"“The first hit was such a surprise - this has the best taste I've ever had. Soft and citrusy but not overwhelming. Nice head buzz. Definitely a new favorite.”"
danksideoftheweed,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1624763,"“Pretty nice uplifting/happy high. Nothing special though”"
cgwinn1985,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1395241,"“This heavy hitter creeps up fast. Makes me chatty, but focused. Makes everything more fun. Definitely a good go to strain for anxiety. Use caution when vaporizing.”"
paintergirl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1419516,"“Aloha is the perfect sativa to kick out negativity and get stuff done.  When the difficulties of being a human on this planet creep in and I lose my get and go, I know that some sweet Aloha will make it all better.  

My first time smoking this strain in my bubbler  I was filled with positive vibes, creativity and desire to finish a project, and loads of energy and focus without anxiety or paranoia.

The smell of the...”"

lindze42,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1604193,"“One of my fav go to strains for a wake and bake high that doesn’t stop you from being productive...in fact I cleaned my whole damn garage last time I smoked it. 
It’s also one of my favs for that tingly/feel good body sensation that makes sex fab-u-lous~”"
lindze42,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1610435,"“This is a great wake & bake strain with a medium high strength that’s great for depression/anxiety. Good for sexy times due to the body tingles it gives. Happy and uplifting strain without kicking your ass too much. If you want an amped up version similar but with similar but stronger effects, I recommend Alien OG.”"
mindymvegan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1575917,"“Helps my nausea related to mast cell activation disorder. I can’t medicate with pepto- bismol and this happens to be the only gram I have in the house. After 4 or 5 hits I’m already not feeling as nauseas as I was. I’m giving it 4/5 stars cause I’m not sure how long the effects will last.

It tastes decent and smells good. It was recommended to me by one of the dispensaries cause they said it was similar to blue drea...”"
keionsalehi,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1418548,"“A preferable sativa, Aloha does get the job done as far as a functioning body high and some mental stimulation to a peak. The psychoactive feel is very happy and pleasant while providing affects of anti-anxiety and anti-depression. This strain makes for a good day time or sunset smoke as well as a way to toast off the evening. Aloha is truly a balanced bud for the pure sativa fans out there”"
markgarf,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1369208,"“I actually hated this strain. I did not feel euphoria or relaxation at all and instead felt paranoid and distress. Not to mention my eyes were red as hell. The nugs were pretty big and dense but the effects of this strain were just terrible.”"
Drew2u,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/aloha/reviews/1412964,"“One of the Best flowers I have tasted,and for motivation, you don't even realize you are doing something productive until your like "damn I finished,I don't remember starting! Haha love it!”"
