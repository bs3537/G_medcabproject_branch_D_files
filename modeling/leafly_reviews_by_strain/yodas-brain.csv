I enjoy being awake with this buzz and I also really enjoy it right before I get in bed. Comes with a wicked dry mouth.”"

First time I tried this was a bidder concentrate and I had only obtained from dabbing and flower smoke because I could feel a cold coming on... I had tried to start ordering grubhub and it took me what felt like 2 hours just to get the order ready.”"
itsjayme,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yodas-brain/reviews/1417801,"“Yoda's Brain is my favorite strain atm. I have not found anything I like better. this is the strain for you if you want a heavy high. I've bought it maybe twice and never saw it again...so if you see it in so-cal let me know!”"

I picked up a gram of the shatter from Emerald avenue  (though I would say the consistency is much more like the jack herer sugar wax I got from them a while ago than shatter). Very nice concentrate here. Seems like a lot of terpenes in this one, very aromatic. Heavy notes of pine, with earthy/floral/honey u...”"
J_P,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yodas-brain/reviews/1361182,"“definitely an indica. tried it on 3 separate occasions with the gram I purchased. First time took me by surprise and had me wandering around and eating until I fell asleep. Really does make you feel like Yoda, but from the 5th movie XD. Nice to chill out, eat food, watch a movie and fall asleep. Very potent too.”"
popsmoke,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yodas-brain/reviews/1361180,"“Amazing strain for an amazing rainy day. Definitely as potent as advertised. I tried the flower from LAXCC and a couple of puffs had me wandering in the Jedi masters brain for sure. Neck and back stress melts away within seconds. No anxiety side effects, and long lasting effects.”"

Beelzedub,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yodas-brain/reviews/1369683,"“I like this strain, but the name given to me was R2-D2. We get it here in Phoenix at 10/G 35/8th. The Hindu Kush smell sticks with this and Skywalker parent. It's in my top 10.”"
Vester2018,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yodas-brain/reviews/1521607,"“An anaxing indica strain, one of two indica strains that I will now only smoke. The strain is great for insomnia and it relaxes your body and mind. The taste is smooth (I vape) so happy I have on a great find the past year for strains that help me. Definitely sleeping tonight!”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yodas-brain/reviews/1349113,"“A slow, stop and smell the roses high. Visuals are eye catching and vibrant...rich and appealing. Interesting clarity makes you feel oddly sober, yet it’s so obvious how gone you are when you think about it. Surprisingly easy to concentrate and focus. Your mind is relaxed like in cool water. Mostly chill vibe with an uplifting, child-like excitement. Physical high may outweigh mental. Soooo weighty and sedating - whi...”"

omayad,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yodas-brain/reviews/1528538,"“Enjoyable for high-tolerance patients.  I don’t particularly find it a ‘couch-lock’ experience although it can be if desired...if that makes sense.  It does atm 🔥”"
princessy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yodas-brain/reviews/1593528,"“Really loving this strain atm! I’ve been very fatigued and anxious lately from working 60 hour weeks but this works wonders helping me relax and calm my mind at night! I feel relaxed without feeling too hazey or stone-y. Very good strain to slowly ease yourself to sleep.”"
