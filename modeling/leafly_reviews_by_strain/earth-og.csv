BeenBlowinOG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1275258,"“I love planetary strains, and I am also a strictly indica kind of guy, but by far this is one of my favorite planetary strains. Because of it being bred with one of the dankest sativas on this earth, it doesn't delay with its hard hitting indica high. Most co-op will actually shelf this as an indica because if you don't know its actual lineage you will think it is an straight indica. If you love getting high, and rel...”"
mpbuckley,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1353043,"“Great strong but comfortable high. Great day or night. Makes me feel happy, relaxed and content. If  smoke a little it gives energy but if i smoke a lot it makes me sleepy. Great for pain and nausea. Great go-to strain for whenever you wanna get high.”"
brian318,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1328098,"“This hybrid is absolutely amazing for anxiety...mildly euphoric and very happy bud..as well as giving you a total sense of well-being. It also comes on very easy. Definitely gonna get it as often as possible.”"

Picked up half a gram of this at Zen OC in Garden Grove.
It was the weekend so i decided to pick up this strain as Wax, boy was I glad I made this choice, although I do not believe Zen had this as a flower.
Wax: Tan with mix of darkk deep green. Crumbly and easy to work on a dabber. 
Smell: Earthy, hint of citrus, and sharp OG.
Taste: A fat dab of this resulted in a mouthful of FLAVO...”"

smstm1103,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1526091,"“Enjoyed a bit of wax from this lovely strain in the hopes it’d kill my 5 day migraine. All I have to say is I feel like there are little midget hands rubbing my temples and whispering sweet nothings into my ears.  Love this stuff.”"

WeedMuhreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1801573,"“Just killed an oz of this. Positive vibes with this strain. Great for my back depression and stress. Great for wake and bakes and getting the day started, but too much and fuhgedabotit! Then my high ADD kicks in. But great strain”"

bud4dayz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1233127,"“Holy F***! I'd been seeing this strain at my local club for a while now, but passed it up until today.  It smelled very earthy (the name haha) and I had to buy some.  Immediately I felt a strong cerebral head buzz and a mild but still dense body high.  Reminds me of my earlier smoking days when all strains would knock me out.  No headaches like some other strains give too”"

Cundrie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1223844,"“if u take a lot it will knock u out because its a hybrid but its effects are very stong mentally and physically which is really cool. I love the stickiness but that makes it very hard to grind.”"

TheOfficeOC,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1478044,"“Earth OG is a very natural and woody strain. Stemming from Sour Diesel, and Ghost OG. This Flower has great medicinal properties. Great for Depression, sleep , and appetite control, this strain can be smoked throughout the day without having the "overly "medicated" feeling.”"

neoleafbaron,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1575578,"“Tranquilizing, but not sedating. Pretty energizing and has therapeutic effects. I'm not very good at describing smells and flavors, though I would say it has a sharp, strong pine smell. With perhaps a hint of sweetness. Just my two cents.”"
rpgzealot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1605658,"“Very weed-smelling weed; incredibly hoppy. The entire room smells like a frosty IPA, though without the bitterness. Anvery smooth, relaxing high that slides up your shoulders and finishes behind your eyes, illiciting a dopey grin and a ravenous appetite. Wears off very quickly, leaving a profound sense of everythibg-id-awesomeness.”"
BeeNash,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1245424,"“This strand has a strong dirt, earth, woody taste to it, very earthy. It's not a bad taste but it's that great either. This is not a cougher strain but the high was pretty amazing. This strain has a very strong OG taste, HEAVY body high. Rating 8.8 out of 10.”"
berry35,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1357984,"“I really liked this. I mixed it with J1, so I can't say how much of this review is due to the earth og, but I'll try. I was a bit shaky but overall felt physically comfortable. Headache pain relieved by the high, but came back around the comedown, but I can't blame the weed for that. Very focused, can laugh, can write and take time to be introverted, more appreciative, calmer, floating. Felt fine to sit and watch a f...”"

   strawberry flavors tended to show over blueberry, but with deep, heavy earthy undertones that trailed with quick heavyset coughs ranging Almost until ur next hit which compressed the undertones. A sharp paranoid episode occurred right after. heart beat slightly raced. after applying a control, Hunger became more evident which applied to a deep charge to my endocannabinoid glands for...”"
drewdeezus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1689172,"“Easy to breakdown and a pungent earthy lemony smell. Flavorful smoke that leads to a wonderful full body high.

10/10 Recommend to a bud 🌲”"
zeusatp,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1260322,"“like one of the other reviews...  I too am an indica smoker.  I have gotten paranoid/anxious with weed in the  past.  Now I only smoke Indica.  This Hybrid hits you hard the first hit you take a hit(body/head).  But the head high will go away quite quickly.  The Body high is extremely relaxing and will knock u out.  It is a very pleasant high.  
PS...  I'm a Skywalker (indica) smoker..  this is a nice change of pace....”"
Gelle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/earth-og/reviews/1357342,"“I did not care for this at all. Firstly, the high isn't potent at all - I couldn't even feel like I had been smoking, even two bowls in. Secondly, it gave me a headache immediately, and it only intensified as the come-down continued. To top it off, this strain gave me massive paranoia which ramped up my anxiety ten-fold.”"
