PimpGrinch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghanica/reviews/1412461,"“Dominant Afghan taste, form and quality of high coupled with dominant Skunk yield, vigour and general potency gives you the cream of the crops.”"
Eric420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghanica/reviews/1132894,"“Afghanica has your traditional afghani smell but more sweeter with a slight smell of tea, not my favorite smelling strain, i like more of the strong pungent smelling strains but if u like afghan this will be a nice choice, the effects are very nice not strong, pretty uplifting with a nice relaxing, focused stone. perfect strain for the afternoon.  good for a beginner not over powering . ill give this a 4 out of 5.”"

Great smell and taste. I loaded a pipe and sat down to smoke it. After a short while, my roommate asked me why it smelled like a skunk in the living room. I showed her the bowl, then had to go smoke it because it was stinking up the apartment. lol”"

un hibrido entre skunk y afghani con el duce aroma de la skunk1 de la vieja escuela ( recuerda un poko a uk cheese) y la carga de resina de la afghani con un efecto relajante y un remarcable sabor dulce acaramelado y floral.”"

WakeAndJake,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghanica/reviews/1163370,"“Not the most potent strain I've had but I've never had a strain smell like tea before... Afghanica provided one of the smoothest smokes ever, every hit felt like nothing even from a joint.”"
Shnovets,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghanica/reviews/1260145,"“What I got was from W.F.C. Called "reserve" so I had to google what it was. 4 because I just tried. When I review I try to do a 3 hit, wait a bit and after that state my opinion... I've noticed that at times... the second time even with same bag it changes. With that being said. It's a very "high" mellow-like FIRE! Good referral from budtender!!  I love it.”"
Eric420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghanica/reviews/1060966,"“I love me some afghanica i find when i smoke it i get a real heavy sativa for the first 15 minutes then in like 30 mins it will just feel like a heavy indica i feel like just relaxing, its pretty potent”"
