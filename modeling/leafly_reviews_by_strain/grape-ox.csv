Two bong hits of this and I literally put my head back and blasted off.  It took me to a beautiful place Spiritually,  and melted all my back pain away with waves of bliss and comfort.  Highly Recommend!”"

They were very short very Indica like leave and structure did not get over 4 feet but very thick stalks and  had many bud sites at least with nutes I was using And it's has like it says a blueberry skunk on inhale and a sour like grape on exhale real tasty and the medical side its awesome cause it has high CBD and high THC can't ask for anything better..”"

Moderate dose: Powerful, intense, the body high with this one is next level. Charges your body like an angry ox, suddenly hitting you with an extreme body that you will not see coming. Kept me happy and relaxed for a while too 10/10
High dose: Put me to sleep like a baby. ...”"

_Loudpack508,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-ox/reviews/1414347,"“Very tasty strain with a strong Grape aroma! Gave me some paranoia and a heavy headache, though it helped my insomnia and depression. I would say that the headachey feel might be an attribute of the THC content, but don't let that deter you from this strain!”"
on1ygoodvibe5,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-ox/reviews/1386803,"“Looks: Darker color than I usually like from concentrates, but given the genetics and how purple the flowers were I guess it's to be expected. Thick sugary goo consistency and was easy to get dabs off the gram. Good clarity as well.
Smell: Spicy, sandalwood, grapes, berries, musky coffee smell and sweet almost grassy smell. Very unique. 
Taste: Low temp tastes like grape ape and a subtle coffee flavor a lot more of t...”"

danceswithsocks,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-ox/reviews/1300115,"“fabulous for nighttime, helps to relax, let go, and get some good rest. not quite a 5 star though, simply because it doesn't quite get there with the euphoria.”"
