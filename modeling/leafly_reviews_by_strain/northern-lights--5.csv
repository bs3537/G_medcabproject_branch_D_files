I've smoked it in an enclosed area as well as outdoors in nature.  Both times I had a blast! 

I was researching about something, and decided to have a puff.  I immediately felt intrigued and motivated about the topic I was researching; I felt focused, uplifted, creative, and passionate about what I was doing.  

I also smoked this on the beach and outdoors in the forest. It was an awesome ...”"

Very nice head high with an accompanying body high. Lit up a bowl tonight and remembered why I loved it so much. Stimulates creativity very nicely! If you ever see a nice batch of NL #5 GET IT. Thats all I have to say.”"
vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights--5/reviews/1391577,"“Vaped about 300 mg. Nice kind of citrus earthy smell. Add a hint of cool pine and you got the taste, smooth almost all the way to the end.  *Excellent pain relief, and on a day it was most needed*. Nice indica head effects, kind of day-dreamy in a comedic kind of way.  Melted into a tub of hot water and listened to music while my thoughts floated away and my body pain dissolved into the bath. Some moments, music was ...”"

I have a hard time finding products that do not cause difficult negative effects along with the positive. Some help my pain, but make my anxiety go off the charts, others calm me, but don’t help my pain.

But this strain has changed EVERYTHING for me! It makes my pain melt away, I feel happy and light hearted and my anxiety disappears. Plus, despite being...”"
Farmer4,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights--5/reviews/1378448,"“Easily my second favorite bud(AK-47 being my first). Very intense high, almost trippy in a way. Really messed with my concentration. Perfect little buds. Smoked some of this when I was a delivery driver, went to turn around in a driveway only to find out it wasn't a driveway at all, just some family's front yard! Lucky that was my last delivery for the day.....”"

This was listed as a "Reserve" strain on their menu and cost $15 more than the other 500 mg CO2 cartridges. I hesitated initially due in large part to the price difference. My line of reasoning was, "How much better could this strain really be?", and "Is it really worth a nearly 20% premium when this stuff is already expensive enough?" Brass...”"

rogopogo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights--5/reviews/1412091,"“Amazing strain. My absolute favourite. Great for depression. Personally, it makes me feel like a kid on Christmas morning. The colours are brighter, the sounds are crisper, all of a sudden life is okay and I'm just happy to be a part of it. It's great for pulling me out of a dark (or ambivalent) headspace. 

Also, one of the only strains that makes me want to be adventuring outside, rather than curl up under a blanke...”"

My blood pressure went down from 160/110 to 128/82 within a half hour. Dosage was perhaps 1/20th of a gram. I was skeptical of all the reports on the Internet about marijuana lowering blood pressure because the legitimate medical web sites are not emphasizing it.

Even though it is not the best, it tastes great, gives me no negative side effects, and gets me high as hell.  When I smoke this stuff, I feel like making all kinds of stuff like bongs, pipes, steamrollers, and even get creative with joints like cross and diamond joints.  I made a bong out of a supersoaker that we called "The Shotgun" while on this.  Incredible stuff, I recommend this to a...”"

I took this for my severe insomnia and I swear I have never had such refreshing sleeps in my life.  

Not only that, but my friends noticed (not me, I was too high) that I calmed down completely and was able to converse without pacing or getting derailed/stuttering (a symptom of my anxiety).

I will continue to buy and smoke this amazing, tasty strain.”"

Kaliskunk28,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights--5/reviews/1217335,"“What a fantastic strain...
Mmm, this one is nice, very fruity and citrus at the same time. There's a sweet quality to the buds. 
The smoke is thick and tastey. Very nice fresh fruity cirtus taste too. There is a hashy after taste that is very earthy and gives off an onion/funky taste...

I love this one because it's not too complex; it is what it is, sour fruity goodness.”"

Also works as a great pain reliever - it helped me recover from a minor surgical procedure without any prescription painkillers. My only complaint is that it tends to make me less talkative than normal and I run the risk of getting really lost in my own thoughts, so it's not great for using with friends.”"

Jouri,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights--5/reviews/1240598,"“Really lovely strain. Smoke this every time I go to the Netherlands. A lot of strains get boring/repetitive but this one never disappoints me! 

The smell is nice. You can definitely notice something earthy about it, maybe the citrus if you have a good nose. 

The smoking experience is pleasant. Mellow in the throat and noticeable flavours. Really has something different to it compared to other strains. 

The effects...”"

angryjon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights--5/reviews/1132409,"“Fights depression well, but sour grape is probably better.  Not super long lasting.  Doesn't come down well, seems to be one that guarantees I'll find something else to vape when it wears off.

Arousal comes on fast though, which is a nice thing for it to do.”"

jacobtr,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights--5/reviews/1376764,"“This is one spectacular strain. Once smoked I usually get in bed, on my laptop and start writing. This strain offers a very sweet mellow high that allows you to sink comfortably into your chair. When smoked outside this strain makes the night sky dance wondrously as the stars and moon glow above you.”"
crehnlund,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights--5/reviews/1391523,"“Very sticky buds! When I purchase my medical cannabis I prefer my strains more sticky so my "budtender" told me pure indica would help my pain and fall asleep. Writing this now with a full body high and muscles relaxed I'm ready to get good sleep, haven't slept well. Very mild to inhale not harsh, more body high than head high, almost at couch locked position. Lol”"

Improved taste, improved resin production, easier to grow and even more enjoyable then it's predecessors. It's citrus and woody taste mixed with the incredible body stone are what set it apart.
Excellent for a night smoke, but still great doing the day if you are not doing anything really serious. This is one of my all-time favorite strain.”"
vhawk29,https://www.leafly.com/indica/northern-lights--5/reviews/1280617,"“super easy to grow. first ever grow tested out at 22%. Heavy feeder, responds well to lots of pruning by making heavier and heavier resin.
