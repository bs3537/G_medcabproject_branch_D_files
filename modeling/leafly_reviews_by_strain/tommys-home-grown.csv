GinoMidnight,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tommys-home-grown/reviews/1244144,"“This strain is good. Definitely gives you a great high and you feel really relaxed after. It's nothing too special though and it makes your thoughts really foggy. It's definitely a great strain, but it's nothing extremely memorable.”"
mrgreenurpastures,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tommys-home-grown/reviews/1255060,"“i think if it was grown right it would be bomb”"
Samphx1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tommys-home-grown/reviews/1244027,"“Excellent  alert, calm feeling. Feels like a nice, clear-headed Sativa. Great for daytime use, I didn't get any paranoia.”"
HottAzMomma,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tommys-home-grown/reviews/1267727,"“If I could meet Tommy I would kiss him! This strain is a perfect balance of head stimulation with a light body buzz. I normally go for indicas but this is my 'steady Eddy' at the end of my day. It cuts through my mind buzz to relax me and loosen my muscles so I can wind down. I love this strain!!”"
martinezd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tommys-home-grown/reviews/1212057,"“This is one of the four new Certified Tommy Chong Strains only available at Encanto Green Cross Dispensary.
I got to try three of the four but this was the most sativa dominant.

It has a tropical taste with a hint of earthly flavor, and brings to mind that comfortable feeling of home.  I was energetic and uplifted.  
Dispensary recommends THG to aid in stress, depression, and a variety of inflammatory conditions.”"
imjustagirl1979,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tommys-home-grown/reviews/1236442,"“This is the best of the 4 Tommy Chong Certified Strains I have tried.  It's definitely a hybrid and has the best effects of both worlds.  highly recommend you try it.
I think they only have it at Encanto Green Cross in Phoenix”"

Princeofcool,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tommys-home-grown/reviews/1696503,"“Was browsing selections the clerk suggested this, frankly it looked like dried up tops of pussy willow.  I held off until I was told it was on sale.  Why not.   

Reminded me of what we smoked in high school, bad taste, no real high and it occurred to me Tommy must have found some stash from the 70’s and put it out there.  

I ended up giving away buds of it here and there as gifts, no great feedback.  

If offered, ...”"
Cr420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tommys-home-grown/reviews/1248076,"“Very impressed with this Sativa.  Great sweet earthy smell and same kind of taste.  Feel alert but yet relaxed.  Desert Bloom has this on stock right now, I highly recommend!”"
sativafied,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tommys-home-grown/reviews/1233615,"“For a user with an extremely high tolerance, I found this sativa to actually be pretty uplifting and energetic (rare feeling for a seasoned user). I'm not quite sure what the hell roxievw -or- mrgreenpastures are talking about, but I would highly recommend this strain and have tried it very recently. It's right up there as an awesome sativa for high tolerance users.”"
kitschbitsch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tommys-home-grown/reviews/1255506,"“very disappointing strain. especially since they charge more for it because of the tommy chong label. if you're a sativa lover like me don't even bother with this. i have a high tolerance and this was not a strong enough strain to be felt whatsoever. 👎”"
PresidentDonaldTwitt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tommys-home-grown/reviews/1416648,"“Lol,  nutty?  There is no dominant nutty terpenoids. Just like "garlic".  These buds have soaked up the smell of organic pesticides. Its in the plant fiber, not the resins, very easy to tell once you start vaporizing like a modern tokers should. 

Same with these stupid "milk"  strains.  Do they come with instructions on how to grow them?  With pesticides that smell nutty, garlicy or milky?  Unless the buds smell lik...”"
