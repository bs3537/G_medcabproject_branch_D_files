Gave me an all-around vibrating sensation that lasted a long time. Not one of my favorite strains, mainly because the stuff I had tasted terrible. Either that or it tasted like nothing so all I tasted was the butane from the lighter. Tried it with hemp wick a few times and it tasted alright. Still a very potent indica though.”"

Relieved a bad case of stress neck, and eased what I'd say was a medium anxiety attack that I'd been having for a couple day. If I wanted to sleep, it would help.  If I don't want to sleep, I don't feel like I have to. I'd get this again, which proves that ...”"
