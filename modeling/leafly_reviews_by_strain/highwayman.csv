very dense flowers, cured perfectly, extremely "tingy" to the nose, and very easy smoke. no such chocolate, I taste hints of citrus, possibly pine undertones, very hard to put a finger on I but this strain is my favorite of all time for the flavor, aroma, exhale taste, and the cerebral lightfulness that's on par with a cup of coffee on a gorgeous morning”"
CharmYaChicago,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/highwayman/reviews/1333006,"“I absolutely love this new strain! Great for pain, anxiety, depression. It literally uplifts your mood instantly. With a 50/50 sativa/indica; it makes this a homerun if you ask me my opinion!👍👍👍👍👍”"
StoopidPigeon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/highwayman/reviews/1457808,"“I must've got a hold of a bad grow... this stuff looked like crap, tasted like crap, and I've already told some people it sucks. It was even from Bedford Grow which 99% of the time they have good stuff but this, I'd rather go without.”"

wickerflicket13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/highwayman/reviews/1665361,"“Snagged this strain in a beautiful honey-hued distillate that has a subtle earthy taste. Moodwise, I find it adds a lovely little bit of optimism to the start of my day and is one of the rare strains that makes me feel more creative. By far one of my favorites to help me manage my mood.”"

dankmcCheese,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/highwayman/reviews/1282673,"“Pretty shitty tbh, low thc and the density of the bud was super bad. Would only recommend to notice smokers or if you run out of options. Some highlights are that it is very easy on the throat and has a pretty ok smell.”"
chcherrybxmb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/highwayman/reviews/1362165,"“Light, frothy looking buds. Not the frostiest bud out there bud definitely a good social smoke. The backstory also makes a good conversation starter.”"
