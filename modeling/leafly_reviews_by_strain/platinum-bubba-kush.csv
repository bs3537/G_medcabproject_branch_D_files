vaporbong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/platinum-bubba-kush/reviews/1397087,"“Great floral taste and some of the strongest munchies ever.  While we were on this strain, my friend asked if he could have some of the pizza I was making and I said no.  I realized later that my munchies were so strong that I was not thinking rationally and of course split the pizza with him...and another.  Make sure you have some Red Baron pizzas standing by in the freezer.”"

The smell & taste remind me of gasoline, similar to Sour Diesel or Chemdog; which BTW are both great strains if u ask me. Anyhow, PBK has a dark green and purplish tint to it. The nugs are medium to large size and  somewhat hard and dense but still moist aswell. B-ware cuz PBK packs a punch & it's great 4 nighttime use.

Not so good for being social. I just wanted to melt into the couch and watch TV. Which also makes it great for sleep. I wake up the next morning in the exact same spot I fell asleep.
