FreakyLeafy2016,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/biker-leblanc/reviews/1254571,"“Very good head and body high, I find that if you smoke it in the morning your more energized but at night it will put you to sleep, leaf/trim/shake picks up on flavored bong water very well. An overall potent strain that packs one hell of a munchies trip so lock your fridge up.”"
lrybolt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/biker-leblanc/reviews/1258854,"“Exceptional strand with good body relaxation without putting you into the couch. I feel like this strand is more of a hybrid leaning strand. I have found this available at most Livwell locations in recreational and medical in Denver.”"
