DJChronic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gas-mask/reviews/1503174,"“I am huge indica fan, and other than my CBD strains that I use for PTSD, I manage  anxiety and chronic pain with indicas. I tried some Gas Mask, and wow! Hard hitting body high, melted me into the couch. Great for pain relief, and I slept soundly. Excellent strain for bedtime.”"

I used this to see if it could maybe help me sleep easier at night and my god I never slept better in my entire life. This strain slowly put me in a relaxed state and was a very relaxing tingly experience before I fell in the sleep dimension. Super good for sleep and relaxation, 4/5.”"

This gassy smelling weed can be picked miles away.  Having said that, the taste was much better than the smell.  I vaped it, which probably toned it down a bit from smoking it.  There was very little in the way of cerebral high, which you would expect from an Indica, but the body-high was amazing.  With each and every use my body melts...”"

Chadd720,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gas-mask/reviews/1674972,"“This strain gave off a straight body buzz. No head high at all. Gave you that tired eyes feeling as well. Deff recommend this strain for indica lovers.”"
Angus30,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gas-mask/reviews/1607775,"“This weed has a sweet bubble gum smell for miles. I just smoked a fresh sample, and wow smooth smoke with an exhale of white smoke. The after taste kicked me like a mule! No joke tasted like I just ate a handful of cherry sour patch gummies and strong citrus, what a surprise that was. Beware though it's a power House of a strain. So pucker up buttercup, light weights watch out and prepare to get gased!”"
Urbanhippie72,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gas-mask/reviews/1551939,"“I love the taste..the DANKNESS this bud holds is really amazing.. it has purples and orange to the frosty white parts. The buds are so sticky when you crack them open...there are going to be here to stay....I love them.....”"
barackobongaisback,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gas-mask/reviews/1686890,"“My favorite part about this strain is the scent! She’s super pungent and has a little bit of a chocolatey aroma. It also has beautiful trichomes. You can tell it’s an indica just by the smell and appearance alone! In regards to the type of high: relaxing, pain relieving, no cotton mouth(!). I smoked a bit due to a migraine and Gas Mask actually helped a lot. Not my favorite indica ever but will definitely repurchase!...”"

Kaimoon17,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gas-mask/reviews/1690959,"“This stuff is great. Chills me out. But then I usually pass out and sleep really hard for seveal hours. Not the kind you would smoke if you have anything else to do that day. But I do enjoy being Hella chill. Cuz im usually really high strung.”"

Kynge613,https://www.leafly.com/indica/gas-mask/reviews/1610332,"“This mind bender is a fantastic bundle of joy and happiness. Capable of knocking even the most veteran of smokers off their feet. This plants potency seems exponential  (It's over 9000!!!!!) but is euphoric in nature and relaxing in its roots and has earned a perfect rating from me.”"
