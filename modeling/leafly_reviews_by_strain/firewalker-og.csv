Firewalker og is an amazing mindfuck. Like it says, the effects are sativa dominant. All the sudden out of nowhere this shit had me and my friend giggling hysterically at absolutely nothing for thirty minutes straight. It was defintely a moment of near insanity. Looking back I think we were laughing at how ridiculously high thi...”"
EdwardEnigma,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/firewalker-og/reviews/1389725,"“Burst of happiness & energy. Similar to a senzu bean if you watched dragonball z !  Definitely something for the morning. Gets you focused”"
LordGrenville,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/firewalker-og/reviews/1489050,"“This is among the best sativas I've ever had. No raciness, absolutely no anxiety or paranoia. An uplifting euphoria with no small amount of aphrodisiacal properties.”"

sthoopth,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/firewalker-og/reviews/1671511,"“This strain intrigues me, because it doesn’t act like your typical sativa. Not only does it keep me happy and feeling creative, but I also feel relaxed throughout my body. I don’t experience anxiety or panic with Firewalker like I normally would most other sativas; just the opposite, actually. In fact, I feel like with high enough doses, I would easily fall asleep with this strain. Most definitely a new favorite of m...”"
JustinSane206,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/firewalker-og/reviews/1482893,"“Smells and tastes piney. Pretty smooth for me since I'm a fan of IPAs. The taste kinda reminds me of a Stone. Doesn't build much smoke, but it started getting me relaxed real quick. I ate dinner after. Made a pretty kick ass sandwich. After, I did some dishes while listening to music. I had one hell of a trip with that. Started on Slayer - South of Heaven, to Volbeat - Seal the Deal, and ended with NIN - Hurt. After ...”"

I went to a beyonce concert where it was super crowded then a huge wave of trembles and rapid heart beat came over me.  I had one of those bad trips ! Haven't tripped out like that in a while ! When I'm looking to zone out this is the strain I'll go to. Takes me to an interested place, nonetheless ha.”"

CaptainJacks,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/firewalker-og/reviews/1416550,"“This is a great strain, however calling it a sativa is very misleading. The effects of this strain will definitely put you in a couch lock making it an INDICA!!”"
oilbog,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/firewalker-og/reviews/1262566,"“I'm not a fan for me this strain is just a tight headache  but it's very energetic and it lasts along time that would be good if the physical effects were better the smell is ok it's a very spicy earthy smell it tastes like flowery spicy earth and sometimes a get a tropical coffee taste the buds are dark green long skinny fluffy buds with little patches of purple 

Taste 7/10
Smell 5/10
High 4/10
Smoke 2/10”"
