Tahoe Hydro OG
=============
Calicorrect,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-hydro-og/reviews/1366960,"“This strain is one of THE strongest OG's on the market! I have been able to purchase this only in Las Vegas. From what I understand it will be coming to more stores in LV along with a few in Northern NV. If you haven't tried this and you are a die hard OG fan, your missing out! Believe me, phenomenal!!! Whom ever is growing this, hats off.”"

Tastes great, and is a nice clean smoke. I chiefed this out of my one-hitter and it is awesome. The only downside is slight paranoia.”"
seshtime,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-hydro-og/reviews/1366962,"“This strain is a really smooth experience and acts pretty fast, the high is pretty good but if youre searching for something to get really high i dont recommend it, the high is mellow and doesnt last really long (around 2.5 hours) which can be either a good or bad thing. I recommend using it at work when you still need to be somewhat operational but you still wanna get your daily high”"

If you're from the bay this is the perfect morning drive up to Tahoe feeling. Little bit of The Bay from 7k (elevation). 😅 (more sativa dominated for sure) Excellent review of course, follow for more!”"

It has a super earthy taste, the buds smell like diesel & lemon & are frosty like the snowman. 🌿🌿🌿🌿 4 out 5 tress.

lawofsin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-hydro-og/reviews/1654537,"“This strain had a bitter flavor that was very earthy with a touch of pine. The effects were lightly indica seeming. I personally was not a fan of the taste as it reminded me of grass or lettuce. The effects were very subtle in my opinion. Not my favorite, I’ll stick to Tahoe OG next time.”"
peegreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-hydro-og/reviews/1492827,"“Keeping this a 5 star strain.
Best buzz in a few weeks, tastes great hits hard and fast.
 Mine came in a concentrate, great expansion.”"

goodjuju4me,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-hydro-og/reviews/1483446,"“So far my favorite, next to GDP. Whenever I want to get my home cleaned I smoke this one. Good smooth, kinda creep up on you high. I would say helps with creativity.”"
weedperson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-hydro-og/reviews/1356661,"“A rare gem!

Straight up tastiest, smoothest and just overall dankest bud I've had the pleasure of sampling.

There should be more stars for this strain.”"
