Blue Dynamite
=============
Dryland2012,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-dynamite/reviews/1355729,"“This strain is a nice tasting blue, so long as you DO NOT grind it up! The flavor is definitely preserved in its tightly packed nugs. It made me feel uplifted, peppy, and ready for adventure/tasks, even after a full day's work. I would definitely recommend smoking this on the go, in a pipe :)”"

Leave you with a nice warm fuzzy feeling throughout your entire body. Definitely one of my new favorites”"
Ayanme,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-dynamite/reviews/1346650,"“An Afgani X Blueberry 
Seems to look light blue with lots of densely packed crystals.

Nice easy high. Good for pain management, relaxation, enjoying a light meal or a gentle walk. May make users dizzy as it has more body feels but some pressure in the head may occur.”"
Gnomenads,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-dynamite/reviews/1218597,"“This strain removed all pain and stress. I have a herniated disc in my lower back from a car accident three years ago and this strain squashes that pain. 

This strain also has a great high. Very relaxed, super euphoric, not too distracting. I found myself able to do what I needed to throughout the day. Highly recommend it!”"

luftmenshca,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-dynamite/reviews/1308500,"“I am pretty pleased I tried this strain. It's a fairly mellow cerebral high, I feel very clear headed when I vape this, which is great. It keeps me calm and offers a nice body high, but without much couch lock at all. Does give me pretty intense munchies, but if I ignore the cravings everything else is peachy. Really great for sleeping, too!”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-dynamite/reviews/1174887,"“Blue Dynamite is a Grade A cross between Afghani and Blueberry, witha light blue tint. It has a slightly fruity taste with a good body effect. It is a strong indica with about 24% THC content.”"
TK007,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-dynamite/reviews/1268411,"“Smooth smoke.  The batch I had was very pungent. Great flavors too. I felt the effects before I finished my L. Made for an interesting viewing of Game 3 between the Raptors and Heat.”"

Wonderful relaxed body buzz, but with a surprising and uplifting cerebral stimulation . The flavor was amazing, and it worked great for relaxing into bed. A must try !”"

Goldenspruce,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-dynamite/reviews/1471349,"“Rewind ten years ago. This took tokers of Vancity to a whole new place when it first arrived. The smell of diesel mixed with an earthy nose was unique and powerful. The smoke was fast acting with a wave of calm while still clear minded... and the cake.. oh the cake! Sticky pungent frosty blue weed. I forgot about this beautiful strain until I just found it on the Phat site. Cheers!”"

AaronOdiwuor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-dynamite/reviews/1254381,"“I purchased Blue Dynamite to experience the effects of a high CBD strain; bud looks wonderful and smells great, but has a dizzying effect without much euphoria. This isn't a flower I’d choose for recreation; however it's wonderful for pain relief and can be added to other strains, enhancing the overall experience. ***Blue Dynamite by Vashon Velvet, CBD 11.70%, THCA 4.98%, THC9 0.20%, Terpenes 1.23%, Cannabinoids 17.7...”"

rEDrEACTION,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-dynamite/reviews/1292282,"“Didn't get me as high as other blue dream crosses but it smelled and tasted good and effects from one bowl tended to last about 30-40 minutes.”"
popeglazier,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-dynamite/reviews/1321341,"“My impression of this batch of this strain is that it is good, but not great. I would have been happy with it in the bad old days before I got my card and had so many beautiful strains to choose from. Like I said good, but nothing that special”"
Path78,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-dynamite/reviews/1329468,"“Blue Dynamite is a high CBD Indica, with a very pleasant berry flavor, and sweet aromas.

I have really come to enjoy Indicas which do a great job helping me stay asleep, something I have trouble with partially due to physical pain and in part due to a wandering, restless mind. 

BD was quite good at putting both in check. It certainly had a compound effect, as the first 2 hits were relaxing and slightly hazy, but be...”"

Pain relief and nausea relief were the main benefits I experienced from this strain. At some point, I experienced several waves of paranoia—something that I do not experience too frequently.”"

The effects are completely different than a THC strain and quite enjoyable. Definitely add this to additional strains as a salad. But on its own it is very pleasant. Flavor is nice as well. Top notch product.”"
