elfas1994,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-skunk/reviews/1393503,"“Great and very powerful strain. Great at helping with insomnia and leaves you with a sutisfying taste after it is smoked. Great smell and prefferably consumed before you go to bed. Do not consume a big amount if your not an expirienced smoker!”"
JIMB06,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-skunk/reviews/1383180,"“This strain is above average. The affects are felt within minutes, and continue to increase for 30 min or so. I feel blissful and creative. Nice euphoria, yet no loss of short-term memory. Red eye symptom is very low. Smoked smooth. I took the dogs for a walk, and it was fantastic. The grass and trees were more vibrant, The fresh air smelled extra good...the cool breeze made me feel so alive and humble of the beauty ...”"

Pheonix22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-skunk/reviews/1383182,"“Quite a potent strain, the high should hit you already while you're smoking and to me - its definitely more Indica than Sativa. Its quite a hard hitting initial high and normally wears off after about an hour, its great if you want to sleep, or for use as an anti-depressant. It uplifts your mood, also promotes crazy munchies but otherwise it pleasant. The last batch I got was full of seeds, so i grabbed a few and pla...”"

Taste is AMAZING. 
Covered in tri
Almost immediate effect.
Great happy head high, uplifting and mentalbclarity.
This is more recreational of a strain. But great medicinal qualities if you suffer from depression.

Great strain, absolutely love it.
You can buy a quarter from purple lotus in SJ for 50 bucks!!!”"
jdsanto619,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-skunk/reviews/1192070,"“Fantastic strain, its sweet smooth taste made it a joy to smoke. The effects seemed somewhat delayed which had me a bit disappointed at first but when this "creeper" hit me...awesome. I felt very euphoric and was in a joyful mood for at least 3 hours after the joyful phase it seems to move into a more chilling phase but by no means a lazy mood. would recommend this to most experienced smokers out there and for novice...”"

irieminds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-skunk/reviews/1243565,"“I lived on Oahu for 4 years from 2011-2015 and Hawaiian Skunk is one of the best strains I've come across out there. Definitely the stickiest and strongest smelling strain I've ever come across in my life. The person who grew it outdoors in the Hawaiian soil is an awesome medicinal grower. A perfect hybrid offering the best of both worlds. Pain relieving, euphoric, and very Stoney. I was lucky to come across this str...”"
IndicaPeace,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-skunk/reviews/1230592,"“Not for the faint at heart. Hard body & to be inhaled with care and awareness. Middle grounder, so I waltzed with it that partied. Go in easy.”"
BurleyWDanielsII,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-skunk/reviews/1308795,"“I grew this strain for years, very uplifting energetic high. Found it perfect for daytime, especially on an outdoor adventure. Also an impressive cognitive stimulant.”"
medicalguy62,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-skunk/reviews/1318299,"“At a first glance the casual weed observer may hold a nug of Hawaiian Skunk, and notice it's impressive density, unusual for a sativa, and it's sprawling orange hairs. A closer look though, perhaps with a iPhone flashlight, will reveal rich crystals, covering the entire nug. I want to say it is relatively odorless compared to other strains, but a slight head cold has probably compromised the integrity of my olfactory...”"

poisonpink,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-skunk/reviews/1489071,"“This will start by making you feel really high and great, but I was not prepared for it to knock me out after. It had me falling asleep when I was not prepared to fall asleep.”"

LoungingPenguin93,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-skunk/reviews/1217842,"“This strain was an absolute creeper. Though my stuff was "bottom bag" material (smaller nugs, and some shake) it smelled very earthy, with a sweet hint of a fruit. It starts off in the head and uplifts your spirits before working its way down to relaxation. Perfect for beginners and pros! 👍”"

HerbeHeureuse,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-skunk/reviews/1274762,"“Hawaiian Skunk - my first vape cartridge! As of yesterday Oregonian recreational users can buy concentrates.  The budtender said that Hawaiian Skunk tasted phenomenal, and boy was she right! Mine tested at 65.91% THC and 1.30% CBD and it tasted like a fruit punch jolly rancher! DELICIOUS, like candy! I'm already sold on vaping with cartridges over smoking flower. This is much stronger than flower, but cleaner, no ash...”"
