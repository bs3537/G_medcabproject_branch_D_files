Critical Jack
=============
JDukart13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1397328,"“This is by far my favorite strain ever! Totally relaxed my body but did not put me to sleep. I only smoked 1 joint with my lady while listening to some chill music and just felt overall amazing. I wasn't giggly or trippin or anything, I was just myself but a much more nonchalant version. Highly recommend this!”"
infinidro,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1391860,"“Nice addition to an afternoon walk. Very talkative strain, but leaves you clear-headed enough to think through mildly challenging tasks. Doesn't give you the sleepies after the high wears off, which is good. The flavor is nothing to write about, unfortunately. Would toke again!”"
Persimmon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1381129,"“Vaped some Critical Jack at night and ended up cleaning my room and sorting out things to keep and things to donate to Goodwill--something that I had been procrastinating for weeks. It imparted a clear-headed high that helped me make quick decisions without emotions getting in the way. 

It felt like it didn't last as long as some of the other strains, but maybe time just flew by faster since I was moving around and ...”"

It grew to a three foot giant football sized, single headed, resin encrusted gem! 
Two rips on a bong and bam! A fast felt heightened cerebral and body stone effects! A five out of five in my books!!!”"
ApricotHash,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1397330,"“This is a pretty damn hard strain. Hard in the sense of "hard hitting". After a couple of joints, next thing you know your eyes open and you are experiencing a whole view on life. I smoked this at the top of a three story parking complex. After a couple of Crj joints, I thought I was on top of a skyscraper in an entirely other country. Definitely a quality strain. Apologies if my review is a little wonky/hard to read...”"

HighInHelsinki,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1381128,"“My best days are not behind me! ..Err, I mean - great uplifting strain. Good for depression. Mostly sativa and I wouldn't have it near bedtime. I have tried the parent strains and you can tell specific effects of each. Still Jack rules here. If you like the classic Herer then this is a nice variation.”"
kitkat1987,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1384894,"“This strain is everything it promises and then some. As a person with chronic depression in always looking for the best euphoric high without a crash at the end of the high. Will be getting again”"
katherineaa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1381130,"“By far my favorite strain. I've never found something that makes me feel everything as listed and more. I feel focused and able to continue going about my day more productively with the help of critical jack. Every person I've shared it with can agree with me as well! I wish more dispensaries knew of critical jack because it's so hard to find, but so worth it when you do!”"
SK8.fallen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1132291,"“Some really potent stuff. Amazing from the first puff inhale extremly harsh. Started out as a really energetic high followed by a couch glueing indica effect that leaves me felling medicated. Would highly recomend.”"
aarvid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1384893,"“A fun cross I found at my local dispensary. Jack Herer is my favorite strain. So anything crossed with it usually makes me happy. This one didn't disappoint. It's a lively daytime high and fizzles on the top of your head for a few hours. 
If I could find it around here more, I'd definitely snatch some up.”"
magpulx720,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1337488,"“This has become my absolute favorite. Grown it 4 times and each time it gets better! The flavor and smell are so strong it's mind blowing. When I decide to fire up the Xbox I pack this first! It increases my senses 10 fold, which keeps me in my game! Only problem, I have nerve damage in my back and it does not help with pain. But the high is amazing!”"
yourfriend_nico,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1386342,"“Never ever pass up the chance at trying this strain! I got a gram to try then they ran out but I've held on to it for 2 weeks and use it when I want to focus on my art. the high is very cerebral but not in a stupifying way and I had this calm energy before I knew what I saw doing..I was composing again and producing beats left and right and I was just like "what it totally just like possessed me to bust out my synth ...”"

Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1384891,"“Not a strong aroma, but upon breaking it up to smoke, noticed a Pine and  herbal type scent.  Soon felt relaxed, but awake, with a smooth uplifting and happy vibe.  Feels like I can focus on a task, but turn around and take a quick nap if I wanted to.”"
hwagonblast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1484399,"“Hands down, my favorite strain to date. It’s such an uplifting, talkative, energetic high. It will have you wanting to go walk around Greenlake with a friend (stopping every once and a while to just sit on a bench and look out into the serene water). You’ll talk about grand ideas as well as the little things, all the while being able to fully articulate what you want to say.”"
MagicGeenie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1384892,"“This stuff is really some of the best weed you can get. I accidentally packed a fat bowl, and after just that one, I was toasted. I might add that im not a lightweight by any means, it usually takes me 3-4 bowls to get high, but this stuff had be baked after one. The flavor is damn good, it smells really good, and it won't let anyone down. Try it if you get a chance”"

However, all the terrific Jack Herer strengths, plus some added muscle! Great sativa outset, but a welcoming Hybrid relax as well. Jack the Ripper, Jack Frost, and now this Critical Jack! Love all 3! Better than I expected, and definitely a top shelf donation, Jack Herer, R.I.P., and ENJOY my friends!!”"
VJvalvenus420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-jack/reviews/1278269,"“First time I ever smoked this strain. As soon as I opened the bag, a very distinct smell filled my room up with a sweet and earthy scent.  The nugs were quite dense but not rock hard. Critical Jacks dark complexion is splashed with colors like purple, dark green and dark orange.  It's glistening trichomes are on the medium side but the taste is on point. I would gladly share this great strain of Critical Jack with my...”"

Effects are perfect for starting the day. Uplifted, alert, happy, focused, euphoric, and slightly energetic. Highly recommend for those with mild asthma or looking for an uppity strain without anxiety. I’d get it again.

It's stoney, it's super giggly and uplifting, and it makes me social, which means she can sit and babble at my fave and I even sort of enjoy it and pay attention. And laugh.
