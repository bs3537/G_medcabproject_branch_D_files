Cataract Kush
=============
Grenouille,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cataract-kush/reviews/1413604,"“Super dense buds, often with some purple/grey/blue coloration, thick stems and opaque, white trichomes. Smell is classic indica - earthy and dank with an animalic note, yet there's a strong sweet/minty/spicy aspect that seems to really carry. The vapor from this one is thick, sweet and permeating. Overall, very pleasant aroma though problematic if you're trying to keep the smell down. The buzz is fairly long-lasting ...”"

It has a sweet, grape-dominant flavor profile. While I consider myself a sativa-guy, I certainly appreciate a good indica for before bed or to have while kicking back with some friends. This is a strain that has a bit of a delay when it hits you, but when it does, it hits you hard. Your body slowly goes numb and at first it see...”"

This strain I acquired first in Arizona @ AZ Natural Selections (Excellent Dispensary BTW). purchased an oil cartridge. It was a distinct kind of earthy and a little pine. At first it was a mediocre kind of high. I proceeded to indulge in a little more. I feel honky dory. So I looked at the profile for it. Then. It creeped up on me. Suddenly I was confused and extremely euphoric and mellow. R...”"

I have muscle pain, deep vein pain, stomach issues and chronic nausea as well as anxiety and depression. This helped with all of these! It does take about 5 minutes to feel any sort of medication, but it lasts hours. My pain was almost gone and I could finally eat something after 2 days. Will be coming back to this one again.”"

mrbc605,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cataract-kush/reviews/1397946,"“This is one hell of a strain! Its high THC and high CBD levels make it pack a real, long lasting punch. Though it says hybrid, this is a heavy indica leaning strain. This strain has given me the most intense euphoria I've ever felt from weed, and I'm no novice smoker.
Being that its an indica, it knocks away all my pain. It also has a habit of initiating couch locks. Its a wonderful bed time strain, in my opinion.”"
