Sondoor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/american-beauty/reviews/1672918,"“This bud smells super fruity/tropical and kinda taste the same with green/dark green color, decked out and frozen in crystals. The experience is definitely indica high It works great an evening chill strain (got rid of a headache) and I could still be functional if required.”"
