I prefer mixing the high CBD strains with either a sativa or indica in order to decrease the psychoactive effects as I have a professional job. I've tried Pure Love by itself and mixed with Sweet Island Skunk and OG 18. I prefer the Pure Love by itself. However, it does make me feel a little ti...”"

It has been a slower grow, and takes patience, but the great effects along with the smell make it well worth the wait.   The effects are relaxing, and help a lot with sleep, and pain, and make you pretty hungry which helps a lot with my usual lack of appetite.  I give it an 9 out of 10 rating for...”"

Thors_Bud,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-love/reviews/1609315,"“After a year of experimenting with different strains for pain after having multiple spine surgeries, this may be the best strain I have ever used. My pain was nonexistent, my muscles were relaxed (but not jelly), and my mind was still sharp. I felt like my old self for the first time in a decade. I highly recommend for pain spasms, and inflammation.”"
JenDog77,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-love/reviews/1697028,"“This is probably the only strain I will give 5 stars ever.  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis.  This strain for me, helps joint pain, nausea, anxiety, gastro pain, and brain fog all in one.  It's hard to obtain strain sometimes.  The pain relief is so good you expect to get extremely high, but you don't.  It's not an intense head high and after an hour or two I can go about my day comfortable.  I will buy this in any form ...”"
TommyOG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-love/reviews/1552141,"“I have been searching for an indica that can have its full effects on me since I use cannabis daily - this strain put my body and mind at ease and I can feel my eyes start to get low, the pain and anxiety slips away after just one dab. Good strain will definitely get this again - best if used at night before bed- very strong ! Stay lifted”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-love/reviews/1788014,"“Overall Rating: 95%
Brand: Ilera
Form: Claims it's sauce, but is thick distillate
THC: ~79% and oddly 0%CBD

I picked this up in sauce form at my local dispensary, I usually buy the sauces to throw into an empty vape cartridge but this one was too thick so it went straight into my dab vape mod.

The taste is an earthy sweet deliciousness you have to try for yourself to understand.

The effects last for hours, after a...”"

JeffBarry,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-love/reviews/1765704,"“This is by FAR my favorite strain! I have Multiple Sclerosis and this one by far is my all day everyday choice! I like to mix it with XJ-13 especially when the Pure Love tests out with a higher THC content. 
Since finding this great strain my daily intake of RX muscle relaxer has dropped from 60mg daily to 10mg tops! This is a must have strain for body pain and functionality!”"
ShireFeet234,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-love/reviews/1789378,"“Nice mellow strain. Relaxing, and good for evening use. Helps pain. Sleep was nice and easy. Bright and smiling. Loads of euphoria and laughs. Very nice.”"
Lili3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pure-love/reviews/1746438,"“I have pure Love for this strain. I finally found something that makes me feel happy and carefree. I’ve been smoking it all day and feel great! I suffer from chronic intractable migraines, tmj, anxiety, dissociation. My pain is gone, my jaw isn’t clenched, I feel so grounded after a horrible few months of increasing dissociation. I can smoke all day and not feel super stoned, just relaxed and happy. It doesn’t make m...”"
