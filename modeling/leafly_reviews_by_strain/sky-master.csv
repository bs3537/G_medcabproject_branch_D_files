Mellow, happy- bought this from researching strains, 's on the A list !”"

I searched my nearest dispensaries for either Blue Dream or Master Kush, since they are said to have the type of high I was looking for. Couldn't find either one in stock at my usual places, so I took a chance on this hybrid of the two.

I'm a moderate to heavy user (every other night or every third night...”"
