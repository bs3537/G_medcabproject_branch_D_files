LexyReviews,https://www.leafly.com/indica/monster-cookies/reviews/1394058,"“This strain is a real hard hitter. I feel so relaxed and calm. Music is good for this strain. I'm not sleepy at all which is great. I don't get hungry either. I have a chronic anxiety disorder when I am alone. I don't feel lonely at all! Playing on my phone is so entertaining which gets my mind off of it :)”"
Gorehill,https://www.leafly.com/indica/monster-cookies/reviews/1396412,"“Copped an 8th of this from Peace in Medicine in Sebastopol, CA. Big, nice nugs and the smell was crazy. This is some potent medicine so watch where you open it up. Any room or enclosed space will soon be smelling incredibly dankey.

This strain put's you at ease, alleviates your stress, anxiety, and helps treat your insomnia. This strain will give you the rest you need and the body relief your seeking. Very effective. I only do Indicas for insomnia and this has been one of the best Indica strains I ever tried. Sweet smell, sweet taste, highly effective.”"

It took my headache away and made me sleepy as I started to come down. As for the taste, it was excellent. A mix of sweet citrus and the fresh taste of fresh herbs 😉”"
demis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/monster-cookies/reviews/1160115,"“A very good strain, the buds tend to be very small yet dense and super sticky. I still Prefer the real cookies over this strain, yet still a very strong strain.  I'm a heavy indica mostly smoker, so this is more of a day time smoke for me. If your not an indica fan stay away! If you are I give 4/5. Made me hungry as hell (lol)”"

So while at The Cafe Liv in Ann Arbor, MI I seen among their vast and impressive selection of superb herb there was a jar of Monster Cookies. As I write this review I'm feeling real chill and the buzz is steady. Still functional and aware. The taste I would say is semi-spicy and "herbish" with a nice after taste. Definitely a great discovery and now among my favorites.”"

While using this strain, everything seemed very humorous and for a fraction of my high, I was extremely aroused, but that faded very quickly as well.
All around, this is an excellent strain to smoke if you're out with friends and not try...”"

A cross between two already amazing strains, and now you get the best of both worlds. You get the indica feeling through a very relaxing and euphoric body high and then the sativa effects in the head where it feels like its being massaged. This strain also makes you feel overwhelmingly filled with joy.”"
