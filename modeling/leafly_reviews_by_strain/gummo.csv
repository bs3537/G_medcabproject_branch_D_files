And the taste of gum that has lost its flavor.🤷That being said a very BEAUTIFUL bud as usual.. way to go Gabe and Co. This girl has my attention for sure!! Please right about this plant peeps I would love to compare notes. I'm buying another 2g and Sunny-D is delicious.👍✌”"

I hate to shamelessly plug a brand, BUT, I’ll be damned if anything I get from Freddy’s Fuego isn’t the best thing I’ve ever smoked.  I don’t like their price point, but I hate to say it just might be worth it. 
First I had Freddy’s Kush, straight fire.  Then I tried blueberry shortcake, sweet tasty fire.  That one might be my favorite. 
Now I partake of the amazing Gummo by Freddy’s...   ...”"

Talk about top-notch medicine :) For me, it's a fairly light high, as in high levels of functioning is still possible due to a clear head. In fact, this strain made me feel incredibly focused (eg. I had an amazing 2-hour conversation that I was more focused in and attentive to the other person and their emotions than I have been able to be ...”"

Sort of snug & safe feeling: like being safe in a fire-lit cabin during a rainstorm. Just very peaceful and calm. Also, I find the strain I got to be very umami-flavored. The smoke tastes like steak to me, a little.”"

The taste is tart orange. The effects are designed for me. Euphoria without jitters. My CNS melted into my bones and my mind was at ease as thoughts decreased. Highly recommend for anytime use and being social. I will definitely get again.”"
Cbarenbo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummo/reviews/1650807,"“Horrible strain. Makes me sad to write this particular review since I actively smoke every type of Gabriel strain on the block but this strain is horrible. I even smoked it with 10 people and every single person had the same effects. Gives you horrible spins and paranoia but I have to say that the spins are probably the worst I’ve ever experienced with a strain before. If you’re looking for the positives of this part...”"

skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummo/reviews/1676706,"“I've had Freddy's and Gabriel's Gummo, and Freddy's is much, much better. More relaxing, a nice, cozy, relaxing strain. Think... sitting on a beach with a cocktail, and getting a little sleepy in the sun. Could you get up and swim if you wanted to? Sure! Could you take a little nap? Sure! It's nice, versatile, and so orangey tasting. Really really nice.”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummo/reviews/1595754,"“No idea what "juxtaposed" is like in the description for this strain, but this is an interesting mix
 You feel the sativa side of blue dot and the indica side of bubble gum.

It's a solid 4 star strain”"
LunaDraconis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummo/reviews/1639502,"“For me, the high was slow to hit: approximately an hour before I felt much of anything. After it hit, though, it was absolutely marvelous. I had a hard time concentrating enough to watch a TV show and follow the plot, but this was a pleasant thing for me, as part of my anxiety is that it keeps an endless babble going in the back of my mind. The downside (not entirely unpleasant and minor, in my opinion) of this strai...”"
Defro81,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummo/reviews/1598905,"“I find the reviews a little surprising because I don't find this strain to be heavy at all.  This is a great daytime strain for someone like me, I can keep up with my chores and focus on all the tasks I need to do, I found it very uplifting.  I smoked a bowl and then was focused enough to cook breakfast and do the dishes and basically do all the things... it is nice.  I also didn't have a heavy dry mouth or get the m...”"

Whodat105,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummo/reviews/1603460,"“Surprised it hit so quick. 5 minutes after all my joints released and my neck cracked so loud I thought it broke lol. Sinuses did feel like they tightened up but worked out good because it cleared out my stuffy head. Definitely a go-to after a long hard day and needing to unwind.”"
