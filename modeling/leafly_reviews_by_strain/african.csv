African
=============
spacejunkOG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/african/reviews/1413765,"“"African" is being used here as a blanket term for "all African landrace strains."  That includes Durban Poison, Malawi Gold, Swazi Gold, Congolese, Kilimanjaro (Kenya landrace), Mozambika, Swazi Redbeard, Ethiopian, Kwazulu (SA), Zamal, Angola Gold, and countless others.  Unless you yourself have smoked any of these strains and they were grown and cured properly, you probably don't know what the African continent ha...”"
Herbalmagician,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/african/reviews/1414294,"“Review for Zamaldelica [Zamal x Golden Tiger (Malawi x Meao Thai)]:
This 100% sativa strain is pure adventure fuel! By a long shot, this is the clearest, most uplifting weed I've ever smoked - far more than Durban Poison, Hazes, Kali Mist or any other sativa strains I've tried. It imparts a happy, clear, truly get up and go feel that is perfect for activity and alleviating depression. The buds are thin, wispy, and ai...”"

I love my Kenyan bush weed it is everything you said a totally different state of mind and can be a bit overwhelming at times. I am a California Resident now and have been a would love to see more landrace strains. As you said hybrid genetics are making there way to fields across the world everyday and altering natural...”"

Very very good strains from Swaziland & South Eastern parts. Indica like is also to be had, like some reviews state some of herb to be found is real rubish mostly sativa crap.

magudu,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/african/reviews/1740017,"“Though now back in my California home, I spent nearly 40 years in Africa.  And as a regular user for much of that time, I guess I'm an expert of a sort on African weed.  I may even have had an influence on at least regional genetics, as I regularly sent seed from a variety of African venues to a good friend in Humboldt County throughout the 70s.

Africa is a really big place, and even still there are large remote are...”"
grolabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/african/reviews/1671534,"“Like other reviews...African Strain is a blanket term here.  I am born and raised in South Africa and at 33y/o i have smoked some of my countries best.
Swazi Gold like someone else mentioned was actually used to refer to the Hash we used to get, and there used to be a gold or red stamp burned into the hash brick to indicate red = medium and gold = premium.   Swazi Gold or Swazi Red.
I actually still have original Swa...”"

After a few minutes I started to feel the high slowly kicking in and its a quite nice feeling nit overwhelming.
I would say that it smells and tastes like Africa, a but earthy, its really nice.
I picked up different times and the colour changed a bit but it was always quite brown and dry but not harsh for the throat, its really smooth.

CrizpyNugz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/african/reviews/1328388,"“The most impressive part of a Kenyan strain was the amount of crystals on the flower. It actually looked like a geode in the random crevices of the bud. I concentrated some BHO from it, and the crystals were sparkling in the wax, after the butane evaporated, and it was chilling in my silicon tray.
The concentrate is awesome, and it has a strong flavor of garlic to me, and a hint of a black pepper taste. It gives me a...”"
