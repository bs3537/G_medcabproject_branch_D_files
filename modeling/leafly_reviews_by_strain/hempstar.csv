PlasmaWaffle,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hempstar/reviews/1328163,"“This strain smells like fresh citrusy lemons growing in a rain forest. Once it's ground, it smells like a blast of tropical citrus that tinges the nostrils. It was so enticing that I literally accidentally snorted a little bit because I couldn't get enough of the smell.

An inviting frosty layer coats the whole nug.  Pungent earthy tones are what I'm getting and there's an underlying scent I can't put my finger on...it's an herbal almost basil-ish smell.

The bust is mediocre but the vapour is thick and smooth giving an earthy taste.

The effects are nice and strong and motivate...”"
