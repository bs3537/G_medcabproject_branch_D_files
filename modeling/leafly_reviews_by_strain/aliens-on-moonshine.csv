The stuff grown by Cascade Gnome here in WA could be my all-around favorite flower ever in over 20 years. Just perfectly balanced, not trippy, overflowing with terpenes from every direction. Not a heady high but not just a heavy indica sink either. You can certainly get quite a effect going but it takes more of this than many other, and that's good in my o...”"
dabchildx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1466901,"“I suffer from multiple chronic illnesses that cause widespread pain, extreme nausea and vomiting. This strain in oil form (have not tried the flower) has become a staple in my daily life. It makes getting out of bed easier and helps keep my nausea and vomiting to a minimum. I am tube fed and with the help of this strain I have been able to eat small amounts of certain foods which is absolutely amazing. Highly recomme...”"
byangas,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1417568,"“This is one of the best tasting straings I have ever smoked. It has a buttery, oaky finish that lingers for a long time. My mouth has this buttery taste after smoking that is amazing. Adding this with some tobacco and having a nice spliff makes this my new favorite way to smoke. The high CBD and low THC make it a perfect chill smoke, and doesn't leave you with couch lock, or scrambled brains. An absolutely perfect da...”"
GoingGalactic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1536796,"“I've been focusing on one new strain each month, and today I picked this up. I'm fairly new to the plant (about a year) and I've intentionally sought after the balloon-headed, buzzy high THC strains because for me, they were the most interesting over all. That being said, it would make sense why I've been avoiding high CBD strains. 

A few major life events in the last couple weeks have really been distracting me and...”"
NoStop82,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1431861,"“Excellent flavor. Nice high that is more body relaxing. 
It works well on pain and inflammation. This strain is a little weak if you're looking to feel super high. If you're using it for the CBD benefits, you will not be disappointed. Inflammation went down a little bit. Pain was dulled and made the pain a bit less terrible”"
QuinGold,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1554461,"“This is a great CBD strain for newbies who don’t mind a little psychoactive effect, however there is definitely enough there for a seasoned person to still enjoy this strain.
I get mine in vape cart format from from Spokane Green Leaf, produced by SPP. 
I prefer vaping flower, but cartridges are nice for low key use. 
The cartridge seems to be glass with a metal mouthpiece and the oil is very light and clear.
If I va...”"
Crunchymomm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1482848,"“This bud is full of terpenes. The citrus scent of it is very strong, reminded me specifically of grapefruit. It could be a good day choice because it leaves you still clear headed. Definitely gives a soothing and relaxed feeling without incapacitating. Bit of a creeper. Didn’t quite kill pain as much as I would have liked but great for stomach problems or cramps. Can make you a bit dizzy. Will choose this strain agai...”"
sirbryan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1383166,"“It does the job quite well just a little stronger and would be fantastic”"
mattykins,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1433876,"“I am a huge fan of high CBD strains just for the fact that I can actually consume without overdoing it. This strain from Origins was low in prince and did a great job getting me where I needed to be.”"
cammo923,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1411038,"“This is a pretty good one. Strong dry mouth, and such, but will really take  you far”"
MiekleTexasRanger,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1682029,"“Have it in a cartridge, my favorite CBD strain currently, just the right ratio of thc to cbd, and you get that nice indica body buzz, perfect for any time :)”"
Heidiho68,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1415617,"“It does the job. How ever I still need something more potent?? Suggestions? AC/Dc seemed better for me.”"
ThinnamenThwirl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1688128,"“probably my favorite out of all of my preferred strains. I feel like I can get a lot done and enjoy every minute of it. Definitely makes me uplifted and that feeling just gets me going for some reason. Very low negative effects such as cottonmouth. amazing strain if you have a lot going on and you still want to take the edge off.”"
trite,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1784880,"“I bought this strain as a "that looks interesting" impulse buy and I will now buy it immediately if I see it anywhere. I have a lot of pain/nerve issues that I deal with, and am also very sensitive to THC (great if I want to sleep, not so great if I want to do anything else). This my go-to daytime strain. Keeps me functional, and a little elevated, throughout the day and almost erases my pain.

If you need some dayti...”"
Bonecleaver,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1506968,"“Awesome for pain! Very little couch lock. Great day time pain relief with very little if an feeling of being high.”"
S4ltKing,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1506774,"“As someone who doesn't want to get floored all of the time, this is a rad strain. It's relaxing and slowly helps to diminish the stress throughout the day. My mood was noticeably better as well.
The head buzz, although slight, was there. I recommend this to anyone who needs a little lift and has stuff to do.”"
Knappy2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1622380,"“CBD/THC IS 5:1”"
Zombie76,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1458832,"“Perfect cbd strain with indica effect. My sample was a dubble delicious cartridge. I am excited to try the flower.”"
ynotwbc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1736929,"“I just picked this up. Smoked two Js and didn’t really feel anything. I thought it was just really bum weed. Just looked here on Leafly and noticed I am locked into the couch as I’m reading the reviews. I love how informative this app is. Turns out it’s a high CBD strain and not a strain that really gets you stoned or high. Amazing info and now I love the strain because I’m more informed on its benefits! Eyes are now...”"
Greene_Faerie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1596326,"“Very Nice Strain! It’s very smooth not harsh as some other CBD I’ve had. I would totally recommend for new beginners!”"
icantbelieveitslegal,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1458086,"“I really like this strain, for the reasons others have mentioned: nice chill feeling, not incapacitating, relaxed, happy, and the Cascade Gnome is tasty and tight-budded- though they were generous with the stems the last time I got some. I like help with depression, help with enjoying getting some things done, but not going SuperScrub. I agree with others, it isn't strong enough for the head high I want for recreatio...”"
grunzerella,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aliens-on-moonshine/reviews/1659698,"“this strain smelled sweet with heavy lemon and diesel to me. I had Cascade Gnome. The smoke was fairly smooth, and the flavor was all lemon on the intake, and diesel afterward. The high was light from the THC, and the CBD was relaxing and yet creative. I could see this being a great post-stressful day I-need-a-minute-smoke.”"
