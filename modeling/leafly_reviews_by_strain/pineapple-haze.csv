Pineapple Haze🍍🍭 is by far the best I have come across. Not only does this strain hold true to it's taste of tropical fruit and smell of candy ( I swear I feel like I am eating a mouthful of Smarties Sweet tarts🍬, y'all remember those? ) 

The effects are excellent. Super focused, euphoric, creative. There was no weird tweaky sensation you tend to get...”"
John18,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-haze/reviews/1395922,"“I'm looking at a 1/2 ounce of Pineapple Haze and it's a beautiful sight. There are three exceptionally large buds in the batch, which I've stashed away in a humidor, at between 68 and 72 percent humidity, as per the hygrometer.
The buds are incredibly sticky and very, very pungent, with a whiff of pineapple, but mainly an overwhelming flowery, almost perfume like aroma that is filling the room.  Don't try and sneak t...”"
voice918,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-haze/reviews/1415007,"“New favorite strain. Delicious pineapple smell and taste. Soft, gritty buds (bought in SoCal). 
All my favorite things about Sativas are present in this herb. Euphoric yet clear headed, stimulated yet relaxed, happy yet aware.  Perfect for creative types with ADD.

I didn't mind spending a bit more. Pineapple haze is all that I wanted this week.”"

Whether you have to go to college, work or you want to spend your day off to be creative. 
It has a soft, round and sweet scent. It doesn't harshly shoots up your nostrils in a way other strains do. Rather, the fruity scent lovingly drifts its way up, to...”"

The nugs weren't as yellow as some of the other pineapples I've tried such golden pineapple but that tropical citrus aroma was definitely there and the nugs were very fresh and dank. The burn had an immediate taste of that tropical citrusy goodness that actually made the intensity of the burn a little easier to handle cu...”"

A couple things you should know before reading this -
I get real trippy at night most the time I smoke marijuana.
My eyes normally get unusually dry and red
It normally hits me pretty instantly.

Day 1.
So me and a good few friends went 5-5 each on 2 of these bags, so we had a 5 each basically. Now I had decided before smo...”"

commiegirl420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-haze/reviews/1385790,"“I was expecting great things since I love Lemon Haze so much, but honestly my experiences with this strain have been nothing but unpleasant. I felt extremely dissociated in a not-so-fun way and had a lot of muscle weakness and was just very uncomfortable in general, feeling agitated but detached and like I was going to pass out. It wasn't a downer, didn't put me to sleep or give me couch lock by any means, but it was...”"
