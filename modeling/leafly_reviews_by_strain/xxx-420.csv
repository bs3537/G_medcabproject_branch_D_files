I got the Concentrate, the CO2 Vaporizer Cartridge so it is a lot different than smoking the flower. if you have not tried one of the Vape Cartridge's I suggest you go try one NOW! They have them and other strains in the Vape Cartridges as well all at Miller's Marijuana in Porter Wa right by Elma.”"
