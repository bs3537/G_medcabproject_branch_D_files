These are some of the things I was thinking while high on this nectar of the gods while sitting at home.  I kept thinking I was melting into my leather recliner and had to keep pushing myself up to keep from falling but my arms weren't working.  I ended up grabbing my broom and layed it across my lap so the stick was laying over the arms where I...”"
crazycolton55,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-moon-rocks/reviews/1416579,"“This hybrid has an entirely indica based high, making you feel like passing out in seconds. It will make you feel like your on another planet, a planet with more gravitational pull making you feel heavy.  The flavor is a sweet skunk taste with a little aftertaste hint of berry. unbelievably good 4.5/5”"
BDco43,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-moon-rocks/reviews/1411985,"“Highly recommend blue moon rocks for its sweet, flowery, blueberry-fruity aroma and taste, and it's extremely relaxing high. All anxiety is soothed and happiness becomes intense after using BMR. Cannot go wrong with this heavily indica strain.”"

hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-moon-rocks/reviews/1370158,"“This is indica dominant? Really... to me it seemed a lot more sativa dominant. The mind high was incredible and happy. While I didn't really feel like being active, I didn't feel the heavy body effects either.

Over all a quite good flower and I would not hesitate to try this again.”"
jonathanG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-moon-rocks/reviews/1338110,"“(Blueberry indica x haze) x (afghani kush) paired with BOG's Bubblegum.  Fruity, sweet and refreshing it smells like sweet blueberries and chewing gum.  My batch was lab rated at 29% thc and .30 cbd.  High is ethereal and approachable.  Kind of electric and slushy.  Classy buzz and nice flavor I would recommend this.”"
StarCrow00e,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-moon-rocks/reviews/1360815,"“A complete body high. I felt like I was sinking into my bed. I was really happy to find that even though I had the body high I was not too sleepy. Instead I found myself laughing and making jokes.”"

generalattorney,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-moon-rocks/reviews/1362917,"“This shit is incredible. It's not your average strain but rather a combination of buds dipped in hash (oil?) and then dipped thoroughly in keef. What you get is a heavy hitting, out of this world high  -that is guaranteed to stone you no 
matter what your tolerance level may be. That said get ready to shell out 2x,3x or 5x”"

I bought some of this strain yesterday, and I find it to be quite potent, as others said! First I took one bong hit and waited a few minutes to see what effects emerged after one hit. I may not have waited long enough before walking out of the house with my dog, to take her for her walk. By the time we had walked 1/4 mile to the park, I wa...”"
