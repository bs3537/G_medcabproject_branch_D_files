Rolls Choice
=============
surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1385615,"‚ÄúBingo!

Gastrointestinal disorder nuked by this powerful crossbomb!
Pungent deisel and chemical flavors drive this strains deep taste profile. Users beware because over dosing will definitely sit you down and open slumbers gate. Extreme medical values! Give this sucker a try if pain relief is what you seek.‚Äù"
ROMELOVESBUDS,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1395858,"‚ÄúStraight GAS! Really enjoyed it. Good for pain and insomnia.‚Äù"
damoneht,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1372876,"‚ÄúThe perfect balance between euphoria and a heavy stone. Nice pungent and sour, light neon green, oily nugs. The real good stuff. It's got that classic OG citrus gas aroma with a sour funk that reminds me of bad breath and rotting meat. Potent and balanced from my experience.‚Äù"
mehpersonguy0,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1395859,"‚ÄúI usually prefer indicas, so I thought this would be a nice hybrid to get a good mix of both. Bright green, snowy like a white christmas, and nice fluffy buds. The smell and taste is heavily citrus/gas-y with a hint of pine- I love it. My headaches and neck pain melted away with a very uplifting head high and a mild couch-lock. Will definitely have to make the trip to HWC more often :3‚Äù"
Prairie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1382067,"‚ÄúI'm adding Rolls Choice to my list of favorites because it is the most effective strain for abdominal pain I've ever tried.  Relief is immediate and dramatic.  Although it's a Sativa-dominant hybrid I find Roc gives me a body high and to me, it feels more like an Indica.  The high is potent, long-lasting.‚Äù"
qwic.williamz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1378431,"‚Äúit's some 5 star smoke if grown right‚Äù"
iitzMunchiiez,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1372875,"‚ÄúI purchased this strain from High Desert Healing. I am overall very pleased. It is definitely saliva dominant, smokes well and gives me the munchies. It tastes really good. Recommended for people with high tolerances.‚Äù"
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1387633,"‚ÄúLike it.  Relaxing but not a complete knockout.  Pleasant and mild.  Smells lemony when you break up the flower.  You know that feeling when your high but you still have things to do, mainly around the house.  The tasks become pleasant.  I got a lot done.‚Äù"
CannaCass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1372872,"‚ÄúThe effects are right on! I am happy and sleepy! Also very helpful with PMS lol especially cramps!üíï‚Äù"
brightgreenie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1442124,"‚ÄúRolls Choice is my number one. It's my absolute favorite flower strain. WOW. So I first tried this strain on 4/20, and I've been thinking about it ever since. It is incredibly strong smelling, nearly impossible to hide. The high is magical. I feel very calm emotionally, content, and happy. I feel inspired and like there's so much hope... in the world. I don't know, it makes me feel strong and optimistic and totally f...‚Äù"
Comptonasstodd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1372874,"‚Äúone of the best i have ever smoked mine was at a whopping 26% and i got it free for my bday shout out to purple med in tucson !# tasted like god would choose this strain great for wake n bake or afternoon smoke a joint at night and itll put your lights out to great satrain! tasted like first time i tasted GOOD sour d im in love‚Äù"
92cody123,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1381683,"‚ÄúNice uplifting strain, makes you happy for no reason and a little giggly. I like this strain for doing anything outdoors. I tried this strain in crumble form and it tastes slightly woody and floral and a little pine. Good strain for depression and anxiety, might work ok for pain but there are better strains for pain management. Hope this helps, be safe.‚Äù"
Puff_Puff_Pass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1801165,"‚ÄúThis is in my top 3 strains of all time. Rolls Choice is a strain that I can't believe doesn't have more reviews. I affectionately refer to this strain as Rolls Royce, because it's that good.

Method - flower, smoked.

Taste - Incredible taste! Pungent, Skunky, Sour Diesel, Fuel, Pine Tree... It has all of the flavors that I truly love, all in one strain. While this is a complex taste profile, its flavors seem perfec...‚Äù"
Dastomba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1551153,"‚ÄúThis is very strong medication. Tested at over 28% THC and buds were covered in crystals. Effects are similar to SFV Dog but better pain relief. Not as mind numbing but better for pain. Doesn‚Äôt require a lot to get the job done. Enjoy!‚Äù"
carini77,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1716470,"‚ÄúSmell seeps through the area. Faint wafts of skunky goodness. Buds are dry and crunchy, but not turning to dust. Cure is okay. Definite piney lemony and a little diesel. Smoke is a tad harsh and chemically. Burns the lips and throat. High kicks in slow, I can see where people reporting the dizziness from. Smoked about 8 hits off my bat over 15 minutes. Solid stoney buzz no real couch lock, but so relaxing. Feeling me...‚Äù"
nycchicknphx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1479929,"‚ÄúThis strain is named so aptly named...its a great, solid, dependable, smoke with class. You'll feel like all pimped out, like you just stepped out if your boring ass life into a dimension where you are the star and nothing matters, especially pain and nausea. Why would you ever pass that up? Top notch.‚Äù"
Chelseasellsseashellsbytheseashore,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1372873,"‚ÄúGreat strain from great parents! Being a fan of Chemdawg AND OG 18, I really enjoyed how this strain played out. Good relief from stress, fatigue, depression, and PAIN! Nose reminds me of walking through a nice high end hotel room, out to the balcony overlooking say....San Diego?  With citrusyfloral/diesely/earthy goodness--yes, I'm saying it smells like the hotel California! Or at least A hotel in California--dig it...‚Äù"
fayewrey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1350458,"‚ÄúThis strain smells and tastes EXACTLY like the description in Leafly.

If you love sour and skunk, well enjoy the kick of pine, too! Excellent flavor and aroma ~ would be great in a candle...

Truly one of the best tasting strains, up against Super Sour and Private Reserve, which are among my local favorites!

I have hideous arthritis in my wrists, in my thumb/wrist area. This strain provided instant relaxation, espe...‚Äù"
flinds14,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1457299,"‚ÄúYou guys....holy crap. I've taken two pipe hits and I feel like I'm literally floating. I'm in this recliner camping chair, and it feels like I'm reclining...but I'm totally not! 

You HAVE to try this. I guarantee you'll love it. Plus, it's so freakin strong, it lasts a lot longer. Since you use way less, you go through it way slow!! 

10 out of 5 stars!‚Äù"
tpringle23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1381682,"‚ÄúHighly recommend this strain. I'm on week 3 of still smoking it. Great way to start your day before leaving the house for work. Try it if you haven't already.‚Äù"

Fourtwenty1970,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1561619,"‚ÄúWent to Nova and got this strain. Comes in at 28% THC! One of the best chronic pain relievers I've ever had. Very pungent smell and has an earthy, sweet taste. I would recommend this strain to anyone having chronic pain, gastro problems, and muscle spasms. This s**t works!! üòÄ‚Äù"
Titletown101,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1648857,"‚ÄúThis shit is amazing. I went from cleaning the house for no fucking reason to relaxing with a total body chill. Love this bud‚Äù"

weedx4,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1648281,"‚ÄúStoped by Emerald Phoenix in north phx yesterday & purchase a gram of this stuff it was everything but not what it says on Leafy. 15 minutes of daze and confused paranoid and not a good product later I was bummed, and didn‚Äôt get my much needed medicine. What are we going to do as patients if things like this keeps going on.‚Äù"
ClashRoll,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1538119,"‚ÄúThis strain is perfect for those like me who like to smoke small amounts throughout the day. Compared to some other sativa-hybrids, like Future or Verde Electric, the euphoric feeling is minimal and you get a little burst of energy and focus at first followed by nice relaxing high. Great for digestive pain as well.‚Äù"
samsfuzzychest,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1767622,"‚ÄúGeneral disposition: On and off bowls most of the evening. Ate a medium pizza. Feeling good, a little mentally slow.. Otherwise ok. I'll update this review later tomorrow starting off cold. 

Aparatus: Medium beaker of water with a single ice cube, and a two stage bowl. 

Smell: Kinda fruity!

First hit: Pretty typical, slight irritation. No dizziness or anything after five minutes. Throat drying a little.

Sonik13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1369917,"‚ÄúDefinitely a quality strain! Very fluffy soft nugs that hold a nice sweet diesel scent. The taste is very pleasant with a sweet pine taste while staying smooth to the smoke even for newer patients/smokers. Left me feeling awake after a long day of work.

I have trouble eating in the mornings so finding a strain that helps but does not totally knock ya out is great for me. Wish I would have tried it sooner.‚Äù"
Desertdove,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1379962,"‚ÄúThis strain is very energetic.  It gives me the pain control I need and the motivation to get up and still clean my house and other tasks.‚Äù"
Murdoch1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1425482,"‚ÄúNice bud for daytime use. Helps with pain while still allowing you to get things done.‚Äù"
Selsky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rolls-choice/reviews/1358541,"‚ÄúSo far, this is my favorite strain. I have severe anxiety so I have to be careful with what I smoke. Jack Herer made me super paranoid and anxious but this was a perfect strain. even though it's Sativa-domaniant, it's nice at night. The body part allows me to sink into bed will the head part let me share great thoughts with myself. I work very long hours in a kitchen and have joint pain and this melted all that away....‚Äù"
