It delievers a STRONG solid high... no need to smoke more than a couple puffs at once.  It's a great flower for hanging out with friends.. just don't smoke TOO much or you'll be on your ass.  I'm a sativa lover... this is kinda like a indica FYI 😊”"

For fans of "Gas" weed, Cirrus gives you a hard and clear OG Kush type of punch to the cerebrum upon inhale, and a dreamy  exhale of sweet purple tasting smoke. High is strong and functional. 

Flowers will be glittering with trichomes, revealing a spectrum of purple and green pastels.

I must say, this is among the best I have ever had.  Taste is very fuel forward with a somewhat sweet almost minty aftertaste.  The high is very strong but very pleasant.  It made me very giddy and talkative and lifted my mood considerably.  Made my eyes feel as if they were the size of grapefruits and like there was a fuzzy aura su...”"

This pheno emphasizes the Platinum GSC genetics nicely with a hard fuely OG kush type of punch to the cerebrum upon inhale, with a dreamy, candy-breathed exhale. Look for this strain on the top shelf!”"

A little goes a long way though... very heady effects that make it feel like your head is a balloon floating here and there, a bit trippy. Visuals can also get a bit trippy with light trails and an intense focus. But beware, smoke too much and you’re bound to experience an altered state of being that may be too overwhelming for newbie...”"
