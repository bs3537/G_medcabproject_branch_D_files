SG70sman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-dream/reviews/1385687,"“This was my first Top shelf strain, I did this when i had a very low tolerance. 

Max Dose: Insanely lucid high. It is literally surreal. Sounds are amplified and clear, everything looks super hd and sharp, watching the lion king was akin to a trip on psychedelic drugs.

When i heard about it i wondered if it would be better than just smoking what i already have. But when i had for myself i didn't regret it at all. What i looked at was a very frosty and sticky beautiful looking weed. This is a very enjoyable high that you want to have when you are just hanging out wit...”"

Copped a dub and cyphed two joints in my bathroom between 5 people. As soon as everyone had at least one hit, we all looked at each other at the same time and started cracking up because we were already high from ONE HIT. It was pretty crazy. Green Dream is a gem if you want to get insta-high and if you want to save money on bud...”"

Ryder1117,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-dream/reviews/1772954,"“This strain is a LEGIT sativa bottom line. Beautiful flower with strong aroma. I got home from work and my whole apartment smelled like beautiful flower. This strain hit me hard and had me ready for the day. Not a strain for nighttime. I personally like to have a couple different strains on hand, a good Indica dominant hybrid and then also a strong sativa on hand. Green dream was exactly what I needed for my Sativa s...”"

From my personal experience in great for headaches. Relaxing kind of buzz when smoked as flower. The texture and taste reminds me alot of OG style bud. Tasted sour.”"

I personally didn’t feel the energetic effects as much because it’s a hybrid but it’s a great deep thinking strain with a full body experience. I definitely felt a little dizzy, giggly, and I did get the munchies pretty bad lol.”"

This strain leaves me feeling slightly 'stoney' but not tired. and I only slept 4 hours last night! I feel mildly focused, but what I'm happier about is that it's pain relieving.

Back spasms were at an 8 and now they're a 4, I'm not glued to the couch, and I'm mildly focused. This is a generally good daytime smoke!

The strength feels lower than other strains like Tangie which f...”"

ARTailor8,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-dream/reviews/1343565,"“Very visually appealing flowers. Bright light green with visible, individual trichomes.

Smell: you immediately get the spiceiness of the Green Crack with the smooth, tropical aroma of Blue Dream. This settles into the floralness mixture of both of these component strains.

The taste: pure Green Crack with a Blue Dream background. Definitely notable Sativa component in the flavor (most pronounced flavor: nuttiness).
