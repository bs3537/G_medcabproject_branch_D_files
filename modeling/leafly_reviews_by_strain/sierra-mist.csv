Honestly smells just like the soda does, such lemon-limey goodness :) Didn't hurt my throat and tastes just like it smells from a clean bowl. I bought a zip for $180 from Patients in Mind in Sacramento (steal of a deal) and though it was a bit stemmy (hence the deal), it was definitely some fire top shelf. Posted a picture...”"

I never leave reviews or even brag about the bud I get... but this strand is F-ing incredible! gives you an amazing head high like a good sativa should but also relaxes your body like a good indica should. it's the best of both weed worlds. everybody needs to try it. okay gotta go, on my way to buy more ;)”"
