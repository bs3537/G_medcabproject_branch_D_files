That said, I feel this may be the most intense body high I've ever experienced. 20 minutes after smoking this you'll forget you have a physical presence. I'll be back for more of this...”"

amount of trichomes. Taste is good with a little expando action. A very steep but calming high, it seemed to make the world a bit sunnier.”"

After smoking you’ll have a about 25 minutes to get into a position you will most likely stay for the rest of the high. What I don’t like about this strain is the very dry mouth and eyes. Occasionally it also makes me paranoid.”"
