trumanmoth,https://www.leafly.com/indica/peyote-cookies/reviews/1416590,"“Took three hits to a light brown on the herb in the evening. Was feeling relaxed with good pain relief and my mind was at ease. Before bed I took two more hits to a dark brown on the herb and had some interesting experiences. Incredibly hallucinogenic as I was falling asleep, I had an experience where all of the sounds in my environment (fan, TV, running water) started to come together and it was as if I could feel t...”"

buddwyer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/peyote-cookies/reviews/1416589,"“This strain is a hard-hitting indica. Expect this strain to make your pain melt away and give you some red eyes. Definitely a night-time strain as this strain makes you very sleepy.”"

sargasso,https://www.leafly.com/indica/peyote-cookies/reviews/1734551,"“District Cookies (aka Peyote Cookies). THC = 20.2%. Rough cut in a King Palm mini. Smooth smoke. Fruity-ish central palette. 

Central head pressure into some mild paranoia. Was that a raccoon sneaking up behind me?  Depth perception faded and eye stutter like Amnesia Haze and then out of nowhere I was very aware of every face muscle which promptly froze. I was locked in. That was abrupt. Tried talking to the Mrs but...”"
R0CHI,https://www.leafly.com/indica/peyote-cookies/reviews/1646772,"“relajante pero a la vez voladora. una variedad con un excelente sabor y olor. Puede que a un peincipio no notes su efecto, pero al pasar los minutos notarás el cambio mental y corporal.”"

GoodyG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/peyote-cookies/reviews/1586129,"“She absolutely explodes when topped on the fifth true set of leaves; when turned to flower will stretch a good 200-300%. Needs less water than other Barney’s strains I have grown; and will show you she has wet feet fairly quickly. (Leaf tips drooping) very strong vigorous grower; easy easy strain to grow.”"

MagicLady,https://www.leafly.com/indica/peyote-cookies/reviews/1709945,"“I picked up this strain at one of my local dispensaries, looking to try a strong, psychedelic high and was told this was a great one to go with. Sadly, this is not what it delivered. Though it wasn't what I was looking for, it is a gentle, relaxing head high that doesn't bog you down or make you feel lazy and it's a smooth draw too. Whether it's in a joint, pipe, bubbler, or bong, you really can't go wrong with Peyot...”"

cumulus_crown,https://www.leafly.com/indica/peyote-cookies/reviews/1636114,"“All-time favorite sleepytime strain. Great, rich flavor that explodes in your chest and head instantly on contact, leaving tiny lightburts lingering all over everything.
I can hang all day/night with this smoke, but also have had some of the best sleep of my life with this strain! Love it for a nice headtrip through la-la-land on my way to slumberland. Only wish it were easier to get ahold of.”"

Jnmills,https://www.leafly.com/indica/peyote-cookies/reviews/1462244,"“Easy easy indoor grow in 30 gallon cloth pot under leds.  Covered in resin, and smells great.  Smooth smoke and takes great.  Good yield, not great, but will be growing again definitely.  Feels relaxed and happy, too much puts me to sleep.”"

I swear after trying over 30 strains throughout the past year tweaking my pain relief I’ve never found anything quite like peyote cookies.  I felt like I was back in the 80’s giggling like a fool LOL!!  
I hope this strain doesn’t dissipate now we’re legal in Canada!  It is by far the best pain r...”"

RonaldRegan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/peyote-cookies/reviews/1607431,"“I got this as a vape cartridge and boy, was it the best one I had. If you’re stressed out about job loss, a girl on the rag and hugging your nuts like a vise (or a man vise verse, it’s 2018 we don’t stereotype), or you just got too much shit on your plate that’s kicking your ass worse than a 10 year old beating you up at WrestleMania 34, here’s the shit. Hide somewhere where you can go, and light away on it. Soon, yo...”"
