Banana Kush
=============
SkyTripper,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1415181,"‚ÄúPicked up some Banana Kush the other day and WOW!
This lime green, nice-smelling bud just wasted me after about 4 good rips on a bowl.  The high creeps in after about 5 or 10 more minutes and left me all zoned out, like I was on a mild acid trip.  Hell, I've been tokin for 30 years too!
Old school bud for sure.
This bud puts a big smile on my face, left me talkative & sociable, tripped way out, seeing things, hear...‚Äù"
Gerzbermz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1415192,"‚ÄúGot this and some Sour D as my first two hits of medical during my first trip to a dispensary.  I've been smoking daily for the last six months, so I've built up a minimal tolerance.  I packed a bowl and after three hits I was gone.  I hadn't been that high off such a small amount in a while.

Gave me a short case of the munchies, but nothing I couldn't ignore.  I did find that sitting was a must, and lying down equa...‚Äù"

I suffer from  high anxiety, and depression,  ocd and who knows what else.  lol  So, I have been trying different blends.  I find that to high of a sativa I get anxiety and paranoia, and over think every single thing.  But if I do to high of an indica I then I am wiped out and tired.

animus303,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1390688,"‚ÄúThe Bananna Kush is a delicious cross of Banana and OG Kush. Believed to have originated in California, this indica domininant strain is one of the gentler OG's I've had. The banana certainly comes through, even in a pre-roll. While I found my appetite to be stimulated as well as my anxiety muted, at no point did I feel overwhelmingly tired or exhausted, making this a great day time indica.

iEatBeavers,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1380233,"‚ÄúExcellent strain. I've had the Banana Kush from VIP Cannabis on Federal and Alameda, and while I've got to say it's their best strain, that isn't saying much. I started going to Good Meds Lakewood and theirs is MUCH better.. (not just Banana Kush, ALL strains.)

weazal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1413986,"‚ÄúWhat a unique high!

The perfect combination of clear-mindedness and ease of concentration while simultaneously feeling really different/high. I felt motivated and didn't have couch lock (but that may have been from recent coffee).

The most noticeable effect: While my perception stayed coherent - not muddy or fuzzy - it felt like it slid sideways. As though you're experiencing life the way your uncle perceives it. R...‚Äù"
BDco43,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1380937,"‚ÄúPerhaps my experience as a worker in the Produce Department sets my review as biased right off the bat, but I love Banana Kush. It seriously smells like bananas, but the high is much more desired for than a yellow, dong-shaped fruit from Ecuador. This just may be the most relaxing strain I have ever indulged in. Perhaps due to the hybrid effects, it felt like an indica, but still had the mind high of a schizophrenic ...‚Äù"

I am so glad. it was like the stars aligned. I suffer with Lupus, RA, Anxiety, etc. I'm always worried about anxiety attacks with any strain, even if the strain "helps with anxiety" I will still have an attack.

Jyonna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1481724,"‚ÄúThis strand is amazing. Im usually on the quiet side and just let people talk as I enjoyed my high nodding in agreement to something I forgot I agreed to in the next 30 second but as soon as I hit this I couldn't stop talking . I was saying anything that came to mind and it made me a goofy philosopher as well. Relaxed in the hands and arms and very clear in the head. I like it. I think I'll buy it again for sure.‚Äù"

For Waxy Wednesday I treated myself to Select Strain's Elite Banana Kush, an indica dominant hybrid.  It tested at 89.6% THC (Whaaatt??) and .88% CBD. 

Banana Kush's parents are Ghost OG and Skunk Haze.  I thought it would taste more like bananas, but who knows the cartridge oil changes taste with age and use.  Right now in the beginning it tast...‚Äù"
MommaSinWolf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1378244,"‚ÄúThis particular version of banana kush is exactly what even the most hard to please patient would expect of something carrying this name.

In terms of plant structure, the flowers are dense, high calyx count and short node spacing, with a brilliant green color showing through all the swollen reason glands. It's almost as nice to look at as it is to smoke.

The flavor is excellent. The spicy, earthy flavor on the exha...‚Äù"

This strain is GREAT for patients with Schizophrenia and Anxiety disorders due to the fact of it's very low level of paranoia.

WOW......Banana Kush is it!

hockeyandbud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1353833,"‚ÄúI took 3 hits out of a gravity bong on this. Very good hybrid strain. It's great if you have just came home from school on a Friday and wanna have a fun, but quiet night in. I walked to cici's pizza and got lost so I called my friend and he gave me directions. Me and my best friend love this strain.‚Äù"

UncleAcid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1385718,"‚ÄúI tell you, I have searched high and low for a rather LONG time for this one particular strain. And as popular a strain as this is, I was surprised how long it took to locate. But when it showed up, it practically fell into my lap! Needless to say, I was stoked.

Banana Kush in small doses of oil are honesty amazing! I feel energetic in a warm way. I feel alert, creative, and motivated in my life.

carlitodopeman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1146241,"‚ÄúThis strain will get you high,  perhaps too high. The effects were mostly indica oriented. Great for relaxation and sleep.

Banana Kush is my favorite of the many kush varieties, and the word I'd use to most aptly describe it is "whole" - there is something rich and deep and whole about the buds, not thin, wispy smoke like some mid-level stuff that passes through you.

No noticeable "comedown".  You can smoke this all day and not get tired of it.  Felt really relaxed all day.  Had me in a great mood.  Productive despite my laziness and euphoria.  Good daytime, "doing-shit" strain.‚Äù"
bluntreviews,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1142979,"‚ÄúThe Banana Kush nugs are big ol' nuggets that smell like sweet bananas. It's like the nug is covered in sugar with the amount of trichomes all over it. Super dense and once ground up, the scent becomes even stronger and fruitier.

Telperion69,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1150264,"‚ÄúLoud smell. Doesn't taste like it smells.  Light banana-ish/earth tone flavors. Quite mild considering how loud it is. Had a cone between 2 and couldn't finish until after our hike. Buzz was very enjoyable, but didn't have legs.‚Äù"

MarysHusband,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1137309,"‚ÄúBanana Kush did not meet my expectations as far as Taste and Feeling. It didn't have a significant Banana Taste, very slight. The smooth Smoke m makes up for that partially. The High didn't last very long off of a gram in my Bowl. Whole it lasted the Body High want all the way there for me. And as although I'm not too crazy about Sativa Highs, it didn't prove itself to be an acceptable quality Sativa. I really liked ...‚Äù"
