Piney Cedar Taste
Cough Attack
Creeping euphoria to the head
Sets in slowly and
Ceases the physical pain of exercise
Feeling light as a feather
At heart

I felt the need to giggle, crack jokes. 
This combats stress while
Cerebral, opening up your mind up towards 
the universe around you
Inconspicuously

GreenPie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-widow/reviews/1414957,"‚ÄúDefinitely leans more on the Indica side for me, especially body-wise, which I like. When I was in the hospital recovering from surgery I had some canna peanut butter with White Widow and it helped with the pain way better than the pain meds they were giving me.

Ramoburo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-widow/reviews/1417141,"‚ÄúWhat can I say if this is my go to strain? It's a perfect mixture of indica and sativa that makes you enjoy the unexplored world of your dreams after a couple of big bong rips with a slightly bodyhigh. The only downside of this might be the earthy taste, I enjoy more the sweet taste what most sativa's have.‚Äù"
kantheist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-widow/reviews/1394036,"‚ÄúWhite Widow is a memorable strain for me, and not just because it was the first one I smoked. Even after years of daily smoking and vaporising, this strain's indica side still floors me.

It's scent and flavour are quite plain and natural, a simple earthen taste with a touch of wood.

I was loading the nug into the bong, and I took a rip out of it.. White Widow gave a spice, smooth tasting. It taste excellent, the high feels incredible. It gives you that happy, relaxed feeling. I also became energetic, then later you mellow out and it is amazing. Would definitely buy again!‚Äù"

It has an amazing smell, full of crystals, soft, and slightly sticky. The smoke itself is really smooth, out of a bubbler or pipe, and has a mellow taste. Effects can be felt between 5-10 mins, and last up to 1.5 hours. Uplifting, euphoric, and smiley high. Energy and creativeness are felt as well. A great social high that lives up to the hype.‚Äù"
