It was great for work purposes and kept me happy, bubbly, energetic, and smiling...

I had more fun after using Juliet than I'd had in a while.  It gave me energy, made me happy and I got my loooonnng list of chores done in no time!  I also just wanted to mess with my friends and be an instigator for fun.  I took no shit from anybody, yet gave them plenty in a friendly, non threatening or negative manner tha...”"

busyglide,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/juliet/reviews/1315274,"“First smoke was smooth and I immediately felt my eye tingle, I loved feeling super calm and my mind was surprisingly clear.  Towards the end, I got a little nauseous...that was the only bummer.”"
