savannah27,https://www.leafly.com/indica/early-girl/reviews/1413630,"“Early girl was the perfect strain to sit outside, listen to music, and drink sweet tea on a summer day with some friends. It tasted super sweet,  piney, and the high was exceptional. 5 out of 5 stars!”"
Nicane,https://www.leafly.com/indica/early-girl/reviews/1384394,"“Very decent bud overall. Takes a bit more than usual to get the high you want, and it's definitely shorter than most other strains, but it gets the job done for a price that can't be complained about. Nothing special, but definitely puts you in a lazy, ready for bed, sit down and enjoy movies and food type of mood.”"
RVigue,https://www.leafly.com/indica/early-girl/reviews/1384395,"“This Strain is an Awesome buy for the Quality and the "Effects" that are "Typically" experienced. My husband and I both tried this at the same time, and we both became Overwhelmingly Wildly Aroused and with a Funny, Giggly, Creative, Flexible, Energetic, and Happy!

The Flavor is Very Pleasantly Sweet and the Taste is Indescribably Wonderful!! I Highly Suggest you Give this Strain a shot, at the Very Least!”"

edd231,https://www.leafly.com/indica/early-girl/reviews/1213679,"“great strain to combat stress and to help unwind  after a tough day. Very aromatic, smelled of citrus fruits and a vanilla/sweet smell. Overall great strain, helped with minor pain and stress, no anxiety or paranoia. Like the highlight said a great strain for new comers, good for stress, nothing over the top.”"

Ruffle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/early-girl/reviews/1305260,"“Not amazing in terms of THC as its like 17%, but as far as how happy of a high it is, I think it tops all. If not it's definitely top 3. Long lasting happy high turns in to couch lock after about 30 minutes. Definitely good for stress relief. Early girl man....”"

blikatin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/early-girl/reviews/1364883,"“This stuff will get your really high, but will make you feel really depressed if you like sativas. It's a solid sleep aid, but it doesn't have a mellow come down and you really have to sleep it off. The biggest thing I don't like about it is that it makes me space out and get really slow”"
hotsauce9608,https://www.leafly.com/indica/early-girl/reviews/1226883,"“Very easy going strain. no paranoia, just a couple hits make you feel really calm and mellow without being tired. It definately wants to make you chill and just watch tv.”"

VUhighguy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/early-girl/reviews/1070167,"“Ive only encountered this strain once, but I loved it. It smelled faintly of chocolate and was probably one of the funnest highs Ive experienced. After smoking it me and my friends became very uplifted and would laugh uncontrollably about anything even slightly funny.”"

am302b,https://www.leafly.com/indica/early-girl/reviews/1355559,"“Very sticky feel. Has a sweet pine smell. The high is a 5/5.
5/5 for anxiety (fantastic strain to treat anxiety)
5/5 for relaxed 
3/5 for tired 
5/5 for energized (Gives you a high but doesn't make you want to sit around it's more of a active high)

All around I would say that Early Girl is a very good strain for someone looking to get the nice high but be able to go to work or go outside to do something.”"
