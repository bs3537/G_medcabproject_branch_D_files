Katsu Kush
=============
JRyanAlexander,https://www.leafly.com/indica/katsu-kush/reviews/1381039,"“One of my favorite strains, an Indica done right in AZ, I've seen rich purple hues and plenty of resin on their buds. I have always loved the sweet earthy scent of it, no doubt high in myrcene. I also know that in addition to high THC and strong showings of CBD, Katsu is naturally higher in CBN, prior to oxidation. A perfect strain for evenings and nights to relax the mind and sedate the body.”"

This tends to be more chocolately /coffee than the bubba that leans towards the OG, both being extremely earthy. Between the different varities im not entirely sure what is what, but i do know this is some killer smoke, most likely afghan. Most have hints of purple coloration. Starts behind the eyes and works...”"

Also acts as an antispasmodic, working from inside to help knock you out and keep you down. Make sure to be ready for sleep before consuming this strain. Worth seeking out for any fellow MSer.

I woke up and had some of that wax and completely forgot to take my prescription for painkillers because I felt ve...”"
