AdamWallLeafly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-fire/reviews/1350982,"“This one will really put your body at ease.. Starts with a very strong feeling all the way down to your fingertips. Can bring on tension in the head if you let it. Gotta stay on top of this one or the anxious will become just that. Strong, and a great smell.”"
