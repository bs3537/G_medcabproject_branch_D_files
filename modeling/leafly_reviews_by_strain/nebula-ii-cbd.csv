Nebula II CBD
=============
HappilyPainFree,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula-ii-cbd/reviews/1392921,"‚ÄúCalming, Honey, sweet smoke - the anti-anxiety effect of the high CBD is very noticeable. Also good for asthma and joint pain, muscle spasm/cramps due to its anti-inflammatory action. 

Clears my head pretty quick, a nice daytime use for pain, stress and spasms!‚Äù"

renaudobie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula-ii-cbd/reviews/1380542,"‚ÄúThis was my first high CBD strain - and I wasn't disappointed. I toke with a friend on a beautiful sunny day around noon. I somehow exprience difficulties concentratingon monday mornings, and I counted on it to help me get through my art history class. Right after I ashed the joint, it began with a mellow cerebral indica buzz, but around 10 minutes after I started feeling the sativa effects as well. I was uplifted an...‚Äù"

D3adlicious,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula-ii-cbd/reviews/1359018,"‚ÄúReally mellow high! Was smiling and laughing the whole time and instantly put in a great mood. I suffer from anxiety and panic disorder and have to be cautious as some strains increase or intensify my anxiety- but this strain was amazing at keeping me chill and thinking positive.  Only downside is that you end up with a minor headache but I just slept it off. Would highly recommend to everyone but as well to first ti...‚Äù"
deckmilit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula-ii-cbd/reviews/1359998,"‚ÄúVery good as a CDB medical strain. Will not give you too much psychoactive effects but has a reasonable amount of CBD. Depending on symptoms, you may need to consume a bit more but overall a positive strain.‚Äù"
MzTrillz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula-ii-cbd/reviews/1360918,"‚ÄúI love this strain better in a vape pen then smoking it straight. I feel its best for mixing with mild to high thc hybrid strains   for people whom have chronic pain and autoimmune diseases.‚Äù"

NicolSD,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula-ii-cbd/reviews/1293493,"‚ÄúWhile investigating something I could take during the day time, I came across this strain. It takes the pain away while keeping me focused. As an extra bonus, I barely get a buzz. That means I can still get some things done.‚Äù"
Riddlechip,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula-ii-cbd/reviews/1326180,"‚ÄúFelt this to be the less pleasant CBD strain I've had so far. Smell and flavour where both great but the high was less body and more so cerebral. No uplifting effects and didn't feel as relaxed as I usually would. This just wasn't right strain for me.‚Äù"
Naaman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula-ii-cbd/reviews/1329867,"‚ÄúGreat day time smoke or when you need to stay clear, nice taste, body focused.‚Äù"

PinkRanger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula-ii-cbd/reviews/1331274,"‚ÄúI bought 5 grams of this strain and to be honest im kinda dissappointed. I have tried the original . nebula before and i really like it. It made me focused, goal and task oriented; however this strain is really weak, not much of a high. I guessing there is someone out there ha will really enjoy the strain... just not me.‚Äù"

surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nebula-ii-cbd/reviews/1328638,"‚Äú5star for real. More than managed my pain by quickly relaxing my entire body. Chronic shoulder joint pain was gone. Great tasting puffs of sweet honey mango or something. Vaped! So smooth and yummy.

This strain freaked me out a bit because after a few hits I was pain free. For the first time in 6 years. No pain. I love this strain and I hope more CBD rich strains become available.

My friend does not smoke as much as me because he gets anxious a lot from weed so he bought 5g of Nebula 2 thinking he would be able to enjoy getting high without the anxiety.
