I ran from cops after smoking .5 of this and afterwards still had energy to burn. I have now found the perfect strain to smoke to go on adventures. you can walk/run forever and go all day without eating and be fine.

One second you were fine, the next you began tripping balls, a strong euphoric feeling and everyone who smoked it would laugh very hard for a good 3 minutes straight. Very strong and after smoking this, normal weed isn't as nice.‚Äù"

3 mm grinder.
Medium pack, 3 medium pulls.

A pleasant bouquet. Not intoxicating. Slightly rosy in smell. Pineapple Express would make a killer potpourri, and then you could smoke it too.
I will say that P Express doesn't hit as fully on the vaporizer as much as other buds, like Sour D or Kandy Kush, nor is it as tacky to the fingers. Its not a crystal blown out bud(at least this batch)...‚Äù"

I was already a few dabs of "haze" deep but after 2 of this Pineapple Express I was on my ass. I definitely felt it more so in my body. Very couch locked but uplifted feeling.

A very pungent taste much like most shatter.‚Äù"

Don't believe the hype!  In a lot of ways this strain is awful.

Yes, a mediocre stoner movie was made about it and yes it does taste really good.  If I rated this strain based on taste alone, it'd be 5/5.
