Bag Appeal:  4 out of 5.  looks like a good Kush.

Smell:  Not much when cracking the bag.  Less when breaking it up into grinder, and faint when ground up.

If any smell at all it's a little fruit punch smelling.

Exhale:  Oddly Chocolate.  Pretty dope.  Never had a strain do that.

pdxdave,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bloodhound/reviews/1319046,"“It has a great flavor and a very strong odor.  It's a pretty strong high, and made me a bit more useless than usual.  It's closer to couch glue than I was expecting, but I also wound up walking to a few bars/pubs after smoking some with a friend.

I wouldn't call it motivational, but it turned out to be a good variety before a social situation.”"

FoRob,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bloodhound/reviews/1292564,"“Very relaxing strain yet doesn't put me to sleep or give me extreme euphoria. I find it to be a great daytime smoke.”"
Headyzac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bloodhound/reviews/1317367,"“Moderate buzz, rather alert, and very earthy in flavor.  Looks are a 10/10, flavor is a 6/10, buzz is a 7/10.  Not one I would hunt down, but wouldn't turn it away in the $30 1/8th price point.”"
