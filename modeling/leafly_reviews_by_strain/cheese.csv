I know when I had cancer and smoked this strain, it made me so damn hungry and it made all my physical pain go away. It made me forget that I was sick and it uplifted me.

kittymang,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese/reviews/1414155,"“Something about the original cheese does wonders for my panic disorder. Even though it's indica dominant, this indica mixed acts like a straight Sativa for me. Only drawback is it makes me hungry and I don't need to be eating more. Otherwise one of my favorite strains. I always feel like a mushroom when I smoke the cheese. It's nice. High lasts a long time and is good for any time of day. Tasty.”"

This bud blew me mind from smell alone. Then I took it home and was only more impressed with all it had to deliver as an AAA sativa. Don't pass this one up. If grown right, it will make you a very happy cannibaasseur :)”"

This review will be writen during first use of said strains. and may be odd.

    Earthy and Cheddar/Gruyere (Quote Duff "mild & nutty yet pecan`t") smell with a richness that screams of baked macaroni and cheese. Dense but mildly sticky it has a tendency to stick to the bottom of my bud jar even when vigorously shaken >.<

Felt it behind my eyes and then started to feel the body high. Then took a few hits out of a gas mask. Overall really relaxing but not a total couch lock. One of my favorites so far.”"
