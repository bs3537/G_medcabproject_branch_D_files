I would like the price to come down and touch but I can't say it isn't worth it. great taste great body and cerebral effects. helps with the spasms and pain and is definitely better than some of the regular line of strains by Cresco. will definitely have to check out more reserve line strains by Cresco”"
noslo77,https://www.leafly.com/indica/joliet-jake/reviews/1511907,"“This one might be the strongest indica in Illinois. Definitely a strong pain reliever my body felt great.  My mind was relaxed and slightly numbed. I love indicas all day but this cross of Bubba Kush will put you to down if you let it and give you a full night of sleep. The taste is grape / berry with a little dirty hash kick. I perfer the live resin's taste over the shatters but they are both outstanding.  The Cresc...”"

I used JJ strictly in my Volcano (vaporizer) and he is one smooth bud. Beautiful flowers, phenomenal scents, and gorgeous colors. This new guy needs to stick around. JJ took me out of the low mood I had been under all day, got rid of my headache, and relaxed my entire being. He's a keeper:)”"
MrFiveString,https://www.leafly.com/indica/joliet-jake/reviews/1505188,"“by far one of the best indica's around right now. the Cbd's are over 3% and reaching almost 30% as flower it really is cresco representing Joliet correctly. being from there in all. five star plus on Joliet Jake reserve especially the shatter. you can't go wrong with the LR, S or flower. Well done Cresco”"

The@Zman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/joliet-jake/reviews/1591947,"“Joliet jake is a very relaxing strain. Great for pain and anxiety. At first i was skeptical because one of its parent strains is Katsu Bubba Kush which does give me anxiety. The other parent is pre 98 Bubba which ive never had so i can't comment. But Cresco combined the two and created a great relaxing Indica with lots of flavor. This is a very potent strain so start low and go slow. I would have given 5 stars but it...”"

As someone who is really anxious and in pain this was perfect. No anxiety but pairs well with Xanax if you’re prescribed it for a great pain relief. Lots of euphoria, full body relaxed and rather clear head at lower doses and is a hyperbolic high so rise carefully. Mine came in at almost 30%.”"

mstoney,https://www.leafly.com/indica/joliet-jake/reviews/1730224,"“Make. No. Plans

I like the Joliet Jake strain. it is my favorite of all of the Cresco Reserve products.  NY version is PA

good for the body and the mind

initial high is a warm tingling around the head and neck. then your muscles begin to relax. it is a fantastic melting feeling. so good for muscle cramps. I am an indica girl. this is a good indica strain. 

this strain is also a very good sleeping strain.

a great...”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/joliet-jake/reviews/1731108,"“Second time around, still not very sedating to someone with a moderate to high tolerance.
It's still a fairly good indica, gets rid of pain & nausea. The taste is okay. It's worth a try if you need to stay awake but still get the physical relief from an indica”"
Geekyzombie22,https://www.leafly.com/indica/joliet-jake/reviews/1741701,"“Live Resin Reserve Vape...has a bit of a kick at 1st, but well worth it. Excellent creeper that levels off and comes down smoothly. It helps with any kind of pain. Excellent strain for Depression & Anxiety as well. It helped calm my heart rate down and goes well with Klonopin. You can be happy toking by yourself with this strain. Can shift your focus, but in a good way. Joliet Jake is my favorite Indica!”"
gfunk76,https://www.leafly.com/indica/joliet-jake/reviews/1590933,"“The reserve live resin budder from Cresco is amazing. Smells and tastes fantastic as this particular line is loaded with terps. 

A little dab'll do to alleviate anxiety, induce appetite and help sleep .”"
MyJokerHandStayLIT,https://www.leafly.com/indica/joliet-jake/reviews/1665293,"“Joliet Jake Reserve - definite citrus or lemon terpy taste here. First of all this is beautiful medicine. Like shimmering in the light like diamonds wow. Ok but a small dab led me to a intense warm feeling staring from my head really staying in the upper body for a couple minutes then tingly down to your feet with warming all the way. My muscles 💪 relax and you can feel your body really becoming a jelly well more li...”"
CaptainQuazar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/joliet-jake/reviews/1773754,"“Joliet Jake will put you on a mission from God! I tried this in the form of Cresco Reserve sugar concentrate. Now I'm not an experienced concentrate user, so my opinion is uneducated. JJ hit me hard with a melty sense of body relaxation. Gave me that paralyzed feeling, not unable to move, just unwilling. Which for my pain is pretty nice. For sure an evening blend, made me sleepy. Which is nice for my insomnia. Pairs ...”"
JoeGuDDCbassist,https://www.leafly.com/indica/joliet-jake/reviews/1546168,"“This strain smells like fruit punch and has a berry flavor. the reserve line from cresco is great. I'm not a fan of the dryness but overall this strain is 5 star.”"

Looch325,https://www.leafly.com/indica/joliet-jake/reviews/1747045,"“Such an amazing strain, Bubba Kush is my favorite strain for almost 20 years. When I learned JJa was BK x 98bk I thought I may have found the holy grail. The concentrate this review is about was 1 gram of JJa Reserve line Live Sugar by Cresco Yeltrah but I really hope to try flowers of it ASAP. What can I say? I loved this stuff, everything about the taste, effects, etc. I'd love to try it without extra terps added i...”"
