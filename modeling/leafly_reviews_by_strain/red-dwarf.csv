First off, this bud was nice and soft to the touch, not wet, but perfectly cure. So many trichomes it shone in the light of my friend's basement. Then there were these beautiful, Blood Orange hairs that covered the bud so perfectly. It was almost as if it were a symmetrical creation. I also noticed on some spots on the bud, were light tint...”"

¿Olor? Uff! ¿Sabor? Dulce con toques terrosos ¿Colocón? Difícil de explicar, por una parte, al fumarla con alguien de confianza expande el diálogo y las risas sin dejar de estar con la mente girando, en cambio, al fuma...”"

jossm23,https://www.leafly.com/indica/red-dwarf/reviews/1133944,"“A very subtle high which isn't too aggressive, which makes me feel less mongy. Its chilled and giggly. The fact Red Dwarf has a lower THC content is quite nice in contrast to stronger strains. Sometimes a strong cerebral or body high can leave you feeling tired, but this is very manageable, but very nice.”"

seasideherb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/red-dwarf/reviews/1061927,"“Hard to find but definitely a must. Good for relaxing but not going to sleep right away. I always get it when I can find it. Definitely one of my personal favorites.”"
PlanetaVerde,https://www.leafly.com/indica/red-dwarf/reviews/1152369,"“Perfect strain for first time growers. I harvested 1kg (wet) from 5 plants with a 250W sodium kit. Not so strong high, it allows you to talk, relax and enjoy with friends. We just loved it!!”"

Booboo1973,https://www.leafly.com/indica/red-dwarf/reviews/1677598,"“The best strain i have ever had for extreme pain relief. I have been a smoker for about 5 years now and I have never found a strain like this! It knocks out the pain and stones you just a bit, it's the perfect strain for chronic pain. Highly recommend”"
Pigebarnet,https://www.leafly.com/indica/red-dwarf/reviews/1201719,"“My first time trying Red Dwarf, and the smell and taste of it is great. It has that flowery/earthy taste and gives such a mellow high, with a longing after your bed after a couple of hours 
Will definitely be trying this one again! 👍”"
