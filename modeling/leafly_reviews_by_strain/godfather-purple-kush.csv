The God kush I have is also purple so maybe it's the same thing. Anyway, it's very purple. It's a pretty bud! Very beautiful with tons of terp. Great for pain and stress. Longer lasting.”"

I raised the temp to 3 and I started getting very jittery. Will have to try again, the flavor is great but the side effects aren't seemingly worth it.”"
