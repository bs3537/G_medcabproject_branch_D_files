Very strong, pungent odor. Smells and tastes just as its name suggests.

It's Sativa dominant, so the buzz is very cerebral and focused. Dream-like at higher doses. I feel very accepting and understanding. 'Very calm and collected. So its absolutely perfect ...”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-diesel/reviews/1392423,"“Unbelievable, this stuff truly sends you to space. Probably the best strain I've ever smoked - definitely the most euphoric. Great for pain too, and lasts for hours.”"

weazal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-diesel/reviews/1412490,"“What a refreshing high, just like taking a bite of watermelon! And wonderfully visual, too - like a perfectly clear day on the ocean :D

There's an effervescence, an excitement in your gut. Your body feels perfectly relaxed and at ease, as though you're on vacation. It's like the distilled sensation of squirming and stretching in the most comfortable bed ever. 

Mind is definitely slowed, but thoughts come to you at ...”"
Towellie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-diesel/reviews/1417713,"“Lemon Diesel shouts "FORWARD!" and makes you flow forward confidently in positive directions.  A little outcome-orientated at times, but you can feel confident in your power.  Bursts through any mental blockages you perceive and allows things to fall into place like magic.  Get out in the sun and share some love with plants or people.  Have the best meal of your life about 2 hours after smoking.”"
curiousgeorge03,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-diesel/reviews/1412488,"“Smoke enough of this and you will get very high - your body feels relaxed and and your mind... Well your mind feels clouded and almost warped, but you can still strong a sentence together pretty well.”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-diesel/reviews/1380103,"“Lemon D. brings on a nice strong floaty buzz that lasts a couple of hours. It is great for relieving pain and depression. The effects are not overwhelming but strong enough to always remind you that you're well medicated.”"

Got this in a big batch. Didn't think much until i took my LED light to it and saw all the beautiful colors. Purples, lime and orange all around these round nugget-like buds. Lemon pledge smell to the buds but when ground up give the distinct smell of haze and hash, or "Diesel".

Jdelano122,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-diesel/reviews/1389180,"“This may be one of the best strains I've ever smoked. The effects took about 15 minutes to kick in but after that it lasted for several hysterically laugh filled hours. It causes a little bit of the munchies but it's mostly dry eyes and mouth. It's definitely great to get your mind off things and relieve stress.”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-diesel/reviews/1389179,"“One of my favorite strains for when i work...and play. that cant be said for a lot of strains. I blaze through assignments, extremely focused, energetic. This could win over some tobacco fans. 

When listening to music its more pleasurable, colors pop when gaming. Just a really solid strain that i think helps define Sativa.”"

eclectic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-diesel/reviews/1384709,"“Lemon Diesel really surprised me with its strong sativa attributes.  It's not an instant high as with other strains but after 5 minutes it kicks in with a long lasting focused type of high to a mellow high to balance  out the intense sativa.  I noticed that with just a little weed in a bong or glass pipe goes a long way. The smoke is thick and concentrated.  Sweet lemon sticks to your tongue with other subtle citrus ...”"

I feel alert and focused, yet also very floaty euphoric.  Feeling creatively inspired as well which is an added bonus.  Good flavor for a Diesel as well, (which aren't typically my favorite flavor profiles).”"

HighlandCountyJane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-diesel/reviews/1387852,"“I really enjoy this strain and would definitely buy it again. Lets start with flavor: The diesel definitely overpowers the citrus in my book . I definitely get a diesel taste followed by a "dirty" diesel/earthy aftertaste and not much sweet/citrus flavor. Not bad at all even though it may sound that way, just not lemon in my opinion.
