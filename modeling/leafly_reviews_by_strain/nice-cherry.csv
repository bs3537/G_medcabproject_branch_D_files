Jcwarner,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nice-cherry/reviews/1285750,"“very stoney! For me it has a very citrus smell with a hint of cherry. One hit, I was melted to the couch! overall a good relaxing high, but non motivated.”"

GordBirch,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nice-cherry/reviews/1344470,"“If I could give this a 6 out of 5 stars, I would - I do lots of reviews, and seldom am I just "Wow, I want to keep taking this medicine"

This is sweet, a very full bouquet, not just a sweetness to pot - but truly like berries in a bowl. The taste of the Rosin is a sweet cherry juice - and the high, oh that sweet mellow "Catch me if I fall" kind of mellow that would be great for writing poetry or music to.”"
