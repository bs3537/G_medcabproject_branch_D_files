I have a mild case which means that I have a slight muscle problem and facial ticks. When I hit this (only 2 hits from a piece) I thought I was cured. I like this strain because I can focus and get things done and for once, have a normal conversation with people. No memory loss, just an overall calmi...”"

When puffing on it solo I can make it 3/4 the way through a typical avg joint, then recommend saving the rest, cause this is some quality smoke. Great for that fresh from work smoke, where you still need to get dinner ready but need to take the kick out of your day.”"
