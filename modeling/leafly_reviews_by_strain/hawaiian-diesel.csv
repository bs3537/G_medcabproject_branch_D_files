CedmanJS,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-diesel/reviews/1442125,"“Sheer happiness and an absolute CREEPER. Also known as "Sour Hawaiin" here on the West Coast High doesn't truly kicks in until 45 minutes later. The first few puffs feel like a blast off into hyperspace; everything looks so vibrant and vivid which kinda reminds me alot of Strawberry Cough (another Sativa favorite of mine). I've smoked over hundreds of strains but this tops it off as the best sativa I tried. Definitel...”"

As far as the strain attributes, I would definitely agree on it making me feel happy and uplifted, but I don’t necessarily feel very energetic. Euphoric? I might call it something else. Creative? Definitely. I’ve been reading some of the things that I have been writing while under the spell of the...”"

After about an hour or so I get really hungry and then after I fill up on munchies I get really sleepy and end up taking like an hour or two nap. Highly recommended though!”"

Chrisfilio,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-diesel/reviews/1340345,"“True to the Diesel name. Also called "Sour Hawaiian" depending on where you pick it up. 

This sativa strain has a sweet earthy smell with a hint of diesel fuel scent. The taste is sweet and pungent like most other diesels. 

The high onset is quick and energizing. You get a quick jolt of creative energy and the instant need to get up and do something. 

Hawaiian Diesel is great for daytime use. The high last about 2...”"

Kerouac71,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-diesel/reviews/1460415,"“Really nice energy high from this strain. Definitely more sociable when smoking this. Being a card carrying misanthropist that says a lot. For me this also leant a creative edge that I would expect from a sativa but it’s much more with this particular strain.”"
