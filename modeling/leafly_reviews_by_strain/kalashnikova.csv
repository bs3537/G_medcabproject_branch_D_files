Stratocasterles,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1374596,"“(AK-47 x White Widow, Female)

This an absolutely wonderful strain with pungent terpenes  that create a wonderful piney and somewhat spicy aroma.  Another one of my favorites from greenhouse seeds.”"
mmmonicapb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1385699,"“AMAZING high. Left me with the MUNCHIES though. Makes you buy all you can find at 7-eleven and eat it.”"
sutherbland,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1376985,"“Kalashnikova is mind-blowing. It smells sweet, almost honey-like, and piney and tastes fruity, herbal, and earthy. I noticed that the indica effects hit me fast and hard while the sativa effects creeped in slowly and settled in as the indica high faded, making for a very robust yet chilled out high. I can see this being great for parties and other social settings or to get small errands done.”"
ChronicLeoKing,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1308154,"“This strain is a weird one, can give you a major headache or give you the biggest buzz. Drink lots of water with it, as it will give you dry mouth. The smells is soooo candy and sweet. The citrus mixed with some spice and touch of melon/honey is a must have! very dark with those crazy ak47 orange hairs and you will notice the White Widow taste, just a little! It is almost like a knock off brand of White Russian.”"

I usually just dig Sativas but I really like this strain, too. I suggest it for sure. Super relaxing, put me in a great mood. Made my eyes red as the devil's dick though!! ENJOY!”"

 significant other”"
Saturnica,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1264937,"“Really potent, the high reminds me of white widow with a tiny bit more cerebral effects. Had a bit of a creep to it, the indica hits fast but the sativa sides take more time to settle in.”"
SomethingWicked,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1193302,"“This strain in vape form is one of my favorites.  It keeps me going through many laborious tasks.  Anxiety levels stay at a low and euphoria is definitely noted.”"

aibreanban,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1387413,"“I had never tried this before and thought I should just have a little to test... felt very little. Next time (different day) I doubled (or more) the first amount and I was stunned stupid. You know that kind of feeling? Just all of a sudden a full high that lasted that same strength for over an hour before slowly coming down. I wasn't expecting that! Don't plan on doing anything that requires motor skills on this. Ver...”"
yogaboris,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1344011,"“Well someone wrote that its good for parties. But this strain just blocked my brain from thoughts. Maybe its good if u are suffering from anxiety. Potent tho”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1373194,"“Funky sweet smell that wasn't really for me but I ended up liking the strain, has a good taste and smokes well. Very social strain, good for a big joint at a party or before going out. Found it to be kinda mellow overall but clearheaded and calming with decent body buzz. 3.5/5”"
Telekinesis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1374274,"“The strongest strain I have had so far. Really enjoyed the high, would recommend”"

Th3Pu55ySl4y3r,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1322700,"“Great strain. Wicked cotton mouth. Can give a little headache at the end of the day, nothing crazy though. Really uplifting without being too couch locking. Thumbs up!”"

Loaded it into my vape pen and inhaled the goodness. Def can pronounce this strain but for sure would recommend it to others!”"
smokeajayme,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1673780,"“Purchased this strain at Nature's Medicine in Phoenix AZ, one of my fave dispensaries! This strain is pretty amazing. It was relaxing, yet made me laugh harder than I ever have in my life. There is a nice body buzz as well. I highly recommend if you're looking for strong pain relief and a nice cerebral high.”"
Qevo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1712963,"“Good strain with a cool name. Great Indica feeling in the body with that sativa in yor head. Good to chill on the afternoon watching your favorite show or just thinking. Make sure to have some snacks tho!!”"

DashCL,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1442120,"“Variedad muy facil de cultivar, con excelentes resultados en un cultivo de bajos lumines (150w), Floracion corta y de buena respuesta al abono. Un subidon claramente indico proporcionando una relajo corporal liberando del stress diario, muy buena inductora del descanzo y buen dormir.”"
katelea,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kalashnikova/reviews/1358912,"“AK-47 x White-Widow- mild taste and buds are not well developed.  smokes smooth, it's kind of nice.  i felt my mood uplift and this is definitely good for depression, much better thank AK-47.”"
