Phantom Cookies
=============
villainet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/phantom-cookies/reviews/1396068,"“This is by far my favorite strain! I have never before smoked any weed that completely and totally killed all my pain.  Ever. I know a lady who recently had her foot amputated and she had me bringing her this strain saying it was the only thing that helped the pain.  The pain relief only lasts about an hour or so, but it kills all pain better than any opiate I've ever encountered.  

Now as for the high... If I smoke...”"

bogreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/phantom-cookies/reviews/1365908,"“This strain is absolutely beautiful in every way. The high is strong and it last long.

It worked great with my anxiety and depression, it was nice to have quick instant relief. It also handles pain well, especially for head aches and migraines but any general pain. This stuff will have you feeling good.

The high extremely satisfying. Its a strong head high that will have you in pure bliss. It also has a warm fuzz...”"

The smell is a bit tropical citrus like, the flavors reflect that, and the high is amazing.  Super clean and energetic, only a small down when the high finally dissipates, as long as you didn't power toke.  Broke up really nicely, and vaped very well.  Will be on the look out for more Phantom cookies, a great day-time marijuana.”"

Leaves me relaxed with a buzz of creative energy. Definitely helped my back pains and GI issues. After the initial peak at about 10 minutes in, it maintains a powerful buzz for an hour, and the physical effects hang around for another hour after that. Will buy again if the batch is good.”"

Extract from phantom cookies in my opinion should only be recommended for those with an extremely high tolerance for cannabis.”"

Come down is sleepy (Thanks to GDP). If you've tried both GDP and Cherry Pie, this is THE example child-hybrid. Taste is okay vaped, but it's nothing special. This strain is a creeper.

I smoked Phantom Cookies with some friends who enjoy a nice cerebral high. I smoked about 20 mins before they arrived, so I was in full swing by the time they puffed.

col4bin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/phantom-cookies/reviews/1368458,"“Beautiful, dense structure. Dark greens and some bluishness. Frosted from here to the next place. Earthy aroma with more than a hint off diesel but barely a whisper of cherries and grape. Almost no flavor at all when smoked or vaped - kind of disappointing for such a beautiful flower. The effect also seems pretty mild on my endocannabinoid system. Not my favorite.”"
csnell4,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/phantom-cookies/reviews/1360175,"“This strain is not for the first timer. I recently tried it and was Blown away by the affects. very nice sedating with a little bit of jitters. Thoroughly enjoyed The Strain but should only be used in the p.m., I recommend this strain for people who are looking to alleviate insomnia. Two thumbs up but not for first timers.”"
kelvin81,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/phantom-cookies/reviews/1629031,"“Excellent day time strain. Maybe 75% Sativa and 25% indica effects.  As an anxious dude I avoid Sativas, and this hybrid has been the best day time strain for me. No anxiety or shakes, just a bright, relaxing high with a gentle body buzz. Potent stuff, got a good high from less than a bowl with medium tolerance. Has a great, strong fresh lemony flavor. Vapes super smooth, no coughing. All in all highly recommended.”"

I would say they're mostly 50/50 ...basically, you could get a durban poison pheno, a cherry pie pheno, a OGK pheno, a GDP pheno(which would be indica)...I personally think properly grown, cured Phantom Cookies is highly desirable.
