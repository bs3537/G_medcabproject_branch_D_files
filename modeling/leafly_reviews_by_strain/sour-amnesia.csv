Sour Amnesia
=============
Audio_Geek,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-amnesia/reviews/1393578,"“Hands down one of the best strains I have ever smoked.  It is simply incredible. 

On looks and smell alone I had to purchase it.  It smelt like a box of Sour Nerds candy and looked like something you would have found in a secret prototype room at Willy Wonka's factory. 

The effects of this particular strain are some of the best I have ever felt; I was relaxed, lucid, stress free and surprisingly cheery.  It lifted ...”"

 - Decent Taste ( i wasn't a big fan but my friends were )

- Smooth Throat Hit

- Uplifted, Energetic, Alert High”"

Holy shit best high i've ever had, i'd describe it as 'clean' it's just a great uplifting creative high. Don't try and sleep after a gram joint of this though or your head will be spinning!
Smoked 2 bowels in my hot tub and felt like I was falling :D”"
eymacassi,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-amnesia/reviews/1393649,"“I am usually an indica or indica dominant girl, so I was going out on a limb getting this stuff. The look of the bud was awesome. Super frosty, thick but not too dense or crusty. The smell was really interesting. Almost like orangey, citrusy, or like citrus candy. Very sweet smelling. The taste was toasty and kind of earthy I think. Hard to put my finger on. The smoke was thick. At first, I felt a very nice body high...”"
LeroyBrown420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-amnesia/reviews/1358356,"“Diesel knocked up Amnesia and their sweet flower child is a total knockout. Sour D makes everything better, trumping Amnesia musty flavor in lieu of a tart, citrusy, funk and smooth Diesel exhaust. This hip new twist on an old twist is hands down better than her predecessors.  I hope she sticks around awhile, shes grand.”"
ghostinthetoast,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-amnesia/reviews/1387722,"“This is my new favorite sativa. So good I went back for more fearing it might run out. 

Starts with a powerful, mildly distorting high that comes on fast and tingles from head to toe.  Cuts pain well.  Settles in with a contented feeling that slows your roll w good vibrations.  Hard to focus the ole eyeballs but vision and coordination remain acute even at high speeds. 

No bad side-effects like dry mouth, which is ...”"

flipndip187,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-amnesia/reviews/1333605,"“Sour Amnesia is absolutley amazing. Take variety i got was actually Amnesia Haze x Sour Diesel so it was heavy sativa, the color and look diddnt remind me of sour until a closer look showed those curled tips and sour bud structure.Its Overall green/yellow color turns out to be a mix of pink,purple,green,yellow,and red under a white light. The smell was more fruit/citrus but the taste was the very distinct sour diesel...”"
LostTechnique,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-amnesia/reviews/1361291,"“This strain is an absolute must try!

The smoke is very Skunky/earthy with a hint of diesel as an aftertase. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the Amnesia genetics overpower the diesel/chem on this one. 

I bet if this strain were to be grow outdoors, it would be some of the best smelling herb. 

This feels like a true sativa to me...It's probably one of., if not THE best
feeling  behind my eyes I have ever come ac...”"
AlienOG88,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-amnesia/reviews/1576050,"“Pretty Tasty, hits quickly, gives you the kinda high where you just sit there and smile saying over and over to your friends “dude, I’m so high right now.” one of the best strains I’ve had. Hard to come by though.”"
vsnsfxl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-amnesia/reviews/1356353,"“This strand was amazing. I'm prone to anxiety and panic attacks when I smoke, so I usually stick to indicas. I wanted to try a sativa again since I hadn't in a while and decided to go with this. Within 5 minutes after smoking it, I immediately could feel the stress and tension drain from my body. I noticed it when I felt my shoulders feeling really loose and at ease (they are usually pretty tense). I also got pretty ...”"

The sweet floral smell has a slight hint of its Sour Diesel parent and but the is much more evident in the taste which is surprisingly mostly sour with a hint of fruityness. The buds are huge and show colors of yellow green and slight purple spots. The buds lean heavy towards the amnesia side with their look but thats not a bad thing they are beautiful.

I've had this strain a few times before but the batch I got today blew my mind. Nugs were super dense, a beautiful green covered in wild orange hairs. It smelled like a muted slight hazy Sour D.
