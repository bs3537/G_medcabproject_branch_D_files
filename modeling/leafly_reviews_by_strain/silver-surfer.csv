Silver Surfer

deadvirgo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-surfer/reviews/1390848,"“This is the best strain I've ever smoked. Normally, I'm too paranoid to drive within about 4 or 5 hours of smoking, but when it's Silver Surfer, I could drive a fucking plane under a bridge without breaking a sweat. If you get the chance, smoke a fat bowl of this shit and you'll see where I'm coming from. By far the most purely positive pot experience I've had. This is my first and (probably) only review on Leafly. I...”"
cannachris46,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-surfer/reviews/1387700,"“This strain just works for me. The past 3 days I was up at 3:30 a.m. to drive into work 11 hour days and having a bowl of Silver Surfer each morning helped me work more focused and efficiently. It's definitely more effective as a wake and bake strain than later in the day (for me). The other nice thing is that I feel a long lasting uplifting mild euphoria that doesn't seem to affect my eyes and mouth, so while I feel...”"

Vision is much narrower, almost too shallow depth of field. Again, has that kush-like cinematic vibe, so a net improvement despite heavy, stoner lids. Mental space is this pocket of willful clarity that’s surprisingly functional; perfectly able to think and work when considering how crazy high it makes you feel. Speaking of wh...”"

SILVER SURFER, from CPA/Nuggetry

----------------------------------
Smell: Musky citrus cheese.Essentially, if you want to know the smell, imagine what it would be like if you threw super silver haze and kali mist in the same jar. 

Buzz: It's a good sativa dominant buzz. You're going to get some indica effects if you smoke a lot of it. It's a very happy, talkative, and calm buzz. One ...”"
infinidro,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-surfer/reviews/1196326,"“Some spot-on results from this strain today. Good for afternoon use and early evening; sets the tone just right for dinner with a heightened sense of taste (but not the munchies) and a high level of energy and concentration (for cooking). Definitely put me in a good humor, with lots of laughs to be had. Very heady high, little to no couch-lock. The only downside is slight paranoia while in public. This strain has eve...”"

Hendertucky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-surfer/reviews/1311059,"“I picked up a gram of Silver Surfer to try by Evergreen Organix. 24.6 THC, 0.05 CBD. I found the bud to be a little dry. After smoking one bowl, my goodness did it hit me hard. I immediately got anxious and my chest got tight. Laid down and focused on my breathing. (FYI this is a great trick to calm down if you smoked too much or strain is too strong). The initial strong head change lasted 20 minutes then smoothed ou...”"

alexoop,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-surfer/reviews/1387702,"“Very strong high, very head and strong body highs, lots of tingling and heaviness in extremities. Vapes really well and doesn't take as much as normal. Which is good - I don't know if it's indicative of the strain but there seemed to be a higher ratio of kief in the plant material.”"
Hendertucky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-surfer/reviews/1326346,"“STRONG! 
 It's a creeper. When the initial head change took place my anxiety really amped up. I felt my chest get tight. So I stuck my usually routine when things like this happen. Just found a comfy place at home, laid down and closed my eyes focused on my breathing. Just a simple trick if a strain is too strong.

I would recommend this strain to people who can handle a strong sativa. I can see how much energy you c...”"

WhiteGold,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-surfer/reviews/1077544,"“SSH is a classic top shelf bud, if done right. It's hella heady, so watch out for that if you do not like sativa's. This will get you high really fast, almost instantly and you do not need a lot to get there either. Highly recommended for anyone that has never had it. It has a real fresh/citrus-y taste to it - always kind of reminds me of a fresh sprite or something. I think the best way to smoke it is to grind up, b...”"
mrobadamus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-surfer/reviews/1269552,"“Although it is a hybrid, it definitely feels like a sativa. Very light airy bud that crumbled really well but burns a little too fast and doesn't pack a high THC count. Would give it a higher score if the price was lower. Reach for a Blue Dream or Allen Wrench if you want similar high but better experience or price.”"

Currently on a [10] we both agree that George W. Bush was our greatest president! Great Strand!!!”"

Unique smoke flavor, Not very good strain to let the vapor get stale, it becomes very harsh and awful tasting.”"

Fufu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-surfer/reviews/1077520,"“I smoked some of this with a friend once, at first it was a fun giggly high but once he left it made me extremely anxious and paranoid. This was the first high I didn't enjoy. I think it would be a great strain to smoke socially, but I definitely don't recommend smoking this alone. It did smell great though and had a lot of crystals. It was very strong too.”"
