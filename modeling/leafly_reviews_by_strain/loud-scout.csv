Budagirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-scout/reviews/1361158,"“A hybrid that is great any time of day. This is a potent strain giving a euphoric effect almost instantly. Soft, sticky, sweet smelling and smooth burning this strain is a real treat.”"

trumanmoth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-scout/reviews/1409907,"“Loved this one to decompress for the evening. Anxiety and pain melted away into an instant euphoria, followed shortly by a more calm and relaxed mind and body. I was still able to maintain a clear head and enjoy a little TV followed by a brief nap (with very interesting dreams). All in all, I think this is a versatile and tasty strain!”"
PotsterBoy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-scout/reviews/1351846,"“This strain provides the best cerebral experience of any of the oils I have tried. After 30 minute or so, it settles into a nice calm and relaxing body felling.”"

When I ran across Loud Scout at Rocky Road Remedies in Colorado,  I had to give it a try since your mixing GSC with Platinum OG, I figured it would be pretty strong , but it wasn't. The taste is nice and sweet and after a couple of minutes,  you go into a nice euphoric head high and your body just relaxed without any couch lock....”"

PotsterBoy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-scout/reviews/1202563,"“This is in the form of Hash Oil:
One of the very few oils that delivers as strong a cerebral feeling as does leaf. A good head rush like a Diesel but no anxiety or paranoia followed by a lengthy body calmness.
Great for posting on the internet and listening to music.
A bit of munchies but not too bad ... just stay busy and occupied.”"

jkushfly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-scout/reviews/1468518,"“Tight dense medium to large nugs. definitely a smooth smoke - hits hard and gives a  good buzz. longer lasting than average. however its a bit of a headachey  strain though.”"
jodybailey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-scout/reviews/1395929,"“Not my favorite strain at all! It has a pleasant grape taste,  but very harsh on my throat. What I have  tested at 18%, but it doesn't have the punch I'm looking for. This one is a PASS for me next time around.”"
