CanadianCannabisKid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-poison/reviews/1392021,"“I recently picked up a healthy portion of Green Poison. I was initially drawn to its sweet citrusy and subtle earthy/piney aroma. Its buds are dense but light, with a generous dusting of sticky trichomes that leaves your finger tips smelling of freshly peeled oranges.

It's an incredible mix that I started growing after my second harvest, and though I have tried many other strains since then, I keep growing this one. I find this plant the most balanced for a small grower.
