I believe it's the most beautiful strain I've ever seen.  This strain is packed with multi colored leaves and hairs from purple and blue to pink and orange.  The smell is unlike any other...  A blast of tangy fruit and fresh roses.  The taste is very earthy and leaves you with a rather pleasant after taste =) Sh...”"

ohyeah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/shishkaberry/reviews/1396026,"“This strain is advertised as 80/20 Indica dominant, but it seems to be closer to 50/50. Sativas tend to make me a bit nervous and shaky especially when I'm alone, so I prefer to medicate with mild Indicas later in the evening.

This Shiskaberry, from Fweedom co-op, looks and smells a lot like the popular "B.C. Bud" smuggled across the Canadian border during the 1990's. There must have been additional Sativa genetic...”"

No anxiety/paranoia (an absolute must for me). Body high a lil heavier than I remembered but still very nice! Head high knocked my @## out, oops! Don't think my hubby was planning on that, lol!

Kepler420B,https://www.leafly.com/indica/shishkaberry/reviews/1350693,"“Shishkaberry smells incredibly sweet and florally all through veg. her aromaticness only intensifies in flower. the high has as much to offer as the flavor and smell. peaceful, yet, cerebrally stimulating and madly relaxing. fading into a sound and solid sleep is no sweat when the high begins to wear away. the potency is second to none, so use real caution when cooking and baking with her. I would highly recommend Sh...”"

This is the strongest indica I’ve used to date! Mine tested at 24.94% THC and .04% CBD. This one truly makes you feel “stoned” as opposed to “high”. My head feels heavy and my eyes feel puffy and red just like all the stoner cartoons, and I’m very relaxed. I used this briefly twice and it put me to sleep both times.

The high was a nice mellow that I usually get from strains with blueberry in them and also a nice amount of pain relief for me. Its made me want to take a nap.

Taste is like sweet berry or a slight blueberry which is pretty spot on for the strain.”"
