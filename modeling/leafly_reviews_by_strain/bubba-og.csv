heychar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bubba-og/reviews/1194009,"“I personally don't like the taste of it -- super earthy and sour. The high is nice though, but I smoked some with a couple friends and I definitely recommend it alone. It also gives me wicked munchies and really good sleep with very vivid dreams.”"
