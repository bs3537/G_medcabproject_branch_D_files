Wappa
=============
JerZBoY031,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1398366,"‚ÄúThe wappa grown from Compassionate ATC in south JerZ is legit.  Very dense, heady, strong and clean all the way through. Consistently a light green bud with frosty tips and orange hairs.  Strongest bud they have THCA is like 26 I think.  Has a clean weed taste.  Not a gimmicky flavor just a nice full bodied herb.‚Äù"
PaddyOB,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1396838,"‚ÄúI was actually quite blown away by this strain. First off, it smelled like heaven. Very strong scent. I don‚Äôt care to add fruity wine style flavor reviews, so I‚Äôll just say this, tastes like marijuana. very good marijuana.

ChristianNutt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1285741,"‚ÄúAbsolutely dandy medicine! Great for my chronic pain & discomfort in my foot!‚Äù"
realniccage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1285722,"‚ÄúWappa is amazing. Such a pleasant shade of green with almost a blue glow at times. Big fluffy nugs with excellent density. Doesn't make me too dumb to function and doesn't over stimulate me. Its my personal favorite of all time.‚Äù"
Urbanlgnd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1396206,"‚ÄúHits very quickly but after about 15 minutes it smooths out quite nice.  Smells very fruity but smokes like a clean smoke, very flavourful!

will be buying again in the future :D‚Äù"
BrianPallister,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1741452,"‚ÄúNormally I‚Äôm more interested in sativas and sativa dominant hybrids but I picked up an eighth of this to aid with relaxation at the end of the day and wow am I impressed. It doesn‚Äôt lock you into the couch because you‚Äôre too lazy to get up, you‚Äôre immobile because it feels fantastic to just chill out after smoking this.‚Äù"
Skatmandoom1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1442858,"‚Äúdecent high I think this would be a good strain to cross with silver Haze‚Äù"

VIPanda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1245570,"‚Äúsmells like fruity chewing gum, tastes a bit like mud at the start but then starts getting sweet. The high is amazing though, put me to sleep!! only thing is i needed a drink like all the time. Im from UK.‚Äù"

thehappyhorror,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1346689,"‚ÄúNot for me.  I don't know why, but this strain gives me huge anxiety EVERY time I smoke it. I have no problem with much stronger strains so I'm not sure why wappa makes me trip, but it does. I'm too cheap and broke to throw it out so I have to take xanax everytime I smoke it . I'm actually looking forward to running out.‚Äù"
aurumjd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1366441,"‚ÄúWeaker than I thought it would be.  Found myself having to mix strains with this to make it interesting.‚Äù"

anturaj,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1366947,"‚ÄúMuy buen sabor afrutado y fresco, subidon r√°pido, pero no te aploma al principio. luego va subiendo un efecto relajante contundente, perfecto para ver la tv una pel√≠cula o dormir.‚Äù"

Vblover16,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1366946,"‚ÄúNothing wrong with it. It could be I was dissatisfied by the price. It was from Sonic Green. I paid $65 for an eighth. Didn't live up to $65 weed.‚Äù"
fictionimustfake,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1412423,"‚ÄúIt made me way too tired and stupid, but it also eased muscle aches. Other hand, it gave me a headache from the gnarly coughs‚Äù"
larryd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1154901,"‚ÄúI grew my plant last summer, but just now trying. Very nice high. Helps with my back pain. Relaxing without making you sleepy. Just a generally good feeling. Very stoned, but not over the top.‚Äù"
TORI947,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1416130,"‚ÄúDisappointing. Got mine from a Medical Dispensary, and it is one of the only Indicas I have not really liked..
Oh well..lots of others to choose from:)‚Äù"
