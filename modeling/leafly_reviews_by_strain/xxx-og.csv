It is a beautiful flower that I donated for at ODC (One Drop Collective,) in Bakersfield, CA.  I loved the pungent OG smell with very slight skunkiness.  After the first hit I wondered, hmm, then, WHAM!  So for me, a definite one-hit-and-quit strain.  XXX OG allowed symptoms of carpal tunnel, muscle spasticity, and i...”"

Thats really a steal for what you're getting, a pretty good mid-high grade thats strong and reliable. This isn't really a euphoric, happy giggly kind of strain.

Ate about 20mg of a chocolate pretzel using this strain, and I had pretty significant psychoactive effects, that I usually experience from around 35-40mg of an edible. Definite Indica, as it eases you into your bedroom and into your bed. Makes you lose focus on everything else and just melt away into a blissful euphoria and appreciate everything around you, without a care in the world.”"

You do not need much to get you in a good mood or to take a good nap!

Purchased at White Mountain Health Center. Highly recommended.”"
