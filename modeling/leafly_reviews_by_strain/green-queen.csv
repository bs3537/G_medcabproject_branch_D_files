Green Queen
=============
MellowSailor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1417247,"“First, let me state that I am very picky in what strains I medicate with.  I have tried all kinds of strains and am very specific in the effects I want to feel.  I need cannabis to 1) Calm my stomach/intestines immediately and take away nausea - and - 2) Provide me with a clear, manageable high that does NOT induce paranoia or anxiety.  

I have severe IBS, GERD and a host of other intestinal issues, so a high CBD ...”"

Oowee, I'm not disappointed! This strain is a strange taste experience... What starts off as an earthy floral turns into hints of blueberry and pine, the fuck? Beautiful crystals all over light green buds, this stuff speeds up the mind and smiles up the face. Great for wake n bakes, pre-party joints, and ice in ...”"
TravaGras,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1381048,"“A bit like Green Crack, but more mellow. Wakes you up, increases focus, but isn't as tense.”"

I still had a good experience, and still felt quick to relax muscles and do a lot of range-of-motion stretching, but I also felt much more mentally affected (kind of stupor-ish) and kind of agitated.  I spent much of the first hour and a half unable to sit still for very long, and noticed I was pacing around a lot,...”"
HyperboreanWanderer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1413984,"“Worthy of its name, though heavy hitters will probably need two and a half bowls, it is pleasantly fragrant in smell and taste. Long lasting effect of up to three hours.”"

JadeFX,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1359034,"“One of my favorites I've found so far, not top shelf but definitely worth the price!  The high is very floaty and relaxing, probably from the space queen, yet very euphoric and happy from the green crack.  You can definitely tell its a hybrid, though I would say it's more of a head high than a body high.  Very versatile strain, I've had crazy party nights on this and very relaxing, enjoyable, nights in with friends o...”"
iSmokedThat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1361501,"“Nice, Fun, Quick Buzz. Gotta pack a few bowls to get a long buzz other than that you come down pretty quick. Tingly feeling is a sure thing and no Paranoia. Leaves a crappy taste in your mouth but Arizona Green Tea always fixes that. I suggest you always have a glass when u smoke this one. 
Lastly, IDK if this was due to a perfect grind and pack but one bowl just would not end.!!”"

OGknownforsmoking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1412565,"“Green Queen is dope. I've gotten a tolerance over the years so I always look for indicas. Usually because of its ability to knock out anxiety. But this Green Queen though is good. Good for energy,video games, school work. Definitely focused right now.”"
annonymouse,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1070324,"“An Indica dominant hybrid with an appealing tropical fruit scent and tastes great as well. Delivers a great body high, and a sleepy euphoria that is not at all overpowering. Also delivers a fair amount of pain relief and is great for insomnia as a night time toke 1-3 hours before sleep.”"
Sativa_Dominate,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1412314,"“I picked an ounce of Green Queen not to long ago from collective awakenings.  This was my first time trying this strain, and I was not disappointed.  Its one of the better strains Ive ever encountered.  I felt happy, euphoric, and relaxed but not lazy.  I will definitely be back for more.”"
hellsangels,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1361500,"“Green Queen is AMAZING! Great for wake and bake, customer service, and before bed time. I recommend GREEN QUEEN if you are spending a night out with a lady. Thank you Portland, OR dispensaries for the GREEN QUEEN!”"

Smell is great and the taste is even better!

It's a very potent strain, definitely for veteran smokers. If you're a newbie- take a few rips and wait.

My favorite hybrid strain.”"

crazycolton55,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1147062,"“when smoked it has a harsh smoke that makes you cough but when the woody tasting coughing is over it leaves a sweet menthol berry flavor in your mouth. hits you hard and is an amzing high that effects every part of your body. great hybrid.”"
Bballspree88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1253312,"“I expected a lot more from this strain.. Its a middle of the road hybrid nothing special.. Mild energy, mild creativity, no stoney effects at all. Felt more like a sativa than hybrid to me but still a weaker one.”"
JustAnotherDruid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1070349,"“You go along for a while using the same strain, and think you're starting to understand the varietal you're using and how it balances out between relieving symptoms and interfering with ordinary functioning, and then you discover it can still surprise you.  Green Queen has been the only strain in my stash for weeks.  I had my usual small pipe bowl of this at around 7 pm; by 8:00 I'd eaten twice as much dinner as I'd ...”"
def1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1301759,"“A little bit of this strain goes a long way. Even for veteran smokers. More on the sativa side and can easily be overdone. Has a paranoid effect but also a nice cerebral buzz at the same time. Great for day use.”"

iitzMunchiiez,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1329957,"“Amazing strain! I am a long time smoker and have a high tolerance, not too many strains can get me feeling it in a few hits like green queen. this is definitely in my top five strains of all time!”"

No anxiety/paranoia (an absolute must for me). Body high allowed me to eat a decent breakfast. Head high allowed me to start my day which this morning was very difficult. High lasted 3 + hours which was awesome for a Sativa dominant. Still one of my favs! Highly recommend for daytime use for pain/nau...”"

ChristWithAY,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1070357,"“Green queen is my go to when I need to be productive. This is the most productive strain I've used with the least amount of anxiety. Can also be very giggly. I've been told that it's the Space Queen portion of this strain that gives it the happy giggle feel, but I've yet to duplicate that with any other strains.”"
dawgwings,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1190648,"“Very Nice!! Super relaxing with a fantastic mood lift, Perfect!! Its exactly why I love Hybrid's, and the pain relief from this strain is so soothing. So glad I found this great Queen, If I have a chance to purchase this again, Well, put me in Checkmate!!”"

I smoked more than my usual amount trying to achieve a high that I didnt really come across.  I was surprized to see its parent strains which both are 2 of my favorites.  I had to review Green Queen because I love it's name 💚”"
cannakyau,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1070335,"“Strong taste similar to what others have mentioned.

hydophotis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1195316,"“it's an OK buzz but the stem within the buds are thick. you end up with more lumber and less bud making it effectively a higher cost buzz.”"
broncoblade,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1300396,"“It got me high when others failed. Heady behind the eyes but not tired, type of high. Talkative and philosophical, but not necessarily the most linear ideas when smoking this.”"

I have had Epic Green Queen and it was one of my favorites.  This was stringy, burned fast, did not taste good, or do the trick medically.”"
cubiccube,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1199046,"“One of my favorite strains!  Gives a wonderful body buzz without making you sleepy AT ALL.  Very relaxing for muscles; I love it for treating my pain.  The buzz can get pretty strong in your head if you have a lot of it, so I tend to stick to small amounts.”"
Constant_StateOfMeep,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-queen/reviews/1220882,"“My experience with this strain has been great, it's very effective in managing my pain and muscle spasms specifically.  I also felt a mild, but pleasant head buzz which gave me a little extra energy.  Amazing pain fighter for those looking to still be productive and focused after use.”"

Everything I see is compared to this strain and its a big deal when I find something that's comparable! I have never found anything else that's this quality and available frequently....
