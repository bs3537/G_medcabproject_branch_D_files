Alien Dutchess

WhoIsNumberTwo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1375622,"“I am using cannabis to help aid in recovery from a long term traumatic abuse. Since THC is considered the psychoactive part of the cannabis plant, higher THC levels assist me in becoming self-aware and help me with my psychiatric goals. This plant has helped me more than any antipsychotic, anti anxiety, anti depressants, benzo, or SSRI. The mentioned drugs can (and do) work, but the side effects are atrocious. Cannab...”"
kyletuch,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1375623,"“Definitely a hybrid feeling, not Sativa. Perfect any time of day smoke, helps me with headaches, nausea and anxiety. Makes me feel happy, relaxed and uplifted and clear headed. Would definitely recommend! Anything with "Alien" that I've tried so far has been phenomenal(Alien Bubba, Alien OG).”"
lighthearted,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1359381,"“Found myself just smiling . Very nice motivational feelings came over me. I enjoyed  my morning walk from  start to finish. Try this one  and watch Spring arrive”"
sublime79,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1362455,"“I bought alien dutchess and it is wonderful!  It helps my neurapathy with the 28% thc.”"
Mbrock,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1679353,"“Tasty and smooth in a concentrate form, the Terp notes are delicious, while still providing a unique blend between the earthy, piney, and lemon. Definitely uplifting without just staying in your head. Would definitely recommend cresoco’s products especially this specific strain.”"
lawofsin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1382671,"“The euphoria and creative boosts are a favorite part of this strain. Great for stress and anxiety which I suffer severely from, after for many prescriptions I found a strain I can enjoy regularly. Wonderful for a sesh or group hang out.”"
Doodle-Oop,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1514121,"“Good Stuff! My stress is down, I'm feeling hazy but awake, Feels pretty potent, I'm even having trouble writing this review, lol. It's been helpful with my pain (lower back/sciatica) as well. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!”"
RedEmma,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1394552,"“Very relaxing. Slightly elevated happiness. Didn't give me the munchies much.”"
popedirtynacho,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1582875,"“While I enjoyed the uplifting sensation, I found myself talking quite a bit. It was fun to smoke but I felt like my mind was going a mile a minute”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1679550,"“I'd say this is a solid 5/5

Kills depression, nausea, pain, and anxiety. 
Definitely earthy and citrus. Effects last for hours. 
This is one of the best wake & bake strains I've ever had. I don't get overwhelming anxiety or paranoia like some do,5ze”"
Stoner_mom,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1608770,"“I’ve struggled with migraines for years, and this is the first Sativa I’ve found that helps with them! I’ve currently had a headache for six days now and within twenty minutes of smoking, it’s finally gone! It’s a spicy, piney taste that leaves you feeling calm yet focused. I know some have said it makes their anxiety worse, but that’s not true for me. 5/5 would definitely recommend and will absolutely purchase again...”"
MyJokerHandStayLIT,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1690322,"“Alien 👽 Ducthess Wax - wake and dab for this one.  Singing at 70.5% cannabinoids let’s try it out it’s known to be a great stimulator as well as a relaxing strain at the same time.

I feel a body hit of relaxation almost wanting to put me back into bed but then a burst of mental energy (not clarity I might add) balances it out. I loved the smooth taste of the wax as well as the relaxing aroma. I feel creative and...”"
chris003,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1771705,"“The high is very nice and energetic, but it has an almost heavy indica-like finish. The Dutch Treat lineage is always fun, but I think this should be classified as a hybrid.”"
DieselDude420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1539614,"“This is just labled "Dutchess" when I bought it - but it said "Dutch Treat" x "Alien Kush".

Anyway - It was SO GOOD, I went back 3 days later hoping it was still there and bought 1/4 more.

This is GREAT WEED.  (Now this is very dense green only, little orange other than the T's)   so it may be different.  

But, this is the perfect weekend weed - I mean, so chill and every single time it has made my MUSIC just rich...”"
TuffDreamer18,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1508390,"“Great strain. It immediately helps aleviate the pain. Its more of a hybrid with mild body relaxation.   Earthy taste, not crazy about the taste but overall a great uplifting strain for the daytime.”"
CaptainQuazar,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1763487,"“Alien Dutchess sugar from Cresco delivers a strong start to your day. With a sweet & spicy flavor it vaped well, minimal coughing. Heavy and fast hitting. A little edgy.”"

melissalite,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1645821,"“This was my first ever and go to and wished there was no shortage but there is. This strain helped me so very much in the beginning and then poof, gone. Saved a G. Of Shatter for 2 months after using wax for awhile and now I just wished I could get this strain soon. But I will again. lol I didn't like it as a wax to be honest. I wasted quite a bit and paid way too much. The shatter was light beautiful amber like a Ch...”"

CiciAmelia,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1708390,"“This is a smooth and potent "happy high" just as promised. Taste, smell both nice, citrus-ey and not too sweet. Feeling is uplifted and dreamy, not tired.”"
MedicalGod,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1358216,"“This strain is pretty good it makes nice and relaxed but very hungry that's the only downfall other than that it's a good strain!”"
Tenochito,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1787111,"“This is my go to strain.  I use the sugar concentrate on my dab rig.  Very smooth, nice effects.  The reason it’s my go to is the price.  It’s always the lowest price per gram.  I’d say it’s similar to anything alien you’ve had.”"
PhillyMMJ,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1748037,"“This is a great go-to strain for your every day wake and bake sessions. it will get your day off to an amazing, uplifted, and energetic start while still producing the "head high" feeling, but it doesn't make you tired. I would highly recommend this for anyone who has trouble getting motivated (or conditions that cause this such as depression or bipolar disorder), wants a relaxed yet energetic high and for those who ...”"
ChiTownConnoisseur,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1383499,"“Terps were unique and it was frosty. Bud structure wasn't the best, boosting buzz was decent.”"
Terri75,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1462768,"“The smell I got was a nice pine tree type smell. Just after a couple puffs I felt the  greatest feeling of relaxation, pain relief come over me. It was great. I also did not get the munchies like I thought I would have been so that's always a positive. This one will remain on the top of my list to re-buy. If you haven't tried you should.”"
mantis86,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alien-dutchess/reviews/1495366,"“The aroma is mild, with notes of earth, pine, and citrus. Analgesic, expectorant, and Anti-inflammatory. Even though Alien Dutchess is a Sativa dominant strain, the hybrid growing eliminates the head high. Which allows for great use during normal day hours. One of my favorite Sativa blends.”"
