Kong

DankKnight91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kong/reviews/1384271,"“This is my new favorite strain. No, really. This strain feels easy on the lungs and the high is instant. A relaxing body high and all-around happiness will hit you within seconds of your first puff. 
You can keep smoking this and not really reach that "uncomfortable zone" many of us are familiar with, and is fairly priced for the product it is. You could drop more money on a strain like GSC and maybe get a more aggre...”"
CornBreadCollardGreens,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kong/reviews/1375720,"“All I can say is DAMN, this is one of the best strains I have ever smoked. The taste is unbelievable with such a citrusy & earthy taste, the smell is also awesome. Heavy hitter, will leave you ready to munch and hit the netflix. Whoever grew this did the damn thing.”"
mmjmomlegalizeit81,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kong/reviews/1373419,"“Kong has become a new favorite of mine lately. A great indica-dominant daytime strain for a seasoned smoker. I read that it helped with anxiety, and the anxiety really has dissipated compared to how I was feeling 5 minutes ago so that's a major bonus in my book. Well rounded heady/body high..you won't be disappointed. Annd you'll also be taking in a flower that hails from the other side of the world. Very cool!”"

MrJane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kong/reviews/1225703,"“Kong is king! This is an amazing indica dominant hybrid with dense colorful buds.

Copper00,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kong/reviews/1758898,"“I love it. Very nice body high, I’m learning with vapes if your like me and treating chronic pain the highest temps possible are the best. Maybe more exaggerated effects but pain relief is better but so far smoking beats a vape 100% if the time.

Hits you with a wave of thc then it mellows out with a buzzing head feeling. 

Very relaxing and uplifting high for how powerful ...”"

ThuGlyph69,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kong/reviews/1226156,"“Wow, what a bud. This stuff will knock you on your ass within moments of sparking up a bowl. The folks at Holy Smoke Seeds definitely created something genuinely awesome here with this indica dominant Hybrid strain. It hits smooth but punches hard. It's fragrance is copacetic, but the taste can be a bit rough. It's like licking some pine sap straight out of a tree.

willfoster2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kong/reviews/1317509,"“This strain is definitely a part of the OG family. It has hints of diesel and is extremely gassy. Dense structure with a impressive trichome gallery flourish these buds if they are grown correctly. Perfect anytime weed because you get the euphoric and relaxed body high. Kong OG has made its way into my personal favorites.”"
illendent,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kong/reviews/1331037,"“Kong is a heavy one for sure. I'll definitely be picking this one up again for the simple fact that it can provide heavy medication without putting you to sleep. you'll feel weighed down and relaxed for sure but unless it's bed time you shouldnt have a problem staying awake! I think every smoker should give this bud a try.”"

BuddLyfe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kong/reviews/1411754,"“Idk I didn't like King because its the type of leaf that makes your head spin if you hit it too hard .. I hate weeds that get me dizzy & shit .. anyways I ain't got much to say about it .. the buds are beautiful & the smell is cool but the high can be too much ..”"

southeastwood,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kong/reviews/1263670,"“Smells good, taste is a bit harsh, loose nugs, a little goes a long way, but wears off quicker than other strains. After one hit, in less than 5 mins, effects ease in softly and quickly. Heartbeat increases at first but no anxiety. Easy to control focus. Relaxing, fun, focused, attentive.”"
