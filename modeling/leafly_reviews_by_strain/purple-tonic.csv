Faux Sheezy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-tonic/reviews/1392992,"“Super sweet fruity smell. Really dense nugs. A decent amount of trichromes. Dark green and purple nug with orange hairs. Really smooth hit and taste. Taste didn’t linger too long. Total creeper, got stuck on stupid for a min. After that I felt very relaxed, no pain.  Kind of tingly. Didn't  feel too social, would rather chill with 1 or 2 friends or alone and listen to music or watch a movie..
I felt pretty euphoric,...”"
