Rendered incommunicado. The tongue was lost; the mind accelerating at warp speed. Glued to one spot listening to to some reggae band but my feet wouldn't stop moving. We are talking FUN!!”"

janet47,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chiquita-banana/reviews/1380918,"“Amazing!! I got mine from Cannacruz with a little over 34% thc. Gives a very nice head buzz, got me giggling at absolutely everything. Highly recommend, this might be my new favorite strain.”"
therothchildstrain,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chiquita-banana/reviews/1360258,"“From stress to depression to a tired body this strain is legit, the smell, smoke, and effects are perfect. The only hiccup is that every breeder seems to have different genetics. Every storefront carries it from a different breeder so I know of at least three crosses all named Chiquita banana however they all test at 31-34% thc I just wish the genetics can be more stable”"

UTOPIA KILLED IT!!

It was this strain that got me hooked on their extracts.
If your dispensary has any concentrates made by UTOPIA, and you have yet to try anything from them, TRY SOME. You will not regret it.

While they do an AMAZING job on all of their concentrates, C. Banana is kind of ...”"

- First session was five hits each. Definitely gave my wife and I a head High. Giggles, excitement, a little hunger and relaxation towards the end. (For the wife it relaxed her enough to put her to sleep.)

- Second session, we went a little harder. Packed the pipe, not sure how many hits but definitely took us sometime to finish the whole bowl. Same effects as previous se...”"

I describe this high to my friends as what my post orgasm bliss feels like. Yup, I went there, but it's true. The strain I tried was "Utopia Chiquita Banana" from Organicann in Santa Rosa. Just one bowl lasts a good hour with an easy chill that doesn't couch lock you but rather makes you remember what it was like to be really happy. Always prone to have great creativ...”"

toofargone,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chiquita-banana/reviews/1345353,"“This has to be the best strain I've ever smoked. 
The buds were cured to perfection. It smoked great and the packaging kept the buds fresh. Utopia Farms deserve a pat on the back. This product is fantastic.”"

dandrews,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chiquita-banana/reviews/1575930,"“I love the smell of sweet bananas when I grind the flowers. Smokes great and is well balanced but acts more towards indica.  Keeps me relaxed, and not very productive.  Recommended.”"

cloud6,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chiquita-banana/reviews/1791512,"“As a chiquita aficionado, I find myself able to rattle off my thoughts and ideas with such relaxed clarity.  Its giggly, uplifting highs fall in line with stoner stereotypes like something out of "That 70's Show," making this one great for depression or those trying to spark a creative thought/source of inspiration.  You will feel energetic and inspired.  Go easy on this heavyweight as it is very strong, though.”"

I’ve only sampled Blue Roots’ version and it’s become a staple of mine-If only it was ever sold in sizes above 1 gram!!! I want to grab a 1/4, but alas, Blue Roots isn’t offering anything other than Lilliputian single grams at the moment. I like mixing this with Doh Si Doh (also Blue Roots), it makes for a wonderf...”"

Bought a eight for 40 bucks alot to spend for me. I got no 🍌 taste at all but it was not bad though, if I try another producer it may have the taste. This 50 indica 50 saliva is exactly what I love the best of both worlds.  A hard core indica and I can't move a hard core saliva and I'm a little wild. By far my favorite. T...”"
