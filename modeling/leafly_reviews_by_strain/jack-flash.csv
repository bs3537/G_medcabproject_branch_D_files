Jack Flash
=============
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-flash/reviews/1395878,"“Went in to pick up Jack Herer and came out with Jack Flash.  It gives a productive high.  Nice in the morning with your coffee.  Energy, focus, lots of smiling and laughing...I've heard there's two versions.  This is the sativa dominant strain and it's wonderful.  I'm actually glad they were out of Jack Herer.   Jack Flash has made my top 10.  I'll be taking him to the beach next week.  He'll make fun....funner.”"

I was fully prepared to go take a nap, but decided to medicate first with some Jack Flash. I got out my rig and did a couple dabs. As I walked back into the kitchen, I saw all the dirty dishes I had planned to put off until later when I was feeling better, and suddenly I found myself washing them. The effects were almost immediate. Nausea was 1000 ti...”"

This could be a 5 star strain if the grower does it right. Beautiful buds, definitely has some skunk in it due to its extreme stickiness. The high is A-1, very calming and uplifting at the same time. The problem I have is the the burn quality and taste are awful, caused by poor flushing. If clean and organic this flower has amazing potential. Grab some JackFlash and give it a ...”"

The combination of sweet aromas with the skunk makes it a typical Haze, which is ideal for my personal needs. I felt very giggly and the only side effect was hardcore cottonmouth.”"

Immediate effects were mellow and calming and kept intensifying for several minutes til it peaked for a great body buzz that lasted roughly 2 and a half hours.

In the case of Jack Flash, they could not be more accurate. The first 15 or so minutes with this strain is intense  - highly energetic, psychedelic even - and always does a good job of locking me in place, completely fascinated with whatever I'm doing or watching that moment. Afterward, the strain settles down into having more of an indica feel. It'...”"

First off this stuff is gorgeous.  It's like the consistency of a soft serve ice cream or cookie dough.

herbanrenewal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-flash/reviews/1374737,"“Definitely one of my all-time favorite strains.  Easy smoke, tastes good, and provides one of the most productive highs for me. It's a steady high that mellows out to a gentle come down. Don't expect to get the mother of all buzzes, but do try this one when you are stressed, have a "block", or just want to get creative.  An added bonus for me is that it also takes the edge off my arthritis pain.”"

Some appetite simulation depending on medical condition type. Works 6/10 for my pain(stronger indica's work better)and not really suggested as best option for digestive/muscle conditions and pains, nor is it ideal for sleep due to its energy. Has a very pleasant, somewhat sweet, but not overpowering aroma. There are mid size trichromes  ...”"

As I'm more of an indica guy but will try hybrids or sativas for day use. This was mid day when I had it. I was uplifted yet relaxed. Helped my back pain and stressing out in general. Great smoke will get more. Only grabbed under 2 grams. Now I know it's good.”"

A bit of indica to give you just a bit of that classic stoned feeling, paired with some great calming sativa genes that can really help with any sort of anxiety issues or mental stress you may be having. It's not going force you to lay down, but it's not going to stop you from doing it either. Great for just about any time of day if you just want to boost your mood.”"
