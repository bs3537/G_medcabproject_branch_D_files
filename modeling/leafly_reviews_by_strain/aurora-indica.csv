Aurora Indica
=============
ObiWanCannabinoid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-indica/reviews/1393511,"‚ÄúMy Aurora Indica was grown from seed in 80/20 Perlite/Vermiculite with an 8 week veg cycle. Each plant was topped once at 4 weeks. 3 plants produced nearly 450g total. Good leaf to bud ratio. Dense bud structure even under a T5. Strong branching required no support. Harvested with cloudy and amber trichomes. Sticky even after months of curing. Gums up a grinder quickly.

With such a generous yield I was able to try c...‚Äù"
GGTBod,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-indica/reviews/1385474,"‚ÄúThis is the perfect Indica, spicy taste bordering on an assault on the sense when you smell your fingers after breaking the buds apart, regularly causing sneasing sessions with the sensory overload, nice but not at the same time.

u4ikRenots,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-indica/reviews/1382211,"‚ÄúOne of the best weeds I've ever smoked for night time. Incredible blueberry taste with a slight musk, this strain relieves my back and neck pain and also helps my stomach calm down. Time slows and you are sweept away to a nice sleep. Relaxing for your body and mind, followed up by feeling super clean the next day.‚Äù"
JboneAK,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-indica/reviews/1393517,"‚ÄúSimply an outstanding Indica, perhaps one of the greatest. Smooth, fuzzy smoke with a subtle fruity piney taste. Immediately makes the brain feel furry and a good stone comes over you after righteous bong rip. I'm currently growing this myself and hope my harvest turns out as exceptional as this particular flower. Highly recommended.  I will be returning to this strain.‚Äù"
MoonGlum,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-indica/reviews/1385475,"‚ÄúVery heavy buzz for first few days until you get used to it!...90% Indica from Nirvana....Dreamy when first smoked...just try to stay awake for a bit until you succumb to the mighty Aurora stream! Peace n Pot -V-‚Äù"
zengrow101,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-indica/reviews/1385476,"‚ÄúThis is the strain I am currently working with in my indoor setup. This plant recovers from well from issues and will on growing as hard as it can. It responds well to both topping and low stress training. To those who like to experiment with defoliation: be prepared to have some some tall plants. The smell is strong, and without proper odor control you could run into some issues if stealth is a concern. I am current...‚Äù"

andrewlutes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-indica/reviews/1382214,"‚ÄúThis is what I grow to relieve MS-related spasticity, and those I share with love the smell of this and more importantly, its action. This is seriously a nighttime strain, though; an outrageous body high, plus complete relaxation and a fantastic night's sleep.‚Äù"
Octans,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-indica/reviews/1385478,"‚ÄúMethod: Glass blunt.  Aurora Indica keeps impressing me more and more.  This was a very fun 10 minute laugh-fest with my little brother and now I'm cruising feeling very good.  I definitely recommend trying this if it's available to you.  Recommended activities: relaxing, talking, hanging out with friends.‚Äù"
Macabre,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-indica/reviews/1385477,"‚ÄúThis strain is very good for those who don't like the psychedelic/head high that sometimes gets you paranoid. All you get with Aurora Indica is a pleasant couchlock effect, with your perception staying clear. Sometimes induces retrospective moods. Very good for insomniacs, as it makes me sleep even if I don't really want to. I wouldn't recommend to watch a movie or anything, since you're most likely to fall asleep (a...‚Äù"

Purple_State_of_Mind,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-indica/reviews/1353160,"‚ÄúThis strain is terribly hard to come by but do not hesitate to pick it up if you're a heavy indica lover. "Aurora Indica" is a perfect name for this mystic, delicious strain. It's more of a sweet/berry indica with earthy undertones than a hashy, spicy indica like some can be.

Had a friend grow this. Didn't yield a lot, first grow. However,it hits nicely, and not too hard at the beginning. There is an everlasting calm about this strain. The best thing about Aurora is the creativity it inspires.. i work like a maniac on this stuff!‚Äù"

Very indica dominate structure with an Afghani appearance that produced huge colas with purple hues long pistols long trichomes sticky buds good for hash but mild with its effects. Relax and chill not very intense.  Good for someone who is sensitive to the effects of cannabis. Just not for me.‚Äù"

Jaypants,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-indica/reviews/1070273,"‚ÄúWow! Very potent strain that will hit you hard. Perfect for insomniacs like myself.
