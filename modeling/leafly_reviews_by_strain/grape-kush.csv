JoshLoc,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/grape-kush/reviews/1397657,"“Got this as a C02 oil, that tests at 80%Thc made by the Quarry, very terpy and tasty. Has really nice kush flavour undertones. Effects wise it's what I love in a good hybrid, a thick cloudy head high comes on right away and within 5-10 mins you slip into a nice kush body high that is sucking you down accompanied by a slight body float. It really is lovely, if I come across this and it has been grown well I will defia...”"

elmofudd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/grape-kush/reviews/1356703,"“One of the few strains that carries no anxiety and no feeling of being unconnected/uncoordinated for me. Great for inward looking, a little energy, and for pleasant body feeling. Low doses are enjoyable that way, with higher doses leading to more sleepiness and more inward looking. Great for music or some videos.”"

Definitely good for a lazy day, but be ready with munchies because this strain will make you eat non stop. It smells amazing and has a great flavor. It takes a few moments to kick in, but when it does it's a hard hitter. definitely one of my go to strains.”"

And as for the body high aspect of it, felt like my skin was made of feathers. Needless to say, I slept better than I have in a while.
