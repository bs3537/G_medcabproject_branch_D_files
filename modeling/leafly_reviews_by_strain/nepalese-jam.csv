Nepalese Jam
=============
GhostOfJack,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nepalese-jam/reviews/1241276,"“Dreadlock buds(foxtails) slight chemy licorice anise with a touch of lime and spice flavor.  light tasting.  very mellow yet uppity buzz sorta like the front end of bluedream with less blueberry ending.  The more ya smoke the more my sample headed in the Nepalese direction.  the more ya smoke the more nepalese temple balls hash flavor comes into play and a heavier overall feeling takes over.”"
KannaKingdom,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nepalese-jam/reviews/1347012,"“Underrated strain - smokes and tastes and reacts like a landrace. Far better genetics than your average hybrid sativa these days. Mountain strain meets Jamaica - match made in heaven.”"
theincredibleodd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nepalese-jam/reviews/1658001,"“i've got to get more of this strain. piney yet tropical smoke. indica side presents throughout the body; good after a long day on your feet. sativa gets you creatively motivated; great for music production or active mind expansion and clarity. get you some!”"
