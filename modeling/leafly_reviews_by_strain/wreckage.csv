It's taste is both sweet and earthy and I'd have to say one of my all-time favorites, Only wish I'd cloned it  :)”"

Smoked out of a bong. On the second bowl... and I'm kinda stoned.

After two puffs on a one hitter, I felt dreamy immediately.  It felt like everyone was walking way slower than I.  After about ten minutes, I had a hard time making decisions...should I go to the bar and have a drink, or should I catch the train?  I took the train and on the escalator ride down, ...”"

Vapescape,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wreckage/reviews/1603256,"“Creates a wonderful creative thinking type of mindset. I love this after a long day of work when I am exhausted but still have tasks to accomplish around the house. It is also great for accommodating your body for when you would like to go to sleep. I often find myself consciously thinking about how soft the blankets are, how warm I am, etc. It puts me right to sleep!”"

DabLifeMayne,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wreckage/reviews/1182557,"“Great strain! Very strong scents of SAGE really piney and high on citrus notes. The toke is nice and smooth and the taste brings more of the trainwreck to play. Nice zest on the exhale really piney.
