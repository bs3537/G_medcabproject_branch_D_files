Dalek,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/canna-tsu/reviews/1386980,"“I have had this strain from four different dispensaries here in Arizona. It has been consistently good from each time I have tried it. I get a very earthy and woodsy exhale, and a soft mental (clear) euphoria and feel my stress and/or anxiety simply melt away.

Harra,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/canna-tsu/reviews/1392454,"“My absolute go-to for pain relief and insomnia. Due to this strain's incredibly high CBD content (9-12%) and low THC content (6-9%), it's an effective source of pain relief and relief from muscle spasms without many psychological effects. In fact, when I vaporize, I don't notice any psychological effects other than being a little more relaxed and less agitated.

This strain is definitely ideal for newer people who mi...”"

I over-indulged in the Canna-Tsu about an hour ago and the effects I'm experiencing are amazing. I'm surprisingly relaxed and the mental clarity and focus I'm experiecing is life-altering. That could just be euphoria doing it's thing, lol.”"
