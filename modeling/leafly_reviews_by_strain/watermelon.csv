Watermelon smell/flavour definitely there.
The euphoria in this strain is intense for an indica. It is uplifting and energizing. I don't feel sleepy and I can do a variety of activities and not feel couch locked. I prefer to use it during the day, not the evening.
I don't really notice the typical indica body effects until the euphoria fully sets in. Once it does it provides me with moderate pa...”"

Days were great as I'd tune in with nature smoking a blunt in the sun, while also providing some fun effects for the night time. Overall a great strain, but I wouldn't recommend buying a lot of it as the taste seemed to drop the more I'd smoke it. Might just be me though.”"

Initially hits you good, and then carries off into a really nice mellow high. 

Found myself relaxed, happy, and somewhat talkative.

Definitely one of the better strains I've tried.”"
