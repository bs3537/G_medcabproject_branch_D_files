Diesel Dough
=============
Ganjafarmer915,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/diesel-dough/reviews/1757775,"“Very uplifting and euphoric strain, thick glistening resinous buds, with amazing aroma and flavor punch the taste is strong of diesel with hints of dough similar to cookies strains. Diesel dough will help you tackle any challenge and have you high as the clouds looking down upon yourself.”"
wayniac917,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/diesel-dough/reviews/1765699,"“Stuff is Awesome. I've had both the flower and the shatter. STINKS! No hiding this strain. The shatter is better IMO, like most. Very euphoric, happy high with no couch lock. Ideal for any time of the day usage. Good for depression, but using too much may end up in dizziness or paranoia. Overall 4.5 out of 5. I really liked it.”"

This is a really nice uplifting strain. Sticky buds are coated with frosty crystals. I just vaped a bowl and I’m feeling good. Feel like I want to get stuff done. Works well on my pain and anxiety.

I tried this strain first in a disposable Rythm pen and it was very nice and made me want to try the flower. Glad I did!”"
