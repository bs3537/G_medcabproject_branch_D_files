hbmoon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-dog-shit/reviews/1360151,"“Also got mine from La Mota in Beaverton. Smells subtly earthy and sweet, had a nice lung crush after a big bong rip, which has been lacking in other top shelf strains lately. Crazy taste! Closest thing I can compare it to is campfire, yet it was still smooth. Good shit.”"

hammerhead12,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-dog-shit/reviews/1567104,"“Daily smoker. usually toke lightly in the morning and heavy at night... Recently I had a day in which I was too busy to toke in the morning, and once I smoked just a tiny joint of this stuff I was gone. Felt like I was 17 again... I’m finding that some of the newer strains being made have this ability to create these insane highs that are reminiscent of my early days of weed... This strain is definitely one of those.”"

This was a very aggressive growing plant and honestly, it does not taste remotely like the name!  Nice relaxing high but doesn't seem particularly  high in THC......could be I need to switch it up some.”"
joekickazz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-dog-shit/reviews/1395696,"“I just got some from a local Nor Cali organic grower and I'm very impressed.  It has the classic purple flavor that is so sought after by outdoor growers.  One of best outdoor strains I've seen in 2017.”"
