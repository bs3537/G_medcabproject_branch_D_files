Frank's Gift
=============
Jellybean213,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1410806,"“When I bit into a York Peppermint Patty... well, okay. When I smoke a bit a Frank's Gift I find I can accomplish almost anything! I've got muscular dystrophy and most of my days are spent in pain waddling around the house. When I use this, I feel fabulous! I was able to prance around the house with the animals like a fool and have a happy little buzz going. Seriously, this is a huge game changer for me. I don't have ...”"
ORBeachnik,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1385666,"“My favorite daytime strain.  I make everclear tinctures for my fibromyalgia. It takes away the muscle spasms and pain but still able to work. Perfect THC/CBD ratio for me. I agree it's a bit hard on the lungs that's why I won't vaporize it. With the tincture it lasts 5-6 hours for a dose of 10 mg THC/21 mg CBD.”"
peacegrrrl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1368032,"“It works well for pain & relaxation. CBD strains are not made to get you high. They are made for pain, anxiety, and other medical uses. They help calm any anxiety brought on by THC. I really like Frank's Gift as a CBD strain.”"
jediduck,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1383687,"“This is by FAR the best CBD strain I have ever tried. As a medical patient I have tried almost every cbd strain there is. Franks Gift takes away almost all my pain when my body is hurting. The cbd to thc ratio is perfect for me. other Cbd strains with no or little thc don't help my pain at all but Franks Gift has me feeling good again everytime. Glad I am in Oregon where it can be found!!”"
westonde,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1410807,"“I've always had issues with anxiety and paranoia with weed. Not with this beautiful strain! 4-5 hits and I'm numb of pain and feeling oh so good. Got major munchies on the Come down, but I guess that's just a normal weed thing! Ha!”"
GrapesonGrapesonGrapes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1394320,"“An awesome CBD dominant strain, that's great for pain, anxiety, and relaxation. I've seen cuts of this flower posting some extraordinary stats of cbd levels of about 16-20% and a nice moderate level of thc around the 8-10%. It provides a very pleasant relaxing body buzz almost immediately. Great daytime smoke. The buds were a bit fluffy and long. The color was a deep emerald green with bits of light sandy colored cal...”"
seanzy84,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1678485,"“tested at 13.82% CBD and 8.82% THC. obtained from Seven Clover in Albuquerque NM for $6 a gram got an 1/8 to test out. typical smell and taste for a cbd dominant strain, very earthy, piney, with a slight sweet smell. very nice meds for anxiety, stress, or pain. one of the better cbd strains I've tried so far and mixes well into high thc strains for a little extra relief from life's worries.”"
kaychristine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1410808,"“Frank's gift is a new found favorite for me. The high comes on gently, is long lasting and does wonders for pain, anxiety and bowel spasms. With high cbn's, cbg's, cbd's and mild thc the high is mellow, giggly, and truly enjoyable. Would reccomend to anyone looking for relief with pain, stress, or restlessness.”"
sourcactus93,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1364414,"“I have a low THC tolerance so this strain has a tendency to get me a little too high if I don't watch how much I'm smoking. It's great for smoking and sinking into your couch while you wait for the pizza delivery to show up. It's a little hard to stay focused on something, it's a great strain to watch a comedy or outrageous youtube videos, nothing too complex. I wouldn't say I get the munchies, I just need something ...”"
Spookaloo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1469758,"“I use marijuana to relieve multiple sclerosis symptoms, and because of the high CBD content in this strain it works super well. It completely stopped spasticity, muscle spasms, nerve pain and a bad headache. If you are medicating for pain and not looking for a stratospheric high, this is your strain.”"
Huntersilas,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1367716,"“I think my tolerance is too high to be high after smoking this strain, but it did instantly relieve some really bad back pain that I have. It also leaves you with a nice vibe in your body, and keeps the head clear which is nice. But if you wanna get stoned, roast a bowl of this mixed with something that has a bunch of THC in it and you'll feel great!”"
ositaartista,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1590968,"“Was recommended for the high CBD ratio for my arthritis but this strain triggers migraines - aura and all. I think it's worth a try if you've got really bad pain but just know that if you're prone to migraine with aura, this could be a bad strain for you!”"
A.Grimm,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1364665,"“Made me vomit every time I took a hit. Tried over different days and even with just a little I was vomiting.”"
DicentraSalix,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1347863,"“I loved it. It decreased my pain so well I got up to clean and craft. My hunny had some too and his back pain subsided drastically. I will be looking for this strain available near me and would grow this in the future.”"
PineappleScott,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1576517,"“Frank's Gift indeed. 

           I chose this strain because if the 2:1 CBD|THC ratio and because it sounded like an off shoot of " Ringo's Gift " which is my favorite CBD Strain to date. 

       Frank's Gift smelled a little sour but not unpleasant and had a very light sage aroma. Although I know grows will vary , I must say - This was one of the most beautiful buds I had laid eyes on in awhile. Very dense and cov...”"

RSTindle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1515823,"“Nice skunky smell.   Harsh exhale.  Immediately felt head buzzy.  Pain and anxiety melted away.  A lot of pain I endure from FMS everyday was gone.  I realized at that point my usual brain fog was lifted and I had no inflammation.  Why we prescribe opioids is beyond me.   This strain is the prototype for pain and anxiety relief.  I imagine it works for PTSD because I wasn’t jumpy at all.  An all over sense of well be...”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1498247,"“We're heavy smokers, averaging 6 grams a day, and we smoke to get high. I also suffer from a lot of anxiety, so I love finding a strain with some cbd. Frank's Gift is absolutely wonderful... my ladyfriend and I both get a little high, very relaxed, face melty and then, zzzzzz. It's one of our favorite bedtime smokes. Also great if I'm anxious and want to keep a clear head. Just... great. Love it. As other reviewers h...”"

jimispier,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1619891,"“This strain produced a deep, focused high and allowed me to play video games with my wife without being mental. I'm a huge fan of high CBD strains. This one definitely is among one of my top choices. Nice warm feeling across my chest, a nice slight daze (with no couchlock), I'm able to focus and enjoy the buzz instead of being a drooling zombie for 2-3 hours. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone wanting to kic...”"

I have tremors that are well taken care of with some strains and this one isn’t quite as good as others but a very enjoyable none the less”"

flamingtrash,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1687672,"“Frank’s gift is excellent for anxiety and pain. It’s a strain I always keep in my medicine cabinet because it gives me pain relief without hindering my ability to work. I’m usually a two-hitter-quitter with most flower, but it usually takes me about 7 or 8 hits of Frank’s Gift, if not more, to hit a good level of pain and anxiety relief. Still, I like it better than most other medicinal strains.”"
Voileen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1615653,"“I absolutely love Frank's Gift. I live in Eugene, OR where my grower actually knows the guy that started this strain. They grow large amounts of it and I have recently started using it myself. I use Marijuana purely for medicinal purposes to treat Ankyloding Spondytis, Lupus, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I can't tolerate high THC during the daytime very well due to my intense fatigue. Franks Gift is a perfect daytim...”"

Tripleek,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1379552,"“A mellow body numb, with a mild mood enhancement. After several uses I have come to the conclusion that this strain causes me sinus issues including massive sinus headaches for days after.”"

mamamarijuana1118,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1653130,"“I am actually super disappointed in this strain. I am not 100% sure if it was just a bad batch but the high was weak... Sunshine Tiki Hut was the brand and/or grower. I recommend it for the CBD aspect but NOT for the high.”"

Beccababy73,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1287840,"“I found this to be somewhat unexceptional. I needed a high CBD flower for medical reasons, and to be honest, the taste made me gag and dry heave.
It took almost 3/4 of a joint to even feel any relief, and I am a new smoker.
It tasted like pure Pine sol on the exhale.
It also caused deep, heavy lung spasms.
I have had better.”"

DanAshFan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/franks-gift/reviews/1415638,"“I was looking to buy Ringo’s Gift to potentially treat my Ménière’s disease when I accidentally bought Frank’s Gift instead. The THC level was only 5% and the CBD’s were off the charts. For that reason I used a whole lot of it and it hit me like a bomb. I have never experienced such a bizarre strain. I had wild mood swings, mild disorientation. The effects were strange and trippy in a way that I have never experience...”"
