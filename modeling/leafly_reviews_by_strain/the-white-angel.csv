I was going through about an 8th every two days of various indica strains but this one does it for me. If i could find some seeed i'd grow some”"

If flowers still get you stoned then the concentrate is most definitely going to be too much for you to handle but if you are a connoisseur with a high tolerance and ONLY vape/dab concentrates then you should be fine...I know I was :-)”"
Freddyfoxx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-white-angel/reviews/1420840,"“One of the most potent and aromatic strains I have ever smoked. The strain made DJ Pooh and Snoop to crazy. They smoked this strain ONLY during the live taping of the Pharmacy with Dr. Dre, Snoop and DJPooh. This strain was the reason behind the Abracadabra movie and release by Brass Knuckles. The strain was not commercially available to be released to be able to sustain such a roll out. Get it if you can find it”"
