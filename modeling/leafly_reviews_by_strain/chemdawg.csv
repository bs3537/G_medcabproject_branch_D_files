If I was high on this all day I wouldn't have to even have to waste money and time through insurance companies that are connected to Pharma. It's amazing to smoke, it helps you clear your head, and it takes away your pain and anxiety/paranoia.”"

We prepared food for a little shindig we're havin tomorrow night. We had such a nice time cutting vegetables, listening to some reggae classics and just having some cool ass moments being together. You might really enjoy simply being with some of your favorite peeps in some mundane situation...with Chemdawg.”"

Don't ...”"

Feeling euphoric, happy, creative, no stress, no depression.

My pain is gone, completely. My hands do not lock when I close them. (Huge for me.)

The nugs, which I got from SpoCannabis in Spokane, are dense, tight, super-frosty, and so covered with orange hairs that each bud appears to have patches of orange interspersed with the frosty green. I'm freaking in...”"

For me the stone was very intense, almost hallucinogenic in its effect. I was couchlocked but not from a body high, an over stimulation of the sense left me on the couch. The wonderment of the world around me was almost too much. If it were highschool and I was only smoking to get as stoned as possible (not that there is anything wrong with that AT AL...”"
