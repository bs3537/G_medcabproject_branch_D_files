I gently break the buds apart into tinier bowl-sized budlets with two pairs of tweezers, to keep the magic dust away from my fingers.  The first hit drives deep into the muscles of my face, numbing them and and shaping my features into a wide grin.   I let the smoke expand within my chest until I cannot hold it any longer, and a...”"

Smell was mellow, not very loud at all, and was sweet and earthy like petrichor.  The flavor when burned was harsher than expected, but not unpleasant.
Effects were almost entirely cerebral, providing noticeable mental stimulation and a focused creativity energy, making it perfect for reading an...”"

The smell is definitely reminiscent of cream, but it’s also fruity and earthy. The THC clocks in at 28.6% and the buds are rounded; orange hairs and loads of crystals. I struggle with chronic insomnia and I’m always looking for a good indica that can help put me out, i can see this strain helping down the road.  5/5 XTREME”"

It's a 70/30, which isn't too strong for me, for what I need for sleep. It certainly crushed my chronic back pain, which was at 10 on the pain scale.
