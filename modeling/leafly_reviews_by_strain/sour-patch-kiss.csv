Qman1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-patch-kiss/reviews/1414100,"“This hybrid is definitely a great one to pick up. This sativa dominant  strain cures any ailments that you have. Highly suggested that you take small doses of this strange, a little goes s long way. Will either have you energetic, focused and creative or lethargic...it's totally your choice with this strain 👍.”"
JourneyAlee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-patch-kiss/reviews/1384278,"“Let's put it this way: I was only able to buy this strain two times, but it remains on my list of Top 5 Best Strains of all time, and I still ask for it specifically every time I go to the dispensary. Tangy citrusy/earthy flavor with rapid, full-involvement high that lasts about an hour. Smooth smoke; not at all harsh, but wow, is it potent! This strain is especially good for headaches caused by migraine, stress, or ...”"
CO26,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-patch-kiss/reviews/1392038,"“This is a very fun smoke. Has a slight citrus taste to it. It was a great high. Cereberal high like an indica, but the energy and creativity of a sativa. Super relaxed, fun but product strain”"

Tropical303,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-patch-kiss/reviews/1423900,"“Very head heavy to start then creeps to your toes and fingers. Mind became very focused and clear with a body of jello. Great for movies 🤙🏼”"

She tastes like Sour Diesel candy on the inhale, and on the exhale she leaves an OG Kush flavour that just sticks around! Kush Gardens hooked it up too with an ounce for $150 HUGE buds too!”"
IrishBear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-patch-kiss/reviews/1399414,"“Kept me focused and going on tasks, all while feeling mellow yet energized. A good smoke, whether after work or for a wake-n-bake, it has no tired feeling or headache while coming down, nor is there any cottonmouth effect. Got me where I wanted to be all while being functional and productive.”"

Using currently for a stomic ache and doing the job. Not too much of a head rush tho even out the bong nothing to crazy just a good relaxing stain.”"

Dankgrower,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-patch-kiss/reviews/1628769,"“Just downright amazing ,I just grew this strain. I am not even a Indica type of person, but I love this strain, though it takes more of its Indica lineage when it comes to the high and effects! It absolutely offers clear-headed thinking and creativity as with sativas, just awesome and it looks beautiful!”"

Cassidilla,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-patch-kiss/reviews/1651117,"“The high that I got from this strain was great! It made me want to get up and dance to some tunes. When I went to the arcade bar in my town with my friends, I smoked a bowl before going and it made me super focused on the games. I ended up winning a couple of games too because of it haha.
The only thing I didn't enjoy was when I was coming down off the high; I would get dizzy and have a headache along with it. I've s...”"

I was starting to think it was gonna be some weak stuff, but the high just kinda settles in. Just hanging out on the porch after a decent day and I'm feeling awesome. And I still have half a bowl left.”"
AnonymousPanda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-patch-kiss/reviews/1755930,"“My FAVORITE strain!! Amazing sour sweet smell, taste that is sour and citrusy at first, and finishes sweet. Like sour patch kids. It’s fucking phenomenal.

The high is immediate. Clear headed but relaxed and happy. Very smiley. My creative juices are flowing and i am focused. Love this strain for day use when out in the nature!”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-patch-kiss/reviews/1490980,"“Sour patch kiss would be like getting a little passed first base then getting tagged out. SPK should be aka as p-23 then.

Looks bright tight and frosty. Gives way to name sake paired with the aroma of lightly sweet with citrus, gas, hints of wood, and flowers. Tastes lightly sweet and little skunky. Effects are quick with a short burst of slight euphoria and intense focus. Relaxation fades in as focus fades out a li...”"
