Loud Lemonade

cosmicdesert,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/loud-lemonade/reviews/1703144,"“Really good strain that’s inexpensive at most dispensaries. Gets you ripped and you stay up for much longer than a lot of other strains. It’s dank bud that hits you like a wave of chill. You’re relaxed, content, & talkative. You can get things done because you feel euphoric but not sleepy. Your body will feel as if it is floating on air.”"
