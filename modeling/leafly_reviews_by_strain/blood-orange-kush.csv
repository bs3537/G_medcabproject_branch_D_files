Manymoonsago,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blood-orange-kush/reviews/1569717,"“This strain is incorrectly named.  It should really be called One Hit Wonder. The effects are immediate and long lasting.  This is a sipper with a bright sorta “spicy” feeling. There is definitely an energy to overall effect. My description isn’t doing it justice. One tip— after administering this strain...don’t make plans.”"

Blackdogrising,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blood-orange-kush/reviews/1694057,"“As a daily regular user, it’s hard to really blow me away with anything new, but this one is one of the best new strains I’ve tried since super lemon haze.   Head high and not and not a chair melter in the least.    This is a rock picking, dog walking, swimming, golfing, etc high.    Not that you need it to enjoy those things, but enhance them, for sure as my dog is licking himself right now.   And he is.    Cause he...”"

Davidpnin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blood-orange-kush/reviews/1496696,"“A nice ass-kicker.  This strain has a definite Sativa kick to it but it's not overwhelming.  I'm much more of an Indica man but this is a fun hybrid.  It's really spacey and relaxing with moments of focus.  Definitely makes me happy and numb.  All my space hoe's need to try it.”"
Fluffyweedy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blood-orange-kush/reviews/1732581,"“This is my go to when I have a blasting migraine. The kind of migraines that leave you in the fetal position, crying, no lights, no noise, even breathing hurts. 

I smoke a little of this and with in 30 min, most of my headache is lifted. It helps with the nausea, helps dull the pain and makes me so sleepy that I can sleep with out an ice pack on my head. 

Mine is home grown and I use it sparingly. Only for migraine...”"

blue_siren,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blood-orange-kush/reviews/1658571,"“While this strain would probably be great for those taking medication or have conditions which cause lack of appetite, I would not recommend this for someone looking to get high. The munchies with this strain is crazy!”"
