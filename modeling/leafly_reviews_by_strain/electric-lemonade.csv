I prefer a good rolled joint experience and this does not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and give this a try.

It provides a euphoric mental feeling and a tingly body buzz making this a really good daytime use strain if you are at home and want to get things done. I would not recommend using this when working as it does make you feel "stoned." Overall a great starin and I would definitely recommend it for pain relief.”"

It’s smells like a lemon head, super lemony which perks you up. I appreciate this strain greatly and look forward to indulging everyday!”"

This is a heavy hitter because of the Tahoe OG, one of the strongest strains. The taste is lemonade with some blue dream! The strongest Indica-like Sativa I've ever had. Very interesting strain that is a must try!”"
