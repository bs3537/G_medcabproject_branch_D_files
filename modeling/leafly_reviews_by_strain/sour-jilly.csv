I have fibromyalgia and I seek out this strain specifically for both its mental and physical effects.”"

One toke in the AM and I am sent on a trip of happy, uplifted and giggly. I could not stop smiling and even laughing. I am also able to stay alert and focus during school with this strand. One bowl lasts 3 solid hours with waves on euphoria!”"
Froggeth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-jilly/reviews/1413114,"“Tastes sweet and tropical, reminiscent of the Fruity Pebbles strain, little unfocused and very relaxed. Doesn't make you sleepy but can help ease you into a nice sleep if you're tired. 

Grabbed a 500mg GoldDrop cartridge from Cookies SF, after a few hits I feel like I'm resting on a nice cloud of relaxation. At 66% THC content, this cartridge is not for the novice consumer unless small quantities are taken at a time...”"

VegVet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-jilly/reviews/1413117,"“It's my favorite so far. My neck jerks violently from my tbi and this is a strain that does away with it almost completely. To the point no one notices. It keeps me stimulated at school, makes me far more sociable. It takes care of my ptsd as well, I never have a rage episode while medicated with this. It's great on my nerve pain and my elbow which the tendon is calcified. I would love to start growing this one for m...”"

It puts me in the perfect headspace to be a good mom. One small hit and for most of the day I have energy, and a good attitude. I can sit and play with my kid happily without feeling anxious about whatever else I need to do. Helps me to be very present.”"
