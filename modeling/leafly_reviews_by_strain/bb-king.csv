TedIn3dee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bb-king/reviews/1360035,"“B B King is a KOBE strain.B B will have you jamming and relaxing like John Coltrane or Miles Davis seeing musical notes in your sleep.Very Indica dominant just a slight cerebral to her.Buds were golf ball and smell so floral,pungent and skunky.Dont take much to put you on your az like GG or 9 pound hammer.Great for sleep and pain munchies will run your night stock up before indulging.”"
sonotkyle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bb-king/reviews/1412220,"“This is a violent strain. With amazing citrusy taste and a heavy hit . This stuff will get you motivated on a few hits but can put you out for the count.”"
natspate,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bb-king/reviews/1360034,"“This strain tastes amazing while vaped. It doesn't have a strong smell and the high is long lasting and intense. I really like it when I am chilling out watching movies or cleaning the house. I only like it for hermit days at home. It's not good for out in public as it comes with a bit of paranoia and the dry mouth is horrible. You will want to have a lot of water and a bathroom near by.”"
DrShevek,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bb-king/reviews/1353742,"“A great Indica. there's a little energy if you take a small hit. but a regular dose will put you into full sleepy time mode. a nice high, a mellow body relaxation. I really enjoy it.”"

ManiacMarQ03,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bb-king/reviews/1586059,"“The look was interesting at first. Thought it was like blueberry until you look closer. Totally a mind relaxer. Wrote a song and took care of some house duties that has been long over-due. That was all in a couple of days after trying it. Great stuff 👌🏾”"
