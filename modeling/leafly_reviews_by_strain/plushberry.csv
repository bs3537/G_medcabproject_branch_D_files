joAmo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/plushberry/reviews/1312384,"“Plushberry, being a indica dominant brings the perks of having a relax, stoney feeling of wanting to adjust accordingly alongside tasks, coffee, and errands. Tastes, sweet and berry like. Increments of two to three hour sessions, sometimes five to six hours of not having the urge of wanting to smoke again. Great flower to inhale, as an in between or individually. This ranks on the low end of a four star because of th...”"

Very relaxing, paranoia doesn't even exist. A little purple in it to make you smile. Wouldn't recommend if you need to be awake all day. Nice for a bed time smoke.”"
WhiteAfrikanz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/plushberry/reviews/1149589,"“One of the most fruitful and well developed strains. One of my top 3 without a doubt. Amazing taste, as well as smell. Enjoyable Indica high, without putting you straight to sleep. Favorite strain for after a long day looking to relax and unwind.”"
cascadianmass,https://www.leafly.com/indica/plushberry/reviews/1190359,"“Not the greatest strain, but very aromatic. The smoke was kind of foul, unless I rolled it up in a joint. Other patients have noticed that when a bowl of Plushberry is smoked right before a bowl of L.A. Confidential, a complete pain relief effect is achieved after both bowls.  For that, it's stars got bumped up.  Normally this should be a very fruity bud.”"

Not too much to where you're glued to the couch but just enough to where when you stand you get that little head rush while going to the fridge for some munchies. I recommend it. Sort of reminds me of a pink Starburst, as far as flavor goes.”"

Just the usual 15 seconds low intensity anxiety to start with. Low intensity dizziness. Then a moderate couchlock. That's it! No relaxation or calmness. No mind or body high.

The next day I felt so sleepy, snoozed my alarm and next thing I know is it's 12 noon when I wake up.

The effects last for...”"

Maybe this is a strain best for beginners or its just not for me. But I did give strain ample try.”"
