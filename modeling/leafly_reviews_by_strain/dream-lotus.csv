Dream Lotus

KakashiHatake,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1373117,"“Recently I was diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder, and this strain helps a lot of the symptoms I experience (some in my previous review), but I had never known what they all meant. I am a high functioning autistic and anxiety, odd mood changes, and uncomfortable social interactions are a daily occurrence for me. I smoked Dream Lotus before, and during a five mile hike recently, and it made me feel extremely m...”"
ShadyImage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1552895,"“This is quite honestly one of the best strains I've ever had. I suffer from very bad Generalized Anxiety Disorder, mild depression and chronic fatigue/lethargy (likely due to lack of exercise). The high itself is amazing as it comes part from blue dream (top 5 favorite). Makes me very happy and best of all ACTUALLY makes me energetic. This is one of the FEW strains that I've found to work wonders for my above symptom...”"
lroyale,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1518176,"“Dream Lotus is the best kush I've ever smoked.
Seriously. I have been smoking weed for a very long time since high school, tasted all kinds of kush and I've never tried anything so perfect. If you have been smoking or smoked before then you have definitely heard of a weed strain called : blue dream. Blue Dream is the basic kind of weed for anyone with any problems or for recreation;

 Beginners, expert, psychological...”"

Doesn't make you wanna sleep necessarily but could help ease the mind before bed. Vanilla and blueberry notes, vanilla hit me first then blueberry. Hashy taste leftover. Buds are dense but not as dense as a sour diesel. Buds are fat and trichomey. B+ rating from me
Like the stress relieving body balancing aspect most good for meditation & re...”"
silentmania,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1223585,"“I took one good bong rip and blasted off without really noticing. I picked up my phone and responded to some texts. Ten minutes later, I realize I'd been smoking, looked at my bong and realized there was pretty much a whole bowl left. Smoked the rest, played Doom 3 for a few hours, laid down in my bed and conked the f*** out and woke up at 8am after a full night's sleep. 

Find it. Smoke/vape it. Love it.”"

CheechedGiant,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1223947,"“It is a hybrid of Blueberry and Blue Dream and this Dream Lotus holds up to the reputation of smoothness.  I could take the most massive hits I have ever taken with this strain.  If dried properly the smell will bloom into the fresh-like smell that stimulate the nostrils.”"
infinidro,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1199416,"“Solid 4 for this one. Nice strain for the afternoon, but it doesn't get you a soaring high nor does it get you a nice body buzz--more often it's just a nice little high, pleasant but not overwhelming. If you're looking for something functional, this is a good choice. Otherwise, you might be better off with a more powerful sativa, a more chill indica, or a more better hybrid.”"
JDP420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1229940,"“Flavor nice and the flower was cultivated great... nice and dense burned forever. Great buzz, light body high with a nice euphoric mental buzz. Great for that happy place feeling..”"
Bd_princess,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1396013,"“Picked this up by surprise. Never tried it. Love blue dream and this is close friend to BD. Pleasantly euphoric and got rid of my headache! Yay for dream lotus.”"

JBI800,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1216328,"“Pleasant but light head high. Nice if you want something mild. Calming but not sedating. However, head effect are a little short-lived so be prepared to take several doses if you need something that lasts.”"

Smells like Fruity Pebbles.”"

ThePorgAwakens,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1735102,"“This one is only okay for me and I probably wouldn't buy it again. It didn't really uplift my mood, if anything it moved me from depression to melancholy. It leaves me feeling slightly relaxed with an edgey/anxious/annoyed feeling. Doesn't help with my physical pain but did help my nausea.”"
Gandler,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1793168,"“This strain was an extremely disappointing add-on to my dispensary visit in Leicester. The buds looked fine and dandy, tasted pretty good, but an entire eighth of this strain failed to get me high. The noticeable effects included a distinct lack of munchies, a slightly tired feeling, sore throat from non-stop vaping, and a sour feeling that will linger for far longer than any buzz. 

It may be because (somehow) the p...”"

StateofMorgan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1367621,"“"Dream" is right. This is not an out-in-public weed. Very cerebral, makes me super spacey, one of those where you suddenly realize you've been staring at the wall for 20 minutes thinking barely coherent thoughts. Pleasant enough, but I can get the overall relaxing effects from other strains without the fog. If you do focus on a task, you can get shit done, but don't expect to have a conversation doing it. Don't expec...”"

toxxn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-lotus/reviews/1341566,"“Blue dream similarities are very minimal. 
Smell: Slightly sour, with a slight pungent fruit aroma. No hints of bluedream at all, no blue composition at all. Smell was not chemical or jet fuely at all. Also lacked any traces of durban. 
Taste was smooth, sour, with a higher note to the taste. It definitely can't be considered sweet in any capacity. There were more hints of the snow lotus. No Blue or durban taste what...”"
