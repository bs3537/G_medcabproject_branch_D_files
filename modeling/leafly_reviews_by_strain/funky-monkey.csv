This is a very relaxing and mellow strain that provides good pain relief. Best used in the evening maybe a couple of hours before retiring since it is not immediately sedating. I love it for the pain and stress relief. An excellent strain :o)”"

Perfect for parties. I couldn't stop dancing even when there wasn't any music playing. If music did play, it sounded so good to my ears. I got so creative I could create my own songs inside my head while dancing to it. Also made me talkative. No anxiety. 
It also took away the severe pain of my right hip.
