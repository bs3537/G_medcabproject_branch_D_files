I tried an extract in a g-pen and the flavor was as stated, smokey, piney, and woody. Burnt Cedar almost. No paranoia, but rather feelings of safety and comfort. Happy and euphoric. Laughing tremendously and creative enough to leave my 1st comment on leafy.”"
CatsAndCrows,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-dragon/reviews/1417130,"“I really like Green Dragon for the stress relief (as well as calming my anxiety). It doesn't offer as much in the way of sleepiness (which is one aspect I look for in Indicas), but it is so effective in calming my nerves that I am able to relax. It is harder for me to use this strain during the day, however, because it does tend to zone me out, which is a welcome feeling before bed, but not so much during the day. Th...”"
georgiae,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-dragon/reviews/1372518,"“Green Dragon is the best strain I have ever tried and as a Medical Marijuana patient I have tried many! This doesn't feel like an indica at all. It is uplifting and gives you so much energy. I have had so many fun times with this strain. It's great for exploring new cities and spending time with friends. I also like it because I can still think clearly when I smoke it! Totally recommend!”"

Now that I've smoked all three (not in one sitting -- three seshes over a couple of weeks) -- I can say that I have never smoked anything quite like green dragon. 

This weed smells very strongly. Simply opening up a doob tube with a joint in it made my whole room smell like weed. It's a nice  smell, though. Sweet, hashy and spicy...”"

ag3100,https://www.leafly.com/indica/green-dragon/reviews/1545109,"“(concentrate) Green Dragon is really nice. unlike a lot of people who commented, I find that I'd rather be bundled up in bed after smoking this, with a snack planned later. I smoked too much once and had some anxiety, but I put on crashing-ocean-waves sound and I felt better. doesn't help me sleep, bit makes me feel more relaxed before I do fall asleep on my own. Maybe it's just me but I need a decent number of hits ...”"

Got me next with it's sweet, minty, skunky, & pine smells & tastes. Strain has more CBD then most nearing 2%. Uplifted, happy, & dizzy effects at first followed by calm, lazy, relaxation.

This is my favorite type of high.  I'm very happy, very euphoric and dancing around and singing.  I'll clean the windows, listening to music, and cook.  

This is very much like Green Goddess flower where you want to be dancing and singing up-beat.

Highly recommend to get things done and you have a very clear head at the same time.”"

Odd that for an indica that it doesn't make me sleepy. Maybe the dose was low (few drops of tincture in alcohol).”"

For occasional users this strain is cool for a quick smoke.”"

The body high is quite nice, it's like having a warm puppy in your lap - a slight weight feeling on your chest you don't want to disturb. Hint of mint lingers on the tongue.
