Claims are to be extremely potent, but I can tell the difference from other 20 ish strains. Tastes are pretty subtle, but maybe I need to clean my pipe. Smoke definitely leaves a good after taste, and expands when hits the lungs. Good for pain! I would give this a 4.5/5 but that's not an option! This ran me about 20 more than Golden Goat, but I def prefer the GG. Overall...”"
