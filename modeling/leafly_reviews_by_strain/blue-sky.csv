So I picked up an eighth not knowing what to expect. What initially attracted me to blue sky was "bag appeal". Very frosty dense nugs. Full trichrome heads. Light green bud with light orange hairs. Its been a while but I remember it smelling and tasting very "fresh" and piney, almost floral. No skunk. One Saturday afternoo...”"

Maybe their blue sky is different, but this stuff is pure love. Very calming, but yet so happy. Can't stop smiling.”"
shhurricane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-sky/reviews/1350935,"“VERY BALANCED STRAIN, IT LEANS MORE TOWARDS THE INDICA SIDE. HIGH IS VERY MELLOW AND RELAXING, BUT WONT COUCH LOCK YOU. HONESTLY, WHAT SOLD ME ABOUT THIS STRAIN IS THE LOOKS AND SMELL OF THE BUD.  AWESOME BLUE LOOKING LEAVES AND COATED IN TRI-CHROMES. TASTE ON THIS STRAIN IS TOP NOTCH.. 5 STARS !”"
shhurricane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-sky/reviews/1357651,"“This strain is awesome. The first thing I would like to point out is that it is a very smooth smoking bud with flavorful aroma's. Very mellow and relaxed high, a good daytime strain.”"

Zeriajo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-sky/reviews/1390905,"“It works for me! This strain is good for making you feel relaxed and uplifting at the same time. It has an earthy flavor and a good aroma. It's like being on cloud 9!”"
shhurricane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-sky/reviews/1280353,"“This is definitely a hybrid but leaning more on the indica side. very mellow high and the bud has interesting looking colors that stand out.”"
Earthworth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-sky/reviews/1257365,"“When at my local dispensary I decided I was going to go with a hybrid in addition to my regular (top shelf OGkush). I did not do my research on this strain until later. Upon seeing and smelling these sweet buds, I assumed I was handling a blueberry/skywalker cross. As I started breaking the flowers, and grinding them i thought to myself, there was something mysterious about this strain. Turns out it was an LSD/Rocky ...”"

ralexander89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-sky/reviews/1356938,"“Finally found my strain! It's so unfortunate that it's rarely in stock in LA it's the perfect chill philosophical laughing flower. Foood tastes super better and music has new meaning. Highly recommend for unwinding and finding joy.”"

LemonDrops,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-sky/reviews/1493810,"“Quickly became one of my favorite strains. I have a lot of issues that I turn to MM for, and this strain fixes almost all of them at once. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, pain, and vertigo all vanished at once. I felt super uplifted and every song I listened to felt incredible and I could feel a warm tingle go through my body with the music. Plus, sex was great. 100% recommend”"

srubek,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-sky/reviews/1284851,"“Actually a big fan of this one. No nausea anymore, no stomach cramps. No vertigo. No blah blah blah that comes with IBS. And depression gently lifted while smoking a joint with a buddy. More so than blue dream does. I would say this does--for depression--what blue dream does--for stress.”"

BlasianFranky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-sky/reviews/1298530,"“This indica lean hybrid actually put me in quite the couch lock of an indica and with the creativity of a sativa. This for me was too intense and sedative. I was relaxed, then anxious, then relaxed, and it goes on. None the less, this is something that an indica fan would love in my opinion.”"
