Cinderella 99
=============
Kimmiko,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderella-99/reviews/1398480,"“I truly believe that this "Cinderrella 99" is the best Hybrid Sativa I have ever had.  I love the high.  Very euphoric, yet at the same time you can get a good amount of things done.  And at the same time I can think clearly too.  A great day buzz for the busy!  Mind you though, take it easy.  A little goes along way!  And I find that helpful with my budget.  All in all it makes for a very Happy High! :)))”"

Strangely, I can type faster on this strain.  Walking around, I felt taller!  A weird effect.  After awhile,  you"ll want to dance around the room.  I actually feel like exercising.....a rare occurrence.”"

Currently this is my favorite "active" strain to medicate with; I've tried green crack, atf, Jack H., Sour D, Super S.D., and a few other Sativa/Sativa-dominants, and the reason why this is my favorite has to be the amount of focus that comes with it.

Finally tried some from Helping Hands dispensary. I do NOT find it to be racy. CIndy 99 feels more like a well balanced hybrid albeit on the more uplifting side. I'll describe this using two adjectives: UPLIFTED & RELAXED. Also, GOOD FOR PAIN. A really FUNCTIONAL STRAIN. Cheers!”"
