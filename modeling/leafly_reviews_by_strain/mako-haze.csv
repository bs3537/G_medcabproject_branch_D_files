patrickbasler@snet.net,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mako-haze/reviews/1332086,"“Mako haze was a pretty good bud, and could be useful for patients with depression because it got me up and going, with a rush of energy from the first hit. The high was similiar to sour diesel. The high lasted about 2 hours with an hour comedown afterwards. When smoked in excess this strain got me high as fuck.”"

BioGirl3,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mako-haze/reviews/1061683,"“I really liked how i was functional during the day but still had relief. Plus it didn't make me appear high at all. I liked how focused I was and how much it helped me finish a term paper.”"
blczer0,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mako-haze/reviews/1332087,"“Pretty great strain. If you smoke a little bit, it'll provide a nice energetic high that eases your mind. If you smoke a lot, prepare to be really.. really high.”"
bartist,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mako-haze/reviews/1332088,"“I'm going to say this was a nice heavy hitting strain for me. No couch lock, but extremely spacey for the first couple of minutes! Mako Haze amazed!”"
Phenom,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mako-haze/reviews/1061677,"“It was a decent pick-me-up. I found that the strain makes thoughts hazy, which I do not like. Perhaps I am looking for a more energetic high”"
Pulsipher,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mako-haze/reviews/1297662,"“Tried the BHO wax of this strain and found it is a great daytime sativa. Very energetic and creativity-inducing. Personally, I find it helpful to increase my focus when working on a particular task. Produces a calm, cool and collected state for me. I would DEFINITELY  get this again in the future.”"

budgetgrow,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mako-haze/reviews/1427859,"“I grow this strain. It is one of my favorites. We describe it as concert weed. It's a long lasting high that comes in waves. Every 10 minutes the high is different, just lapping at your feet like the ocean.  It is perfect for listening to music because it allows your mind to wander and truly appreciate the show while not knocking you out. It is a long flower but well worth the time. I flower for about 110 days on ave...”"

zellerpress,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mako-haze/reviews/1377199,"“This is one of my go-to strains for depression. It works amazingly well at boosting my mood and helping me be productive. I was hesitant at first because I also deal with anxiety, but I'm happy to report this didn't cause any issues with anxiety like some sativas can. 

The buds smell like lemons and pine in the best way possible. Keef-y buds with bright orange hairs. Delicious and smooth to smoke.”"

swaggsyahir,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mako-haze/reviews/1061672,"“Was surprised to see an $8/g 25% THC strain listed at a local dispensary, so I was quite curious to try it. It looks and smells great however the taste is less distinct to other strains. Burns and hits you quite fast.”"
Phenom,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mako-haze/reviews/1225358,"“Sweet smelling and yielding frosty and hairy nugs.

After vaping, felt very relaxed and calm. This strain helps me focus on day to day work.

The haze in the name is also descriptive of it's qualities, will make your thoughts hazy.

Overall, a very good bud without too much of a sensational impact. Very smooth and calm experience allowing user to focus. Would recommend to anyone looking to relieve anxiety sympt...”"
MileHighBeauty420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mako-haze/reviews/1322903,"“This strain is an A++ in my book, not to mention literally helps me get A+ 😄 It's a really nice head high and has a decent little body high that accompanies it as well but it does seem like it's more in the head for sure. Medically: It helped with my chronic pain, as well as depression. I would definitely recommend. Great for getting school work done, being creative, or even just chillin.”"
