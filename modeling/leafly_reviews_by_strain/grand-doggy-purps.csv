I suffer from chronic pain from a severe crushed ankle joint and broken leg. helps with the inflammation too. however, it was just a tad to strong for me. I'm a fairly new smoker so maybe I can grow into it.  I did have a few second hallucination where I was sitting in my car (not driving) and felt like it was moving hahaha. I do feel it's not the best for my anxiety disorder as i...”"
XanderFrost,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grand-doggy-purps/reviews/1380623,"“My dispensary just got this strain in and I had to try it out. Definitely worth it, instantly relaxing you yet uplifting at the same time. Floralish but sweet taste. The sample I tried was 27% THC and 1.05% CBD. So it definitely can be a heavy hitter.”"

themax543211,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grand-doggy-purps/reviews/1417432,"“Had this strain fresh dried, no cure. It has an amazing taste and is well refined. It tastes sweet like honey and rolls off the tongue easy. You don't realize that you've smoked a ton until it hits you. The high is very uplifting and cerebral. I felt more motivated to finish tasks and I felt more creative. The downside is that there was slight anxiety to work through and a little bit of jitteriness.”"

For joint and body pain, anxiety, gastrointestinal inflammation and insomnia, this is a Steady-Eddie keep it in the rotation strain for me.  I prefer this strain in flower, however vape carts are just as effective.  For me, the head high usually starts at hit 3, and usually beats out the pain relief at the beginning of the sessions. But within ...”"

EndoCannaBliss,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grand-doggy-purps/reviews/1491261,"“This was fucking awful, and I’m hoping it’s just because of the grow facility. Tried this with my friend who got it from her local dispensary in Rockford, IL. We have used a volcano for over a decade, and tried one bag of this. We got violently sick immediately after only a few draws and ended up vomiting violently for hours and had the worst headaches of our entire lives. I tasted the most incredibly awful chemical ...”"
