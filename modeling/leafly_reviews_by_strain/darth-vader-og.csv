Ive heard this is a true purp, but every nug was bright green, with a white glaze from the furry white trichs covering it. There was a off color tint to it, not purple, but almost seemed like it could have been. The smell was like minty grapes.

FranklinsDew,https://www.leafly.com/indica/darth-vader-og/reviews/1397703,"“Second time trying this strain from dispensary. Quite nice not a knock out Indica but a very relaxing, calming and work great for high anxiety and panic attacks. Might very well work for other condition pain and maybe inflammation. Very nice Taste and is the most awesomeness purple shade you will find. A must try.”"
TrueHardLuck,https://www.leafly.com/indica/darth-vader-og/reviews/1360650,"“For whatever reason, it is the wake and bake for me. Maybe it's my PTSD'd and sometimes manic mind, but it calms me all throughout, eases both mental and physical pain, and is one of the few indicas that really work well for me. I am adding this to my strain profile.”"

I love heavy indicas but this one did not live up to the hype. It would probably be heavy if you're a moderate to novice user but if you're a high tolerance user this won't knock you out. Romulan is still my go to knock out.”"

Upon opening the bag it smells like Grapes and ONLY Grapes, it smells incredible. The taste was also grapey with a bit of gas. The High is really relaxing while uplifting at the same time!”"

Some paranoia and increased appetite but bursts of creativity and lots of pain relief really balanced out the negative effects.”"

MJA9213,https://www.leafly.com/indica/darth-vader-og/reviews/1156779,"“Pros: relaxing body and head high, perfect for unwinding after a stressful day, gives you a stronger appetite if necessary. It is definitely a night-time strain!

Cons:  makes your eyelids feel heavy, difficulty focusing, unproductive and lazy, easy tasks such as walking becomes undesirable”"

The third time I smoked it I said "weed I am your mother" in my best Darth Vader voice and finally got high. Very boring. Made me fall asleep fast. Bedtime weed!”"
