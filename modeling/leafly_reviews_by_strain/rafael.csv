The smell is great, it's looks very good,crunchy.
Give you the same feeling as a strain with high level of THC, but without, messing with your mind. 
Excels in muscles relief! very good for concentration,
appetite, breathing problems... (after consuming 0.10G in a vaporizer).

The overall effect are very positive, great for day uses.”"
