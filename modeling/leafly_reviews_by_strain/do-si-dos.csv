I suggest don’t watch any scary movie while getting high off dosidos weed because I was paranoid as hell lol. Beside that, I enjoy this weed so much, no headaches, mouth wasn’t dry at all, smoked so smoothing and wonderful taste absolutely! I love this amazing Highness! Main reason because I was so fucking happy! Lol”"

I had recently had issue with another company’s carts & needed to replace it. With my severe anxiety & PTSD, I have to be so careful about what strains I use so I don’t aggravate it. Came on here & read lots of reviews, I know there are 3 (maybe more) different Do Si Dos, #9, #22 & #40something, mine was #22. GREAT indica, total...”"

I only took a few hits and felt very overwhelmed by the high. It was almost scary. As the high began to wear off and I began to relax, I started to feel these intense feelings of anxiety. This strain literally had me so paranoid that I started having these irrational thoughts that every choice I had made in life was wrong and that I was messing ...”"

It reminds me a bit of gorilla glue in its earthy, terp-heavy smell and soft, girthy nug structure. The high is very all-encompassing for me. I feel very creative and stimulated but also relaxed enough to sit back and enjoy the present moment. Looking forward to a little more experience with this strain!

A bit anxious when it first kicked in but that lasted only about 10 minutes. This high made me feel very slow but not in a bad way. Just longer to do things etc so definitely a strictly nighttime strain. Cons are the kick in anxiousness and a little dizzyness. First time timers stay away lol. A+ for pain and insomnia thou...”"

As a cannabis user, the effects that I look for in a strain are: euphoria, relaxation, uplifted, happy, giggly, tingly, and something I like to call “The Kwan”. The Kwan is that feeling you get with certain strains that just make you say, “Yeah, this is some GOOD shit”. It is the word I use to describe that feeling you get when you want to get up and dance....”"
