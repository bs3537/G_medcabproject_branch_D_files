So come along! Now, lettuce talk about the buds. They allllmost have purple. It was somewhat confusing, because the sample buds i was shown i swore had a...”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starfighter/reviews/1418656,"“Very, very nice. I have one of those amazing unicorn jobs... my boss brought me to Farma to pick out an eighth of my choice for a job well done... I grabbed the Starfighter from Green Bodhi. It was between the Starfighter and the Ghost OG, because when you see Green Bodhi on the menu, you buy it. 

Starfighter is great. This batch tested at 24% THC and is a mild high, which I appreciate. We've smoked three bowls over...”"

devildogmafia,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starfighter/reviews/1377962,"“Picked up some Greenlight in Issaquah recommended and it is fire. The bud smells like no other with an aroma that reminds me of Pine Sol. I never have smelled a bud so lemony and piney. I highly recommend this dank ass herb.”"

Laedus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starfighter/reviews/1568543,"“This is the best medicine I've ever had. Very good for mental illness. Anxiety killer. Depression killer. Appetite Stimulate.  All without putting you to sleep. Dry mouth is minimal which is a huge plus.  You'll get dry eyes though. It has a nice after glow after the main effects wear off leaving you feeling great.  If you need medicine, look no further.  (purchased from The Farm in Boulder)”"

It's delicious and really makes music sound and feel so much better.  I'm totally in love.  I've been high af but still productive, just made a complicated meal and cleaned up my mess and then sat down to write this review.  I felt a little giddy earlier.  So good.  Very satisfied with my purchase. <3”"

bigquayle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starfighter/reviews/1690188,"“Starfighter is not really built for battle... More like cruisin' around the Galaxy with the top down and wearing sunglasses. Watching the universe go by as you lounge in the gentle euphoria of the milky way leather seats.. I love groovin to this tune.”"
PlayPretty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starfighter/reviews/1749790,"“This stuff is amazing. For my dom it is like viagra and kept him going all night long and the next morning.  I must say it gave the lady bits a bit of a buzz, too.  Of all the strains we use, and this one is new to us, got it at THCU in Trinidad, never had one that was so excellent for sex and BDSM play.”"

avehcado,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starfighter/reviews/1349742,"“I smoked barely a bowl last night in my car, and you best believe my ass was tripping. I didn't think I was that high at first because it takes a moment to really hit you. I walked out of the car into the lobby of my hotel and I was dead sure I looked high af. As soon as I laid onto the bed, my mind started to open or something, It's definitely an intense body/head high, I could feel every beat of my music, and I sta...”"

RyannRyder,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starfighter/reviews/1735156,"“This stain has ended up being one of my favorites. It has a really nice fruity flavor and smokes really nice. I will say that if you don't usually smoke a lot, then to start off will a small amount because this stain was really strong and was really helped me fall asleep. Overall, great smoke. Highly recommended.”"

legalizeTX,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starfighter/reviews/1373094,"“This strain is very good, smoking it right now actually. Uplifted, clear headed and hungry. Around the 3rd bowl its indica traits become apparent and super chillness falls upon you. Not a top 5 strain but very respectable 4 star.”"

blazeethan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starfighter/reviews/1373197,"“very euphoric strain. made my entire body feel warm and fuzzy. a little indica dominate but really good balance between the two. minty flavor with a little wood. very bad munchies.”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starfighter/reviews/1615646,"“A great smoke for 420. This one hits hard in both mind and body. That's what I liked about this one. You can easily move about or just as easily couch locked. It let's you decide what type of experience you will have. Very friendly and talkative but also conscience expanding and relaxing all at the same time. I'm quite satisfied with SF.”"

MikeyMike86,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starfighter/reviews/1324881,"“Very nice strain. It is a pleasant smoking flower. Nice pungent smell. For me the high just didn't last as long but was great at its peak. If you're a cougher this strain might be heavy on your throat.”"
