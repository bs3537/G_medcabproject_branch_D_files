I felt happy and relaxed but not so much that I was too couch locked. This made me super MUNCHY. So if you need an appetite stimulant this would be perfect. Had heightened arousal, not as much as some strains, but definitely notable. Went to bed easily and didn't wake up once during the night. Overall nice strain.”"

As far as quality and consistency this is my top 5 bud of all time!”"

It had one of my boys trippin, saying random numbers, and he was Stuck on a bench. he was supposed to be home already. Then he started packing back and forth. Another one of my boys was High for 2 hours of of two little hits. That's what he told me. Good but Bad.”"
