Nomad7-3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1339909,"“This is my daily go-to Herb - relieves pain, lifts up the spirit, allows for clarity and focus, and provides energy and motivation to take care of the daily stuff around the house.  Causes ZERO stress/anxiety/paranoia, an issue which I have had in the past with other strains.  My only complaint is that my sources supply is not consistent, I sometimes have to wait weeks before I can get access.
I'd love to get some be...”"
Mysticwolf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1410336,"“Nice pungent aroma, fuelie funk, woodsy citrus, and man, it's loud!! Nice and smooth smoked in my simple bubbler, earthy taste, great mouth feel, smooth on the inhale and exhale. Hits pretty quick, cerebral for an Indica dominant strain, I'm feeling pretty creative, but really relaxed too. The nugs were tight, compact, really dense and covers in crystal.”"
hunter9231,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1420008,"“• I was extremely excited to try this newbie after reading such extreme reviews! Quite true that aroma, flavor, taste are strangely generic-earthy/woodsy, albeit the faint undertones are definitely afgooey and mild. It's an easy-to-smoke, strangely gentle body buzz & euphoric high — also easy to see why it's in so many folks' Top 3 Faves + medi-cine cab-mainstay, most especially for long'timers. Highly recommend; 4.5...”"

Burnability 10 
Do not disrespect this flower 
She takes care to be undressed and should be blazed a bong
Cloud Density 11 
An extra point for its extra viscose cloud which disperses slower than radioactive gas leak 
Rate of Change 11 
An extra point for the immediate change 
You won't even know you're high”"
c.clos420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1609470,"“Woody taste and good mouth feeling. Good body buzz with a euphoric high. My morning smoke for the weekend during morning errands as it allows clarity and creativity without being super high. No paranoid feeling. A happy state of mind.”"
HippieVision,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1248344,"“I love this strain it's a kick I'm pretty new to everything and this kicks my ass lovely strain”"
chaaanny,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1799510,"“Snow Lotus is probably my new favorite strain for medicinal purposes, especially anxiety. I’ve suffered from severe anxiety & depression rooting from both genetics as well as PTSD for the entirety of my adult life. This has been so helpful in gently but swiftly calming my anxiety & lifting me out of depression without sedating me. I feel like myself finally, without constantly finding something to worry about or both...”"
AltonF,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1484934,"“My favorite go-to hybrid besides GG#4... .  Great mellow chemical taste which blows my mind leading to a fantastic high that I truly adore my baked friends. Even recommend this to my enemies ;)”"
tiamoemia,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1204439,"“This strain is amazing! it gets you to a nice buzz, but not a heavy stone.”"
kooch51,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1649633,"“This stuff hits like a train for me, if getting  hit by a train was a good thing! I’ve been out of it for awhile and just got more tonight I forgot how quick it hit.  Granted I’m a evening/night smoker I don’t get the energy from it, I find it super relaxing.  I have anxiety issues and a couple times it’s made me a little anxious, but not paranoid.  Has a district flavor almost like a bit of seaweed, not a bad thing ...”"
webbystonr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1245422,"“Probably top 5 strains of mine. Potency is high but the effect of this strain is unique and distinguishable. Smells potent as it is. The Herbal connect always has fire on this level”"

sampad909,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1314603,"“1 of the dopest dopes I've ever smoked. Great long lasting euphoric effects with a light tingly body high. Nice for any day or night, one of my favorites.”"

Painterguy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1787056,"“GREAT coverage of sticky trichomes. Terrific bag appeal and a very relaxing, pain relieving, buzz.”"
MyJokerHandStayLIT,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1505859,"“Using a moderately small dab for me which is much larger for others but I was able to get a very very nice rush of good feelings happy feelings, my body feels more energetic I feel happier thinking a little bit more silly and it’s definitely relaxing this is a great overall strain”"
ultrapop,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-lotus/reviews/1339908,"“Seems like this one grew out really nice, chunky dense broccoli style bud but lacks the kick I was looking for. Has very little flavor profile and had no scent notes when it was ground up.

As for the head it's not soo bad, kinda hit me in the front but lacks the euphoric rush I look for in sativa based strains  I would pass on this, further evidence we're climbing higher in the THC content of strains. Hang on kids.....”"
