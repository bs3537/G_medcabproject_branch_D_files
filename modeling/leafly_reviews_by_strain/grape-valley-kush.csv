The cultivators knew exactly what they were doing with this one. Dark green and purple buds that were covered in trichomes, literally looks as though they rolled it in sugar! Fruity aroma in the front at first and then you get the kushy smell. The buds were super dense and the smallest nug broke up to a large amoun...”"

CDE93,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-valley-kush/reviews/1577812,"“Just picked up a batch testing at 32.7% THC from Medizin in Las Vegas (flower made by Shango) and lemme say this is some powerful shit. STRONG INDICA!!!. Purple accents throughout all the buds and dusted with hefty amounts of trichomes, which is exactly what I wanted. This is perfect for us with high tolerance, as I suppose a beginner could get paranoid with this much THC content. Overall 5/5 will definitely pick up ...”"

It's my absolute favorite strain! Pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, nausea do not exist in Grape Valley. The way this strain makes your body, mind, and soul feel are mind blowing!

ChemicalGeorge,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-valley-kush/reviews/1627336,"“Picked this one up at Blum on Desert Inn. This strain has a very subtle, soft grape smell to it. It is sedative and gives you a nice body high. I smoked it on my bubbler, a whole bowl to myself mind you. Once I went to bed, that was it for me! Try this strain if it's available at any dispensary in your city!”"

I was suffering from major levels of pain on a multi-system level. After a decent sized bowl of Grape Valley, I didn’t feel a THING for the rest of the night and, I went right to sleep a few hours later. My batch tested at 24.97%. This is my new favorite strain!!”"

Mols17,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-valley-kush/reviews/1498290,"“The feeling hits just a few minutes after smoking. Totally relaxed and all stress has dissolved. Great for anxiety and difficulty relaxing. First time ever smoking this strain and I already know that this will be added to the rotation lol Has a great flavor, you can totally get the berry and fruitiness, even as a fairly new smoker with what I would call “a pallet in training”.”"

Looks super sugary due to the high Cannabinoids. Taking a smaller dab of course due to this as well. And 💨—  I feel my anxiety leave instantly. My breathing and the chest tightness gets much better. I feel my mind thinking more fluidly in a wavy way. Very euphoric. I feel very uplifted...”"
