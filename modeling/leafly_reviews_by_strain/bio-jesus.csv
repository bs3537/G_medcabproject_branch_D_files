BirdBrain,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bio-jesus/reviews/1409857,"“Bio Jesus is one of the frostiest and most potent strains of cannabis I have ever encountered. I purchased this indica-dominant hybrid sample from Denver Relief, being very impressed with the bag/jar appeal.

I'm a longtime sativa guy but lately - thanks to having access to a dispensary - I've been trying more indicas, specifically for pain issues.  Bio-Jesus is my favorite indica so far.  It has IMMEDIATE pain relieving properties, induces relaxation, and makes me feel content.  I can breathe really deeply after vaping this.  It doesn't last very long, I will say - but it's fairly heavy at first.    I woul...”"
