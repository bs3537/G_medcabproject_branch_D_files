DaFawk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/huckleberry/reviews/1415625,"“I saw Huckleberry in the clinic a couple days ago and after smelling and looking at it decided it would be the next strain that i would try. The smell was very unique berry scent that explodes out into your nose when you put your nose to the jar, the smell for some reason went very well with the name 'huckleberry'. Then I got home and rolled a joint and packed a few bowls. I expected, especially since the nugs were v...”"

Huckleberry hits much like Blueberry, straight to the head, but there is more cerebral effect, and its much, much tastier. both incredible bud...”"

partyslayer1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/huckleberry/reviews/1412377,"“first impressions are very positive, uplifting but still enough of a euphoric tickle to you giggle.

Great for daytime veteran smokers.”"
palmbaygay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/huckleberry/reviews/1361114,"“Great strain, the high makes it feel like your floating on air. The aroma is very sweet and berry just like the name suggest.

moonstar11187,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/huckleberry/reviews/1442718,"“I generally like this strain , Illinois strain tested at 21% THC . it's a tad above average like 3.5/5 . It has a strange taste like no other cannabis I've tried , not a bad taste per se but def it's own flavor. It's a hybrid that is just about 50:50 , don't expect to be couch locked or up and giggle . U will be neither . U most likely will be somewhere in the middle , mellow and calm”"

Absolutely, NO anxiety or "Sativa-Hyper" affect at all.  In fact,  it is quite helpful to my anxiety, and more closely resembles an "Indica" effect.

is the best body high I’ve come across, it feels like after-sex. Which is fucking awesome. And blueberry pie flavor is 10/10 as well.  Well rounded perfect hybrid strain”"
