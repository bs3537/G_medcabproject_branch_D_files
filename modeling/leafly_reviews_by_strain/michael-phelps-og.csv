Canna_Maid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/michael-phelps-og/reviews/1360022,"“The most gassy OG I have ever come across, such a perfumey undertone of the black water cross. Best strain of 2015”"
spainpower17,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/michael-phelps-og/reviews/1360023,"“I didn't really like the aroma it put off. But the sensation it had: euphoria, relaxation, and a good sleep made me love it. It's dank for sure. I'll be glad to pick this up again!”"
TheFoxSays,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/michael-phelps-og/reviews/1373022,"“5/5 - Michael Phelps OG 
The description here is pretty close - take a small dose and you can still function.. Take a few more hits to the dome and Indica effects start to take over.

Then I take a few more huge rips and each pull feels like diving into a pool of pine scented bubbles. Tastes like smoking pine needles - out of a pine cone, then pine tar and pine sap dripping on the exhale. Sleep follows soon after. Ma...”"

goCannaOne,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/michael-phelps-og/reviews/1235546,"“A- :

Everything about this strain I wanted to like, but ultimately the aroma had a bit too much Sour Diesel in there taking away the sharp pine fuel stink and replacing it with a more planty sweet. 

High was great, but lacked the lung expansion that comes with other, super resiny designer OGs.”"
PoliticallyActavis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/michael-phelps-og/reviews/1373020,"“It was cracking. The aromatic aroma mixed with that chronic citrus that went straight to the chrome. Niggas fiending for the money, but don't want to pay a loan. South side boi look who dis guy domed over an iphone. Bararatataa ThAt good shit hmu if you Tryna smoke”"

AllState951,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/michael-phelps-og/reviews/1645167,"“The strain I purchased didn’t taste well at all, but that was probably from poor cultivation. The effects are relaxing, nice and happy high with some creativity. Helps headache! I smoke sativa all day and end up with a headache. After a couple puffs of this my headache fades. Dark taste, great high.”"

MRWEST86,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/michael-phelps-og/reviews/1356882,"“Not a bad strain, semi sweet smell but not a kick in the face type of aroma. The effects don't show their full effects immediately, so caution when having a heavy session.  The taste matches the smell, not very strong but present nontheless”"
voltairedeux,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/michael-phelps-og/reviews/1383816,"“This is one of the best strains I've ever tried.  When my buddy first held it in his hand and I gave it a whiff, I, and all others present, noted that it smelled like we imagined the man himself to smell.  When first purchasing this strain, I had a conversation with the lass selling it to me at the Unified Collective, and we both remarked that it doesn't matter how much trouble he'd gotten in when news first broke, M...”"
