It's not overwhelming, but I'd stay well clear of bicycles, skateboards and especially automobiles when consuming this deeply relaxing Indica...  I like to use Grape Drink in a tincture- for use in medicated mint juleps.. made with the finest bourbon whiskey of course!”"

It is the darkest purple I have seen and the biggest outdoor purple nugs I have seen in awhile. Definitely the hardest hitting indica I have had. Great strain!”"

Nice body sensation, had mad munches, and always crashed into sleep after. Smoking in bowl/blunt gave unpleasant fire taste Thoughts were slightly paranoid. Not my favorite strain and will not be buying again, but good enough to smoke the rest of the 1/8th I bought.”"
