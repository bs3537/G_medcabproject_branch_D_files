MYLuna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-sour-widow/reviews/1336492,"“Being a Bartender with PTSD and chronic hip/leg pain due to medical hardware, this is an amazing strain.  It has a sweetly sour initial hit while finishing with a flavor of apricot. This is achieved via vaping however.  The come up is slightly euphoric and quite thought invoking.  I am able to then enjoy the proceeding flux of happiness that ensues while being exceedingly social and coherent.  Best strain for my impe...”"

Look: Gooey and almost soupy look, when handled though it is completly stable. Never seen anything like it before. Dark amber color.
Smell: A sour mix of chemmy haze n diesel with a hint of citrus and skunkyness. Taste was lead by a light sour lemon flavor with a chemmy-hazey-diesel overtone. 
Effects: This really had me feeling good. every dab or rip off the pen would uplift me and produce a...”"
Puns,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-sour-widow/reviews/1298703,"“At first I was sceptical of the potency of the Super Sour Widow due to the bud not looking as aesthetic as some of the other strains. After a couple of days however, this is definitely on the potent side, urging users to be active and relaxed.

The flavour is pretty average but it goes down smoothly. I would recommend this to a friend.”"

This strain is excellent for beginners as it does not have the harsher side effects of many strains.  It works well for pain, anxiety, and depression, and is also a "social strain" and can generally be used by those with social anxiety .  It also produces ...”"

Puns,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-sour-widow/reviews/1226900,"“The strain is undoubtedly potent, only needing one bowl to get decently high.

The downsides with this strain is its psychoactivity which makes it very harsh on smokers with anxiety etc.”"

Nice smooth smoke with minimal coughing. Effects felt promptly 5-10 mins after consuming noticing feeling behind eyes. Nice come down also great day time smoke.

I picked up a gram of Super Widow (super sour widow) BHO for $20. It is 80.45% and a Sativa hybrid.  Omg. This strain is amazing. One dab, and I’m golden. Very cerebral at first and then goes into a tingle down your shoulders. I don’t feel stuck to the couch and in fact am going to go do the dishes! 
Oh it’s by Royal Oil Bad As...”"
