Tight dense nuggets covered in a myriad of hazy white crystals.  Beautiful orange hairs sprout from everywhere.  The aroma initially hits you with a gentle sweetness and then your nose is flooded with an electrifying sour lemony overtone, sending a wave of chills up and down your spine.  The smell alone acts as an aphrodisiac.  Upon v...”"

Instantly I found a comfort, that for years I sought out in pills and whiskey and sadly never found. My anxiety, stress, depression and alcoholism disappear within moments of inhalation.

I was weary about Sativas for a long time because of unwanted anxiety. SSD was my first Sativa experience that didn't go awry.

The feeling is very creative, euphoric, and mildly psychedelic. The strong head high is followed by a mild, relaxing body stone. All pain is melted away.

If you love a really potent sativa, I strongly recommend this strain.”"
swerv512,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/super-sour-diesel/reviews/1375947,"“A true sativa. After many trials with heavy indicas, I decided on a sativa that also offers pain relief and cerebral high. A great strain for outdoor activity, lots of energy to go on day hikes and feel energized. Also, enough cerebral high to spend a lot of time laughing at nothing in particular and forgetting what you were just doing. Stoney powerful stuff.”"

Everything you'd expect so I won't go on long,
crystal covered leaves that looked like they were rolled in kief, orange hairs peeking out, sticky green buds are loosely dense, and smoke is smooth and distinct!
Sativa high creeps within minutes with a taste that still lingers, 
delicious smell and all in all great, GREAT medicine!
