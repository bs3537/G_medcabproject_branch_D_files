I put this up there with Blue Dream and Honey Bananas. I feel so euphoric and so got damn happy. I was listening to some psychedelic rock and every beat felt like it touched my skin. And, did I mention how sexy it made me feel? Damn... I felt like Halle Barry in “Swordfish”. Deadass. I also feel creative —like I want to paint something...”"

JoeJackson206,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato-33/reviews/1697887,"“Lust at first sight . One of the most Physically beautiful strains you could ever hope to lay eyes on.  From it’s dark to light purple tint accented by strips of Lime and dark green , Gelato #33 looks like weed you’d dream of smoking . The taste is Classic GSC taste with a sweeter note that leaves your taste buds on 10. The High is relaxing yet not sedative.”"

I am able to get things done on the creative side. Writing or any other creative activity will be greatly enhanced with this strain. I do not recommend smoking this before work you can get a little too creative and that can carry over into serious situations. Be careful and make sure you get the real strain as advertised this is the...”"

The high is quite strong but it doesn’t vera one way or the other it is a true hybrid that will relax you but not to the point of exhaustion or over excitement during the day. For me it is a great strain for what it is used for but it’s not necessary for my medicinal pu...”"

A super tasty strain, this gelato is easy to smoke and hits incredibly fast. I look for strains that are happy and keep my anxiety at bay- this definitely fits the bill.

At first I felt very calm and relaxed. We smoked in a Walmart parking lot in my car. We, after smoking, went into the Walmart and that's when this strain fully kicked in. I felt like I had got punched in the face. I nearly green out in the Walmart. My friends finished up there shopping and after I had walked out ...”"
