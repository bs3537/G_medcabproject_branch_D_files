highpineapple,https://www.leafly.com/indica/5th-element/reviews/1362380,"“Earthy sweet taste, with a smooth draw, this strain had me feeling amazing! 
Melted my muscle tensions and anxiety while not producing any negative mental effects. A heavy hitting relaxer for this one so best use would be in the evening. 

Overall, very lovely strain.”"
nycchicknphx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/5th-element/reviews/1479928,"“Oh!  This sticky, dense understated looking nugget that is so potent I'm impressed. Feels very tingly, cerebral, and therapeutic - seriously, it's almost like a nice body massage. Im feeling this one. This is a heavy high so be prepared...yep. It's that good. 😉”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/5th-element/reviews/1509041,"“LEELU MULTIPASS

Anyways I was stoaked to see this strain hit my local dispensaries shelf. I'm the kind of person who tries as many strains as possible and rarely gets the same one twice. 
I am absolutely loving this indica buzz, for awhile I have been enjoying Sativa's. All indica buzz's felt alike to me for sehile”"

Wuuzoku,https://www.leafly.com/indica/5th-element/reviews/1362382,"“This strain in concentrate form tastes very earthy and has a hash like resin taste at the end. Concentrate was shatter and it was taken with a large snake like dab. It delivers a hell of an Indica effect to it, it's alright.”"
Blaztoise160,https://www.leafly.com/indica/5th-element/reviews/1533661,"“Cerebral, and relaxing good for evening use. I had two bowls after work, and felt relaxed and euphoric. I was able to talk on the phone with a friend, usually I'm nervous and tripping over my words. I have noticed a renewed effect from cannabis on my anxiety, since I cut back and switched to only evening sessions, this strain is great for that.”"
SunshineGurl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/5th-element/reviews/1648255,"“If you are looking for a good indica, search no further. In small amounts it’s incredible, anything more than that & it is lights out for me. Great strain. Excellent for insomnia”"
MrMary,https://www.leafly.com/indica/5th-element/reviews/1305857,"“Found a frosty fruity berry pheno with no herms after 3 rounds. Great OG funk under the sweetness and all OG on exhale. Great mid-end of day smoke to get the stress moving out.”"
Blaztoise160,https://www.leafly.com/indica/5th-element/reviews/1533662,"“Very cerebral, and relaxing great for night time smoke seshes. I felt fairly immediate body relaxation, and euphoria. I have noticed a renewed effect from cannabis with my anxiety, since I switched to night time sessions only. If you smoke for anxiety, and you feel like you aren't getting what you need, or worse the constant high THC levels increases your anxiety, then I'd say cutting back could be helpful.”"

Smokes very smooth with a creeping up kind of high that pulls you in slowly. I rolled a joint of this and before I was finished I started to feel my back muscles relax even before I felt the high. real dope”"

But it had a thicker smoke. I liked  it to smoke but not enough to do it again. It euphoria, makes you lazy, helped pain, and my depression. More Indica traits with blackberry kush flavors.”"

Works amazing for the horrible insomnia I have, which was the exact reason I decided to try it. Just wish I could come across this strain more often!”"
MedicalMParadise,https://www.leafly.com/indica/5th-element/reviews/1502191,"“It's an indica that takes a few moments to kick in. It's a very calming strain. It's not a sleepy calm, just the body and mood are calmed. It's just an all-around generic indica strain. It doesn't have any wowing factors, but it's a good and affordable daily strain. I would say it does also make it harder for me to focus, but great to relax with music or a movie.”"

ejs190,https://www.leafly.com/indica/5th-element/reviews/1505985,"“5th Elements frequency is definitely one that will take you to other planetary dimensions. It subtle flavor is reminiscent of roasted pine nuts. Quickly it detaches your mind from the spinal column and by that point you should be ready for a journey of intergalactic proportions. Bong recommended for deep interstellar journeying.”"
