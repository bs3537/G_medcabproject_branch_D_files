GanjaFasha,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-alien/reviews/1417691,"“I found the high to be a quick onset decently long lasting high, lasting about a hour and a half to two hours on a small bowl.

Light flowery smell with almost no smell from the Sour Diesel genetics. The taste was actually quite refreshing (Smoked from Bong). The high is very much consistent with hybrids. It starts with a quick shot to euphoria then tapers down your spine and slowly spreads throughout your extremiti...”"
JellySamich,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-alien/reviews/1387600,"“Beam me up! This is the same Sour D favorite with a Smooooth body high. Happy, uplifting, focused, mind-opening head high but not too much. The Alien relaxes the body and mind which allows for great, anxiety-free flow whether you're on the go or if you want to read/meditate without falling asleep. No issues with dry mouth or munchies. Great for stress relief.”"
