MrMary,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jawa-pie/reviews/1374321,"“Another killer strain from Ocean Grown seeds. Beautiful dense buds with frost for days. Broken open it smells like lime candy combined  with an incredibly delicious earthy funk. Exhaled it will explode into a mouth watering lime kruller donut flavor that will literally,make you salavate. Buzz is very relaxing and superb for end of the day or watching the OG crew on the Tube.”"

djmindyj,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jawa-pie/reviews/1562254,"“Best Indica strain for pain that I have ever smoked!! Wow!! Half of a joint of this heavenly strain gave me 24 hours of pain relief. Perfect for medical patients seeking muscle relaxation and sedation.”"
25yearvet,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jawa-pie/reviews/1739705,"“Great night bud.  Good potency, burn and flavor.  Just a solid Indica!”"
Lcrummel,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jawa-pie/reviews/1626289,"“Take a whiff of the madness. One of my favorite strain discoveries of the year straight out of Massachusetts. It has a super sugary smell that greets the nose with pleasantness. The buds are a frosty green and gooey on the inside. I can taste a hint of OG flavor, but the taste is more enduring and weed-y for lack of a better term. High is super relaxed and mellow but clearheaded with limited anxiety. Love it.”"

squintymcgee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jawa-pie/reviews/1430410,"“This strain has a funky smell. The nugs are dense but squishy. Has a good taste and the feeling is relaxed. Not the heaviest indica but it's nice for anxiety.”"
