Looks frosty, feathery, full bright neon green frosty nugs with neon red hairs. Taste comes out like aroma with skunk translated to hints of wood and chemical (like strawberry cough crossed with gods gift). The effects are that imitating a glass of wine. Very relaxed in body all over and a serious slight happiness that was i...”"

A little on the weak side for me but I still love it just for the taste and the effect. I will use it more for a day smoke. I tried it because it said the effects were like Grandaddy Purple strain (I have been wanting to try that & still haven't yet).The effects were very mellow and relaxed without feeling like you wanted to sleep. Took away all the pain and headache. De...”"

babbalooeybooey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/brandywine/reviews/1560383,"“I’m reluctant to medicate with indicas because of the munchie factor...my satiation neurons effectively shut down and it’s a Bluto-esque feast that doesn’t end.  

Brandywine has given me the joy of indica while keeping the munchies away.   Very nice cerebral, tingly high accompanied by a warm body buzz.   My knee pain goes away in minutes after a rip from the Top Puff.”"

It's smooth a tiny bit of the earthy taste. You take 2 more hits and you notice that any anxiety you had is slowing down, your pacing stops you start feeling like your ready to settle down. You feel creative, motivated like everything's clear. Any pain you had (mod to mild) you don't realize it's there. You begin something and forget w...”"

This strain, Brandywine, is literally THE BEST, MOST AMAZING strain I have EVER tried!!!! I only purchased a tiny bit of it from my local dispensary unfortunately. I have not come across it since. But DANG, even though I only smoked a bit at a time, this super potent stuff knocked me on my ass EVERY...”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/brandywine/reviews/1632884,"“A friend recommended this strain, so I tried it before reading reviews... And hoo-eee it was a body tingling, face melting, diesel-tasting, warm blanket of indica love. When I later learned it has recently won the Seattle DOPE Cup, I wasn't at all surprised. I hope we start seeing a lot more Brandywine on shelves, this is pure fire, great for pain, stress... perfect for Netflix and bed.”"
DJ-Eklektik,https://www.leafly.com/indica/brandywine/reviews/1784143,"“another awesome strain i picked up at phytologie wellness in oakland. this one is a couch locker for sure super stony indica that had me looking at my decks rather than using them to spin. plumy grapey sweet taste with a smooth tasty smoke. could taste it more thru the king raw than i could the wood.”"
QueenDelJackson,https://www.leafly.com/indica/brandywine/reviews/1762907,"“When I moved to California I decided to try weed again, soon realizing I was still very sensitive to weed, in particular Sativa. After trying 15 to 20 or so strains, this one has risen to the only one that I want to seek again. As I mentioned, i'm very sensitive to the mental alteration of Sativa, so I require a strict classical Indica. 

Visual impression: Very pretty and bright, slight gold appearance, dark purple ...”"

HippieBuddha,https://www.leafly.com/indica/brandywine/reviews/1469822,"“Nada. Zip. Zzzzzzzz.
I understand that different strains effect people in different ways,  but c'mon.
No body melt, no mood alteration. Just immediate onset profound sleepiness. But I soldiered on...smoked at least half a gram. Still nothing. Sorry to be the dissenter among the ranks :(”"
