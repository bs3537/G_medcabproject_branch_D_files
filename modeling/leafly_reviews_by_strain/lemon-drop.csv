Maia0x0x,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-drop/reviews/1557422,"“No sure what it is about this strain, but it never does it for me. Short lived high that never seems quite strong enough. Mostly energizing. Decent if i just need some short lived stress relief or need to nazi micro manage my doses for some reason. Taste is lemony  and herby but nothing earth shattering about it.”"

Hamilton4595,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-drop/reviews/1768448,"“Had the pleasure of picking this up on a trip to Cali last year. Bought from a dispensary in San Diego. My girlfriend and I were only in town for a few days so we only got a few grams. Should have bought a lot more.

The stuff knocks you on your ass. Had me so relaxed that I couldn’t feel my legs. By the time we got back to the hotel, we were stoned out of our heads. Most weed makes me horny anyway and this strain wa...”"

icefisherman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-drop/reviews/1722752,"“Outstanding cut from a renowned WA grower. Aroma like Lemonheads candy, not so much on the taste though.  2 hits and I'm done-hours of intense focus and shit-eating grin.  Has an interesting tingling effect on the extremities which makes you relax physically and relieves pain, also a headband effect.  Can delay falling asleep but once you do it's lights out.”"

The look of fluffy loose nugs doesn’t impress me, but color and trich make up for it. This cut looks slightly home grown which hinted me at its potency that most dispensary product lacks.

Anyway, what I had smelled good. Didn't sense much Lemon, but still nice. No hint of stinky cheese like other varieties, no berry smell. Something like citrus and menthol maybe.
