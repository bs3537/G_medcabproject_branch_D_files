CBD Critical
=============
Cannappist,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1416566,"“This strain should be famous. I picked some up at Farma in Portland. If you like CBD you have to try this. It's hard to find CBD weed that leans Indica, which this one does. Extremely (seriously) well rounded full body high that makes me think there must be something very special going on with the cannabinoid and terpene profile in this particular strain. Every time I smoke it it's perfect. I'm very picky about strai...”"
CaveBearDeluxe,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1427728,"“I tried this strain for the first time tonight and it's outstanding. This one's going to become a mainstay of my pain control. It vanquishes my chronic pain 100%, which doesn't usually happen for me. It has a smooth flavor and smells beautifully pungent. And it has me in such a lovely serene headspace. It was great listening to music with this strain. I noticed an hour after smoking that there was another strong wave...”"
Mike18040,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1428305,"“I ran into this strain after trying many others that weren't working so well for me.  All I can say is that after 3 small hits I have a smile on my face that the Rock himself wouldn't be able to slap offa me!!  I mean wow, chills down my spine, like I just did something seriously wrong and got away with it!  Makes my pain and anxiety melt away in seconds, even leaving yourself to wonder for hours on end, "was I ever ...”"
Fibro_Witch,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1466600,"“I really enjoy this strain. I was worried about the 1:1 ratio because I don't do well with THC, but this is fine. Relaxing, but not locking. Significant mood uplift too. Fine to try day or night. Does a good job treating my Rheumatoid Arthritis and quieting my anxiety. Daytime use helps me get chores done and gives me a positive outlook. Nighttime use helps me relax. Great for movies.”"
papaguru,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1418214,"“This takes care of the pain aggravated by tense muscles. Relaxing, a little trippy, but then it settles down and the pain goes away.
Used a vape stick for rosin.
The dispensary ran out and I am carefully managing what I have left because it works.
From what I've read about Critical Mass, it's parent, it's a heavy yielder, short season, compact plant.”"
dubyrunning,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1413143,"“This is a very relaxing, mellow strain.  I dry herb vape it before bed and develop a pleasant body high and meandering thoughts that lead me gently down into sleep.”"
madmoneymike,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1411701,"“dabbing some critical mass extract by Root Down a grower in Washington State. thca:45 cbd:18 and terps:8.5 

great taste, smooth smoke. my partner (suffers chronic pain) loves it as the night night dab, I'll use it before stressful or tense situations. I always buy this when I see it and always try to keep it stocked.”"
batgirl87,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1575639,"“Five isn’t enough stars ✨ I cannot say enough good about CBD Critical Mass. I have been searching for MY strain. This is it. 

This is the first and only strain that’s given me true relief from my chronic headaches. A few hits (doesn’t matter vape vs pipe vs joint vs bong) and I can start to feel sweet relief.  Sometimes I cry with relief. 

It’s the perfect balance of THC:CBD and it’s indica dominance is preferred b...”"
h3yhOwy0udOin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1449397,"“My CBD Critical Mass is coming in at 7.4% THC and 15.1% CBD...I've smoked half of blunt so far and I might be writing this review prematurely since I'm not yet getting a good read of the high. It doesn't feel as heavy of an Indica as I was expecting, but then again I need like a pure 100% indica. It did give me some more of an interest in what I was watching or playing. The smell is earthy I got almost a cream sent a...”"
danggirll,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1696210,"“As someone who deals with both anxiety and insomnia, as well as a low tolerance, this strain worked well for me. I take a CBD-only oil during the day and typically will smoke an indica in the evening before bed. It’s challenging to find an indica dominant CBD strain (I don’t fare well with sativas), but I’m so glad I found this one! Really mellow high, quite relaxing but I could also function if I wanted to smoke a b...”"
T0MMYDREAMER,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1490836,"“The perfect night cap. I've recently started working out and lifting weights again and this strain helps combat the soreness in my muscles and relaxes me to the fullest. Wash away the aches and pains you may have accrued throughout the day with this strain.”"
girlginger14,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1601800,"“I’m a beginner smoker and in my everyday life I do not have anxiety or panic attacks but every strain I’ve smoked so far in the indica family has given me anxiety and major panic attacks. After smoking CBD critical mass this is the first time I’ve ever been able to relax with no anxiety or panic attacks whatsoever! My heart never raced and my mind never worked itself into an episode. It gives an overall feeling of re...”"

sburke30,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1679168,"“Very gentle high. It isn’t necessarily going to rock your world. That being said, it is a very mellow high, melts away depression and anxiety quickly. Also was very effective for aches and pains.”"

jaredhuffman907,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1616277,"“Wow, just wow. I’ve never been the kind of stoner to go after a CBD heavy strain, but my girlfriend got a gram of this and I rolled a backwoods with that AND another gram of Holy Grail Kush.. Holy shit I was blown away. Flavor was fucking A1 and the high was great. My idea was to combine a CBD heavy strain with a THC heavy strain so I could feel the best of both worlds... it was amazing. If you get the chance to add ...”"

lotega,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1618665,"“Super nice, chill strain, delicious strain. The vape hit is a super smooth a tasty lemon cake flavor. It's got enough THC it is going to give you a nice high, but it's really mellow and relaxing. At first it makes me a bit talkative as it eases my social anxiety, but then as the high continues it starts to make me sleepy. Enough so that I don't think I could vape this during the day, but it helped me get to bed nice ...”"
platinumfairy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cbd-critical-mass/reviews/1803162,"“This strain has helped my chronic pain + fatigue more than any other strain out there. I was only able to find it in Rhode Island dispensaries when I lived there, and I hope one day I’ll find it again in Pennsylvania. Amazing for migraines, dissociation, insomnia, anxiety..never makes you feel too high, it’s just a DREAM”"
