Amazing stuff if you're having a hard time sleeping. Gotta try baking with it and hopefully that keeps me asleep throughout the night. If you have a hard time falling asleep this is the shit.”"

I love everything about it, blissfully coffee/caramel/Berry taste and I am a indica only person and this took over purple bubba and Kosher Kush as well as Afghani and Afghan Kush.

All these issues are struck down when consuming this fine herb.  This is my go to,  go to sleep stain.  It is also an exceptional pain reliever. You won't be disappointed.  My dispensary typically has this around 26-28% THC,  very strong and lovely.

I've only found a few other indicas that help but you never know what's gonna be on the menu. so when I heard of the Dakini Kush was at a dispensary close by I had to grab an ounce real quick before it sold out because it was very popular. I've heard people rave about this strain and so far it's money we...”"

kjchoya,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dakini-kush/reviews/1473529,"“I chose this strain to try for my insomnia. It does not work as well for me as other strains that I've tried. I felt effects, but not actual sleepiness. I decided to give it another try just for fun, and I fell in love with it. Nice, heavy mental effects that caused me to stand in my shower contemplating shampoo and conditioner for a good five minutes. I didn't experience couchlock, but I might have been moving a lit...”"
