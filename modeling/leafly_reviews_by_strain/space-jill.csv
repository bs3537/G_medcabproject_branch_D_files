My back was already hurting from doing some yardwork during the day (and I knew it works on pain), so I decided that the next time I started having a migraine, I would smoke some.

Well, today was the day to test it. One of My acquaintances refused to be civil in a conversation, which raised My stress level to the point of causing a migraine. I went out...”"

AngelWolf666,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/space-jill/reviews/1342216,"“Took a couple hits of this a couple hours before bed to kill a migraine that was starting up. Within a couple minutes, the migraine was gone, as was my back pain.

Unfortunately, I had a heavy weight start resting on My chest around the same time as My headache disappearing. About 10 minutes later, anxiety and paranoia set in once I received some news from someone close to Me.

Not sure if this is an isolated inc...”"

There is no trace of sleepy couch lock with this one.  It comes on slow and turns into an energetic and talkative high that I've found in few other strains.  Maybe not for everyone but this sativa does wonders for my ADD and productivity.”"
AlaskaGanjaGirl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/space-jill/reviews/1209784,"“My favorite kind of sativa high -- high energy, euphoria, clear mind, long lasting. Great strain!”"
AngelWolf666,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/space-jill/reviews/1342215,"“Good lunchtime/mid-day strain. 

It kept me pretty focused and clear-headed for the short time the high lasted.

It did knock down some of the pain in my back and left leg, and did help take out some of the headache pressure that had been plaguing me for so long, yet it didn't leave me feeling completely loopy.”"

Smoke a whole bowl of this, even amongst a couple friends, and you'll turn super productive and creative. Both second and third times smoking a whole bowl, myself and housemates started cooking/cleaning/organizing, and that's something we NEVER do willingly.”"

JustPlainNix,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/space-jill/reviews/1191300,"“Smells and tastes amazing, pretty harsh though. Enjoyed it via a prerolled joint and it was harsh on the lungs but potent, very delicious, immediate head relief for anxiety and depression.”"

Doublepinkeye,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/space-jill/reviews/1188442,"“The buzz is strong with this strain. Not too bad on the paranoia to which I am prone. I've typically been most satisfied with indicas but I like this strain a lot. Given the right surroundings, this could be the perfect night out smoke.”"
kibblesnbits,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/space-jill/reviews/1133787,"“For me its a little bit harsh and citrusy, but sweet aftertaste. Lots of dryness,  but I have my water bottle with me. Feeling pretty light headed spacy head high, still able to be social tho”"
CamGirlKitten,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/space-jill/reviews/1133103,"“Very mellow and smooth, both in high and in toke. TONS of little red hairs made it very distinguishable. Made me eat everything in the house while watching Star Trek, so it's pretty true to its name. Now if only I had more, I'd love to make cannibutter out of this stuff. Excellent candidate for medibles if you want an endless munchy cycle. High kind of rolls on hills with peaks and valleys, but has lasted in excess o...”"

Just went back for another eighth yesterday after trying it for the first time. It's unique in that it doesn't make you sleepy. It is potent for sure, but makes you feel uplifted/giggly/talkative. Definitely a unique high, I love having this stuff in my stash.”"
