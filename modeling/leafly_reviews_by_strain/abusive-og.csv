budznbrew420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/abusive-og/reviews/1397174,"“Abusive OG is an absolute classic. Looks are dark green with many red-orange hairs and thrichomes. Smells pungent and and a bit fruity. Very harsh kush tasting OG.  Racy mental stimulation fades into a clear-minded couchlocked state. Great for full body pain relief. Cleans the mind of all worries. Very Potent and long lasting. Save for long lazy days. A must try!”"
rmsears03,https://www.leafly.com/indica/abusive-og/reviews/1397175,"“The high is an extremely pleasant combination of the traditional indica relaxed and hungry high with the alertness of a sativa high.  This is my new favorite strain, as it has none of the grogginess of an indica and none of the anxiety which can accompany more potent sativas.  A truly exceptional strain, I recommend it to anyone who is dealing with chronic anxiety yet still has to function throughout the day.”"

Me and my brother both went to sleep shortly after. Besides its relaxing and body tingling effects, this strain is pretty with thrichomes in every crevice. The OG smell and taste is heavily present with this medicine.”"

This is coming from a mainly sativa smoker. Smooth with a piney lemony aftertaste but this nay differ to others as I was medicating with a pre roll and food prior to trying this indica.  You really feel this in the eyes.”"

Spicy freight train came on fast~
Knocked me to the ground
