It is one of the more subtle indicas that I've smoked, as I still had energy to go out and accomplish tasks. I also slept really well.”"

manofhippo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/popcorn-kush/reviews/1683763,"“Popcorn Kush Notes

-Smell: like very sweet corn, full of terpenes such as alpha-pinene, my favorite smelling weed so far. Vaped, it gives a strong earthy scent (petrichor)

-Look: Large clumpy buds with some purple color to its ends. Deep green is present along with some small orange hairs

-Feel: Active when playing Team Fortress 2 with others but lethargic once alone. Very much a heavy indica. 

Very much enjoyed....”"

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/popcorn-kush/reviews/1384478,"“I think it's called Popcorn because the nugs look and feel like a bag of popcorn. I've never noticed any buttery or popcorn taste. I find that difficult to believe. When you have a big bag of this, stick your hands in and close your eyes. That's where the name Popcorn comes from.

It's great, by the way.”"
