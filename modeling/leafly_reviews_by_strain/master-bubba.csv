It hits quick and gives you a body high and major couch lock for a few hours. Pace yourself with this stuff. It's good for relieving pain and stress. When you need to get to sleep and nothing else works, smoke some Bubba.”"

When I first got my hands on an eighth of this I was skeptical like most people when you're just praying you're getting the quality you're paying for. And man did I!!! Lit up a joint of this bad boy, and it started off very smooth. Gave off a really woodsy, pungent, piney kind of taste but not overbearing to the point where it wasn't enjoyable.

The nugs are a kiefy, tight light green, with some orange hairs. The smoke is a smooth pull, and isn't too harsh on the throat. The high of this strain is amazing it's a very Stoney, body high with a focus mind along with a nice euphoria sense!”"

The hindu kush peaks through, along with some of the earthy, sweetness of the bubble gum genetics. A wonderful strain that if taken in moderation can be good for daytime use. Best used as a rest inducing, chill out and watch movies daze. A great pick for those looking for a relaxing vacation from the stress of life.”"
