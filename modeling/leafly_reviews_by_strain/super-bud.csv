Captainbouz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-bud/reviews/1568723,"“Mix between skunk and big bud with a very good positive cerebral effect. This weed makes you happy during a party. Super Bud is maybe indica dominant but sativa is really present in your brain.”"

But after that it gives  creavity and opened mind. Great for artist, relaxation, insomnia and lack of appetite. Our grow had mostly citrus aroma.”"
