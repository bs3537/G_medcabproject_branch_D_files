Soldi3r420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-poison/reviews/1382425,"“This thing smelled so AMAZING. Smell is very uniquely sweet smelling, grape scent, just over all amazing my favorite smelling. 

Has a very enjoyable high, feel really good and relaxed with a good bit energy to get things done but relaxing enough for night use. Has a strong spacey feeling that feels like your floating on a cloud. feeling with excellent amount of pain relief. 

Bud was pure purple, looked beautiful.

I tried to upload pics, but they failed. Anyways, lots of resin on the buds and leaves, mine just started to color into a deep reddish purple.”"

An Automatic that can deliver the mind numbing, body melting stone that helps with arthritis pain and swelling, along with not having to worry about being anxious or paranoid is a major plus.  I am a compulsive control freak suffering for PTSD and this is my go to bedtime medicine. I sleep great, it halts the nightmares and allows me to face the world.”"

The buds were beautiful but even better than that was the "smoke appeal". All I can say is wow, I was uplifted, super creative, clear headed, and the taste is very different yet in a good way. There were 2 main phenos I encountered. A taller stretchy version and a littl...”"
andyNz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-poison/reviews/1349639,"“Almost to nice to smoke. 8 weeks from seed got almost 2oz a plant. Never grown a auto before so was amazed how fast they growed. Pretty good stone just don't smoke to much and sit down cause u might not get up for awhile :)”"
roxstar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-poison/reviews/1428125,"“Seed to harvest in 8 to 9 weeks. Large buds, deep dark purple almost indigo. Thick with tricomes, great taste and smell. Good head and body high, still functional, but also good for rest. One of my favorites to grow, yields 2 to 3oz per
Plant.”"

countytoker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-poison/reviews/1674463,"“This strain is a must try ! Beautiful colors, dazzling trichome production, and wonderful smell. The effects were a nice blend of heady euphoria, with a mellow relaxation.”"
vozdiverse,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-poison/reviews/1354097,"“Great high, steady waves, a little hard on the throat. Definitely put me to bed so handle all your affairs for the day before enjoying. A nap very well may be in the future lol.”"

going started the flush it should be done by wk 10-11 will do a smoke review when its done”"
groverdose,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-poison/reviews/1342397,"“grown this a few times now and it's definitely up in my top 5 favourites to smoke. but yield has consistently been low, under half oz per plant. 
makes up for it in potency and flavour but several at once are required if you want a decent yield”"
MaryJaneNL,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-poison/reviews/1435774,"“I grew this strain myself, which was very easy even for a beginner like me. Plants started out green and then turned to a deep red/purple when in bloom, which doesn't only look nice but is also a great cover because people don't expect cannabis to be purple ;-) Plants grew a solid stem, little foliage around the buds so very easy to harvest.

It gives me a mellow, but clear high. I just feel 'chill' yet I'm able to f...”"
yogiova,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-poison/reviews/1165954,"“Very dark purple and spongy buds with a intense flavour of chocolate and citrus. The buds are covered of 
hashy resin, and the stone is clear and relaxing.”"

badtrip420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-poison/reviews/1261339,"“I grew 4 of these at the same time, one got nice and fat with lots of red and purple in it, the other three where much smaller, but all of them smelled so sweet like fruity pebbles cereal. It yielded 2 dry ounce of killer bud love it I would grow it again.”"

KisspepSage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-poison/reviews/1314152,"“The Red Poison is the very best srain that I ever have growed. I'm expecting for better ones but this plant has an amazing purple-black colour from hindu kush and the powerful taste of licorice. The effect is amazing too, mixing the thankful sense of happyness with the indica's relaxed effect. And very easy to grow in outdoor.”"
OldLion,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-poison/reviews/1271652,"“In my state is is illegal to grow, thus I again have to be in the closet. This is a good strain for guerrilla growers.
