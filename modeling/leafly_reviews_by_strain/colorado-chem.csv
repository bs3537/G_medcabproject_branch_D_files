kennyledet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/colorado-chem/reviews/1195714,"“It's actually a soothing hybrid, relaxed the crap out of my body and mind. I did notice that there was a bit missing in terms of how hard it hit though.”"

ajaramillo0413,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/colorado-chem/reviews/1621007,"“So I'm reading some reviews. There are a lot about being misinformed on how Colorado Chem "knocks them out". 
My advice for you is to do a lot of research on your Primary Strains if you will. The Chem itself is unbelievable. A very heavy high, no matter what it's crossed with. Get your tolerance up and grab an oz of the "Chem Dawg", then, do another oz. after that, you will find yourself non functional. And see that ...”"
DieselDahgs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/colorado-chem/reviews/1700862,"“Pretty flower, ground up nice and burned evenly. Super chill high that I could go out and do stuff without feeling paranoid or lethargic. Definitely one of my favorite strains”"
JenDog77,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/colorado-chem/reviews/1696748,"“I've used this in a vape cart and in flower today for the first time.  Both are excellent in relieving pain, muscle tension, anxiety and gastrointestinal relief.  I do feel a little caught up in my own head a bit about 25 minutes into my session with the flower but this is expected.  It's a calm, manageable head high with  all over body relief for me.  When the head high passes, I will be able to continue with my day...”"
Stickyroots,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/colorado-chem/reviews/1718673,"“Strong Piney kushy minty chem flavor. Powerful smoke.  Top shelf.”"

Bochanka,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/colorado-chem/reviews/1449774,"“Great strain! First tried this with my friends over and it was amazing for social times! Tastes like candy at first then start to get a diesel earthy flavor and then it hits you with what we thought was a cinnamon warm feeling in the throat. Only problem is it sails your throat.”"
