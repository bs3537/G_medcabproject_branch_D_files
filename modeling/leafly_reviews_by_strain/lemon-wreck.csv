joegibbs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-wreck/reviews/1356671,"‚ÄúOne bowl of this and I've got full tard.  I get so stoned that my brain starts shutting stuff down and I'm forced into a deep and wonderful night of sleep.  When I wake, I feel amazing.

This is hands down the strongest strain I've had.  The only other strain that came close is called No Name (custom strain by this guy I know).  This strain does make me a little dizzy and gives me a little headache.  If not for tho...‚Äù"
Skiliner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-wreck/reviews/1356683,"‚ÄúLemon Wreck/Lemon Trainwreck is pretty intense. I've found that a single bowl in most occasions is more than enough  to get a good buzz on. If you're planning to go out and do something today, then I recommend using something different, like Blue Buddha for example. Whenever I use LTW I get a pretty decent psychedelic high, and I noticed some issues when I was watching the Wilfred episode where he takes Ayahuasca. Th...‚Äù"

The body effects are a nice rapid onset and leave a tingling sensation which borders on euphoria; the mind is collected but eager to learn and discover, a feeling of creativity is apparent as well as the happiness brought about by the initial high.

OfficialMakkyZ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-wreck/reviews/1356674,"‚ÄúVery hard-hitting strain. Smoked a joint yesterday and was very talkative and active for about an hour, good head high, but then felt so relaxed I just wanted to go to sleep. The body high hits hard.
Lemony taste of course, very distinct. 
Buds are very light green and pistils are yellow.
Very distinct smell, had the bag in my inner coat pocket and it stunk up the car, dank lemon smell.

The cotton mouth is terrible,...‚Äù"

While the rest of the world is in war, we remained the calm in the storm. Everything sound and everything still.makes music makes you feel and move in ways you never knew you could. Makes you appreciate simple things in life as artistic abomination without any certain purpose, but only really provide one purpose.‚Äù"

Smell: skunky/spicy with a lemon diesel undertone. The lemon is distinct, but the skunky/diesel/pungent smell is intoxicatingly strong

Taste: I have chosen not to give my opinion on taste, because unfortunately the half o I got of this was a bit over dry. I don't want to give what I'm sure is a very tasty strain a bad taste rating merely due to my over dry experience

Four puffs of a blunt with this stuff (sprinkled with keif) I was literally so euphoric I couldn't think straight. My depth perception and reality faded quickly, it was a heavy body and head euphoria. Very talkative. Endlessly hungry. Got sleepy and slightly panicky pretty immediately. Absolutely delicious strain. Sweet and fruity is my favorite. Just be careful- know yo...‚Äù"

yodaOG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-wreck/reviews/1274689,"‚ÄúA nice easy calming high, if short-lived. A little too dry eye for me (train wreck effect?),and its beneficial psychological properties can be found in other strains without the side effects (hot flashes, dry eyes negative; lessens anxiety big time, helps with lack of appetite.

It's not the type of strain that's going to relax you, it's going to send you on a borderline psychedelic soul-searching look at yourself.

Three hits of this and I was ready to do anything, or nothing haha. It was probably one of my favorite strains because it gave me energy to do things stoned then after the right amount of time, lull me to sleep which is just what I need.
