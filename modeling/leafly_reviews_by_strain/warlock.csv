Warlock

Steved333,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1415594,"“Tilray patient review here. This has to be my favourite daytime strain from Tilray. Although this strain is supposedly indica dominant the effects are more sativa like. A head clearing euphoria comes on quick which relieves my stress and anxiety. As the stress melts away the indica creeps in to provide mild to moderate pain relief. The high is uplifting and a little energizing, there is no sleepy couch lock effect. I...”"
Riddlechip,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1415811,"“Very satisfied, got the high CBD variant from the guys at Tilray, was tested at 11% THC and 11.4% CBD. Overall bud appearance was good, smell was fantastic with a more florally sweet and earthy sent which was very pleasantly. The high was minimal due to the low THC content but left the body in the state of euphoria without the couch constraints. bottom line, this strain would have to be one of my top pics at the mome...”"
AirplaneTire,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1346976,"“I vape this high CBD strain most mornings. It eases my Crohns symptoms and keeps inflammation down. Great medicinal strain!”"
ThaPurplePrince,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1346389,"“This was my first time trying out 2 grams of Warlock. At first I was skeptical because of the name but I still had a feeling i've heard of the name before and one of my friends said it seemed like a really good strain that people look for, but he wasn't positive either. Well, I gotta say he was right. What calmed me down at first was the look of it, boy did these buds look good. And from what I recall it had a very p...”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1332694,"“Very  enjoyable. There was a slight giddiness accompanied by a relaxing body sensation. I went out to eat Mexican food and it tasted so damn good after having smoked this. A nice, relaxing and not overly powerful strain. Although it relaxes, it did not make me tired. Very agreeable.”"
DamaLlama,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1381006,"“Good beginners strain.”"
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1372665,"“Incredible taste!, Lime, and pine it's very rare that i'll be able to taste this delectable aroma first trying this strain. Love both parents and this is the best of both worlds. The haze of the skunk with happiness and stonery haze and soft but heavy indica that is so pure! It's like a really great combo. 
The Look: Bud structure looks like phat lady fingers even the small buds are very long and thin towards the top...”"
HistoryMasque,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1349617,"“Heady and inimate yet uplifting and optimisic with a common propensity to proclaim "wow, I'm stoned," after ten minutes and up to an hour or two. The name fits this hermetic cave-dwelling indica, but once your inside the creative and philosophical juices flow leading to a stone that calms your mind and body but will uplift your soul and consiousness. Great for people with a heavy tolerance to Indicas and need anxiety...”"

Musky smoke with a slight fruity aftertaste. Made my nose itch. Warlock does pack a punch. Shit hits you hard! Kinda comes out of nowhere. Super strong high. I could feel my muscels start to loosen up midway through the joint. Left me feeling relaxed and even headed. Definitly a indica dominant hybrid. 30 minutes later i was all ...”"
drewskie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1274402,"“Small pack gave me a strong body and head buzz. Really had me thinking and listening to music. Doesn't put you to sleep but relaxes you. Has a citrusy taste and is amazing in a blueberry blunt.  Highly recommend trying if able to pick it up. #allido”"
patrickbasler@snet.net,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1062845,"“This is a very powerful strain for the seasoned smoker. I was really impresssed by how long this strain kept me high, which was around 4 - 5 hours off a 1g blunt. The reason i rated it an 8 out of 10 was because, although it kept me extremely medicated for an extended period of time, it just didnt have that special quality to the high that some of my favorite strains have. This was still an EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE strai...”"
Notorious_Ama,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1242339,"“This is a great strain, love the smell, the smoke, the high. A great movie/game strain. Doesn't have a couch lock feeing & haven't had cotton mouth yet from smoking it. A day high that doesn't stop you from getting things done.”"
NatureNurture,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1309616,"“This is a great option for those looking for some mind and body relief but not a crazy high. I'm prone to get anxiety and this calms me right down. Great taste. I can still focus and get shit done when smoking this.”"
Gnob,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1332696,"“I smoked just 1 or 2 joints out of this weed, the effects lasted for about 3 hours! Really good stuff”"

LeafyLau,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1617500,"“A real classic smoke, which possesses both sativa and indica benefits, soothing the soul whilst sending you into a creative jam. A creative smoke that makes you want to skank to the afro beats in the background. No matter whats happened in the day, you can relax  late afternoon with this tasty treat. Bop out the beats, reduce frantic ruminations, and say goodbye to any physical discomfort.”"
Zagnutt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1637247,"“Although it is a Indica-dom, its effects are very much that of a sativa.   Energetic, focused full body high that comes on quick. Great for cleaning or playing video games. One of my favourite strains for daytime use”"

I broke up a little bit eager to test it and see how great it is for daytime smoking.  The initial head high came on fast but wasn't as intense as other strains.  There was a very euphoric feeling that overcame my body about an hour in and I could feel all my muscles relax and I was ready to go for a walk and enjoy the sun.  After a couple hours I...”"

For the CBD lovers, this strain is for you. Very relax effects and clear headed. After a long day at work, it's the perfect mood for me. No side effects. I use it for relief stress and depression. Even if it has a light "buzz"  because of the low THC, the fact it relieves stress also help for insomnia. The smell was very sweet (candy sweet) and would definitely recommend to people ...”"

jahwillprovide,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1310092,"“I did not expect this strain to put me to sleep so quickly. If you're watching a movie that isn't super actiony with lots of explosions you will make it about 10 minutes through. 
That being said, beautiful earthy smell/taste and a warm fuzzy high that simply makes you grin from ear to ear. Absolutely recommend to those with trouble eating/sleeping or anyone with anxiety of any form.”"

loafmoomy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/warlock/reviews/1321578,"“I love this strain (with the CBD variant) for how it totally takes my pain away, leaving me relaxed and happy but still able to focus and get shit done. The smell is yummy, and reminds me of rum and wine Colts. Sweet and fruity. The taste is not so good for me, sadly. It's harsh and I make faces on the exhale; it's just so gross to me. So only four stars because of the taste.”"
