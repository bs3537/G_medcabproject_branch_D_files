jw62,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/skunk-dawg/reviews/1416062,"“Skunk dawg on Maui gotten from a neighbor is absolutely hands down seriously strong stuff. It leafs seem a little wider than your typical sativa and it is completely covered in resinous goo at the end. Takes about 9 weeks to mature, likes mold, reeks bad during bud. Totally worth growing.”"

chrisjewski,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/skunk-dawg/reviews/1412458,"“This relative of chemdog rocks! I prefer the sativa dominant strains so this one really works for me. It kills pain but also keeps me feeling alert and aware. If your the type of patient that enjoys a smoke they can use all day long or one that needs a little extra push in the day, this is the right one for you! 

The taste is phenomenal as well, a very sweet yet sour flavor. Pungent smell 😊”"

TheOtherMcNair,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/skunk-dawg/reviews/1412459,"“A nice alternative as a day time strain. Light but easily noticeable head-high, moderate body high. Allows me to get things done and a decent motivating strain. Good for vaping before a workout for a nice metabolism boost and a good focus factor.”"

It was kinda hard to grind, probs just my little grinder, so yeah it's super dense but burns great and  has just the tastiest sour berry taste. This is great weed. I'm grateful this will be my medicine for a minute. Two thumbs up.”"

vicnani,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/skunk-dawg/reviews/1315045,"“good yeld and good smell but I don't really like the sour and earthy flavour when you smoke it. Strong high with focus, also great social effect with mental clarity.”"

I felt stoned but with energy. I am an artist and...Man! what creativity I just obtained from this amazing flower. Definitely will go on my top 5 list.
"I'm not as think as you stone I am."”"

Cyrus666,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/skunk-dawg/reviews/1298610,"“I really don't like this stain. It smells good. Tastes okay, 2/5.  It keeps me alert, but in a paranoid type of way. My experience was not mellow at all. Usually the flower I get is moist and sticky and this was pretty gross and dry, and it was fresh. And that's just not how I like my bud.”"
OCHObabies,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/skunk-dawg/reviews/1260625,"“This strain is wonderful! I took a few bong rips and took the dog for a nice long walk at the park. Felt relaxed and happy. The smell is a little skunky and the taste is more earthy.”"
prettyboystoner,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/skunk-dawg/reviews/1380052,"“absolutely love this strain very good high smokes extremely well has a really diesel test and smell to it”"
flipndip187,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/skunk-dawg/reviews/1243122,"“Skunk Dawg Shatter
Look: Dark amber, almost gooey looking and soft to the touch. solid though, wouldnt stick to my hands even at room temp.
Smell/Taste: A strong skunky chemmy diesel smell, diddnt catch much citrus in this.
Effects: Super sativa, energy blast and nice euphoric ride, clear headed and powerful.”"

cccofme,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/skunk-dawg/reviews/1371337,"“Grew Skunk Dawg and it had the same characteristics as Acapulco Gold as far as time in flower and growth pattern but 8 or so weeks into flower the bud grew longer and more airy then the Gold and also got a deep golden hue along with orange hairs and is covered in trichomes as well. The buzz is heavy duty stoned.. That's all I can say STONED.. Long lasting too.  10 to 11 weeks in flower”"
