greensandgrains,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/magnum-pi/reviews/1391963,"“This is exactly what I like in a sativa; clear head-ed high, relief of low-level pain, uplifting, non-drowsy, non-munchie  inducing and relaxing. Magnum PI, at first impression, is boss. It's effortless to function as normal even at the peak of stonieness and the high fades away, no tired crash.”"

I felt a slight tingle in my cheeks all head with no body from what I can tell. would definitely use this as a weekend day strain.”"

Long lasting. The flavors are incredible. It left me with a lovely orange zest that lingered most of the day. Simply perfect, just like Magnum. <3”"

Really nice on the lungs and not too dank. It does'nt leave you coughing your lungs out.

I would put this into a great for work category.
Not too strong, but a nice even energy throughout the body. Nice clear head high. Putting it down as a go to. For Anxiety, it helps  greatly.”"

A mellow uplifting happiness comes from out of nowhere to say hello. Soon after you realize how clear headed you feel. Almost like your mental A game just turned on, despite what time of day or night it is.
I decided to smoke an entire bowl the 2nd round, and the results were just a little different. Feel a lil m...”"

I had an Agent Orange seed i cracked from an old TGA pack back in like 2010.  It turned out to be a monster phenome (but with a greasy orange smell that i didnt like, like gas station soap) so Ray took it and meticulously crossed it with blue hawaiian. He then picked a bunch of good looki...”"

I cannot seem to focus on anything but exactly what I'm doing --like not having a periphery. Don't know if I'm happy or if it's just that I am so focused on a task that I don't much think about anything else (problems or otherwise), so I guess that counts as content. No munchies, cotton mouth, or anxiousness. Bud smells and tas...”"

PrimaryVisual,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/magnum-pi/reviews/1482666,"“This strain is a cross between Blue Hawaiian and Agent Orange. It has a very strong tropical orange aroma and sweet, mild flavor. Unique in every respect, one of my new favorites.”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/magnum-pi/reviews/1665660,"“Treehawk farms has a magnum pi that tastes like oranges and grapefruit. Looks tight frosty and bright. Got me talkative, euphoric, and uplifted. Slight anxiety but not to bad. Decent effects. Great taste though. I wouldn’t get again.

I recommend this for day use and activities.”"
Roo182,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/magnum-pi/reviews/1322415,"“Not a bad strain, however didn't give me the buzz my Dispensary told me it would. For a Sativa it did make me a little drowzy.”"
