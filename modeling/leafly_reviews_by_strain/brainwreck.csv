terezyboi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brainwreck/reviews/1410592,"“I have this strain as a Concentrate(Wax) & I can honestly say it is one of the most consistently level, cerebral & physical, highs I've ever experienced. I believe this is evident in large part due to the 50/50 Hybridization of it's parents' Sativa and Indica Phenotypic characteristics.”"
rootsie23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brainwreck/reviews/1419058,"“Quite a hybrid. I'm a heavy smoker of concentrates and this flower was just as medicating. it's a good pain reliever and works well to mellow out after a long day and watch TV. It's also great for creativity had my mind juggling around thoughts. Not for beginners with thc levels reaching 28%”"

ShtickyShiva,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brainwreck/reviews/1644899,"“First the taste hits like sweet pine and lingers with citrus, then the head high hits with a wave of energy and euphoria, then the strong desire to google the strain and give it a fucking A+ review on Leafly gets you here.  It's a nice flower.”"

First hybrid I've smoked where the balance of a clear heady high was matched with an equal level of body relaxation!which makes this strain perfect for any occasion and capable of adapting to whatever direction you want to go with your session! Still trying to get my tastebuds adequate enough for that kind of info...”"

vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brainwreck/reviews/1384935,"“First off, it is well named!  Just 3 hits of vape, and my mind was in a blender. Not as good as Trainwreck for pain but is a pretty good distraction. Perfect about 15 minutes before soaking your pains away in hot water. Music was nice..... when i could pay attention to it ;-)”"

hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brainwreck/reviews/1671080,"“I've been smoking many different strains lately and Brainwreck stands out from the pack. I went for a mellow hike and came across a huge old oak tree. My thoughts became a storm in my head. When did this tree start growing?  What has this tree witnessed during its long life time? Did Miami hunting parties pass by this giant? This flower will make you spend some quality time in your head. It's perfect for insight and ...”"
