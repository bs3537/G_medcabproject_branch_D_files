Cursed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/uk-cheese/reviews/1383632,"“This is a fantastic blend. Fast head high, near immediate relief of pain, & overall just a pleasant sativa effect. Love it! This strain is the BEST for PAIN hands down...without making you pass out or getting the dreaded couch-lock. The high also lasts much longer than pure sativas with the energetic effect - nearly a full 2 hours without any reduction in benefit. My favorite to date! :-)”"

So when I was recommended this strain I was looking for something to deal with my stress levels and my anxiety.  I was reluctant because no others worked before.  But this made all of my stress and anxiety just melt away.  The indica side of it gave a nice relaxed body buzz into a deep sleep after a couple of hours.  Love, Love, Love this strain.”"

UK Cheese was very nice, totally reminds me of Banana OG, minus the euphoric high.  This is a very functional high, with the added benefits of 75% pain relief.  My cramps are down to a 2/5 in pain, instead of 6/5, yeah I know what I typed.  Helped a ton with inflammation and other body pain.  My body melted after 1...”"
Boomerx11,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/uk-cheese/reviews/1380164,"“A very nice hybrid and with great taste too. In 10 minutes expect the munchies to be upon you! This Hint of cheese smelling strain is not the cheesy-est. But the aroma while in bag or container - is amazing. After smoking you feel uplifted and calm. Relaxed. ready to watch anything, yet stay awake during!”"
HighRobin420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/uk-cheese/reviews/1380166,"“Nice hybrid 👌 
Pretty well-balanced between sativa and indica side and fitting in any day and night time. Cheesy taste and smell with la few skunk elements.”"
Stevenspowersports,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/uk-cheese/reviews/1315523,"“Great Tasting and even better feeling Hybrid strain! Starts as a sativa with ocular depressurization and near instant, light waves of euphoria. fades to a nice, giggly stone, great social high or for nausea. The flavor of this bud was like raspberries and sharp Colby Jack cheese. the smell reminds one of an old Michigander Cheese Hause up in Traverse.”"

Although it was dominantly a head high my body did feel quite relaxed; i felt completely unmotivated to move unless it was to the kitchen, also dreams i had were quite wild and creative. i would definitely recommend it to smoke, its a beautiful strain.”"
lilacoda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/uk-cheese/reviews/1070883,"“Leafly, your rating system sucks! this strain has more value than 5 choices. This is by far my favorite of all time. I have to be careful because Hybrids and Sativas can give me terrible paranoia at times. This strain... wow... if I had cultivation rights, this would be one I'd be turning without question as a staple.

I loved the smell and taste. At the first puff you feel it behind the eyes. This strain goes beyond relaxation. It can lessen and prevent anxiety (but keep the dose small or moderate). It doesn't mess up with your head : your attention or memory. It's ok to be used in a social setting but you'll be listening more than t...”"

Cheese is STRONG, so don't do too much. I just heat up a little speck and put it on my tongue. Sure enough, in five minutes I was feeling it strong. Euphoria, excitement, giggles. I was hoping it would make me a sleepy but it didn't. 

I like Aphgooey if I want to chill out or sleep and I like Ch...”"

One of the best strains I had the chance to try so far, really hyped and energetic (or maybe it was because I was in a rave lol?). Amazing strain, no bad effects so far.”"

The third night I didn't use it and slept throughout the night without waking.”"

I'd say the particular bud that I got had been well grown, as it was quite dry, especially for a homegrown strain.  I had been stressed just before I hit this strain, but a few toots of this instantly chilled me out. In recent times I've tried to avoid home grown 'low grade strains' in favour of more chronic strains.  But the nostal...”"

UK Cheese was recommended to me by a dispensary worker. Within minutes of smoking my awareness of every sound in my house was noticeable and LOUD. the hum of the fridge made me grit my teeth. i was on total sensory overload, all my muscles were tense and i could barely breathe. I had to smoke another strain (purple moonshine) to level me out. The next morning I was still a bit tense and jumpy.
