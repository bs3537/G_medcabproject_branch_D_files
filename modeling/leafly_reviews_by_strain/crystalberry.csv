lilxtiny,https://www.leafly.com/indica/crystalberry/reviews/1466966,"“I like this strain! Makes me very relaxed and sleepy. Perfect for winding down before bed. Slight munchies, but not as much as other strains. Made me fairly giggly and euphoric. I’m not a heavy smoker, so it didn’t take a lot before I felt anything. Tastes VERY fruity, like berry/grape candy. Pretty enjoyable and the medical benefits are great as well; helps with headaches, insomnia, nausea, and pain management.”"

I was in an accident when I was younger and this strain works wonders on all of my aches and pains that remain from it. Crystalberry has a nice flavor and a little goes a long way for me.”"
