Nuken
=============
204Michael,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nuken/reviews/1415468,"“Big, colourful buds (mine have purple throughout) Very trichome rich, large leaves, pungent as hell! Smooth smoke, definitely a flowery aftertaste. Consumers should expect a creepy head high, followed by a total body buzz.
If you're into indica's, this is a must try! Maybe shy away if this is an option for your first time.... But let's be honest, it's not your first time if you snagged this stuff.”"
BC_leaf,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nuken/reviews/1393802,"“I'm a medical user, treating muscle spasms, whiplash, and PTSD. 

I used Nuken in a vaporizer; just a few puffs brought deep relaxation, relief from a sharp pain in my ribs, and a heavy sleepiness. I just poured a bath to deal with the muscle spasm but I'm now unsure if I'll be getting up again. Laying down is just sooooo comfy. 

The bud itself has a pleasing taste and produces a thick white vapour. 

I will certain...”"

On a side note the pain killing effects of nuken are long lasting as I was pain free and stress free...”"

That's a great thing though !!!
I'm not usually a huge indica guy, but this is definitely one for me.
I dunno if it's the same for you guys, but I find a lot of indicas tend to smoke harsh, but this one's really smooth and easy-smoking.
The sativa in there really comes through on the head side of it, and keeps me from getting couchlocked and super drowsy...”"
LevDev16,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nuken/reviews/1393803,"“Amazing strain! Huge nugs (2-3 inches long) and very dense. The smell comparable to a field of flowers dusted with skunk spray and topped with sugary trichomes. Wonderfully tingly body high with elevated mood effects. I took 3 hits of this and I thought I was melting into my bed. Perfect for insomnia and pain.”"

Since I've discovered this strain, I am now 15 days migraine FREE! I have the regular daily pain that hurts but doesn't make me unable to function.

Rossvegas,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nuken/reviews/1389178,"“Nuken is an incredible Canadian innovation. The smoke is unbelievably smooth and flavourful and has some delicious pine and citrus notes (not what you'd expect from an indica!) Unlike other indicas, Nuken leaves me functional and focused rather than sleepy and lethargic. However, it definitely still delivers when it comes to pain relief and muscle relaxation. This is the perfect strain for hunkering down at night to ...”"

Dower420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nuken/reviews/1325227,"“I grabbed 2grams seeing how i am new to dispensaries. I also tried the purple candy the same day. 
They were both good. But the Nuken overshadowed the purple candy. 
Yesterday was my first experience with Nuken and it has become one of my favorite strains of weed. 
I felt amazing after smoking some. 2grams made 3 nice sized 2papers. 
I would say if you are looking for a REAL GOOD high. This would be for you.”"

Northern_Light,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nuken/reviews/1393806,"“Nuken is a true heavyweight among indica varieties. The nugs are dense and packed with trichomes. The buzz is strong, fast acting and long lasting. The smoke is thick and dank, but quite heavy on the lungs, leading to a fair amount of phlegmy coughing. The potent stone coupled with the heavy smoke makes this strain a one hit KO for many tokers. My friends and I, who are all experienced chronics, often found ourselves...”"

Is definitely an after work or night time strain. Very potent. A hybrid of a God Bud female and a Kish (double-crossed Shiskaberry) male.”"
KyleFromVanIsle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nuken/reviews/1304070,"“Third batch of Nuken now, and I'm even more of a fan. The Kish in it gives you that distinct celery-soapy-cilantro-something fragrance & taste as well as a distinct kind of buzz (I previously scored some Kish of God, which I imagine is very similar to Nuken)...Anyway, I highly (LOL) recommend you acquire some Nuken. A great indica buzz but couch lock isn't a certainty!

Having God Bud as the other parent gives Nuken ...”"
Knagawa,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nuken/reviews/1373101,"“Purple Nuken is a cross of purple kush and Nuken. This strain induces equal parts cerebral and body highs. A great strain to relax muscular aches. Although, it does not offer the couch lock effects of its parent purple kush.”"

This weed is literally my perfect strain. I find that I start with a weird and unexpected head high for about 20 minutes. It helps if you smoke a lot of it too.

It had me in space for a bit but soon took me back to earth and had me feeling super happy. I would only smoke this at home with a movie.

Perfect for depression. I’ll be buying this strain again.
