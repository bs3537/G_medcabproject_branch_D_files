Kilimanjaro
=============
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kilimanjaro/reviews/1416408,"“Oh yeah.  I love this kind of weed.  extremely uplifting and euphoric.   You're clear headed and cannot stop smiling.  Even sad things seem silly (I'm almost ashamed to say this)....If you want to be pulled out of a bad mood, this is the weed for you. 

Physically, it feels like your head and neck are stretching away from your body.  It gives you a relaxed energy as well.  I would buy this again.”"
AllyLuv420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kilimanjaro/reviews/1394111,"“I suffer from severe depression and have been looking for a strain that will help me get my Alpha personality back. I love making plans and organizing but with depression sometimes I struggle to even get out of bed. This strain had me encouraging myself and thinking of solutions for things I that were bugging me while I was taking a shower. This strain lives up to its description.”"

TreMcSinseMilla,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kilimanjaro/reviews/1365549,"“Pungent skunk and citrus smell. High in THC. Out of the 30+ strains i've tried, this has to be the most euphoric strain i've come across. Keeps you awake and alert.. at the same time, you can lay down and easily sink into a dream state. I rarely have odd closed eye visuals when it comes to MJ. This strain had my mind racing a bit.. but not in a bad (trippy) way. Very interesting strain.”"
SMBunch,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kilimanjaro/reviews/1419851,"“Very uplifting, great to turn around a bad mood - 2nd fav Sativa so far (I've always been indica/hybrid only in the past) next to Jack Herer, for depression, stress, pain relief, nausea. I use it as my "daytime smoke" for severe Crohn's disease and this one doesn't slow me down or make me sleepy like my indicas tend to, but doesn't make me too spacey, scattered, or paranoid like other sativas have. 👍👍”"

Picked up in El Mirage AZ. Easily one of the best sativas. Daytime pain relieving strain for sure. I take 5 MG of Hashishans Lo drops in morning so don't feel psychoactive effects from this strain. Heart beating very nice and enough cerebral that I'm sitting real good. Nice and relaxed and focused.”"

genghisjon,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kilimanjaro/reviews/1466549,"“This strain will have you feeling GOOD! The high is mellow and invigorating. You'll feel an indica-like euphoria with a sativa-like energy boost. It's not the best for pain but will give some relief.”"
ChrisMacDowell,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kilimanjaro/reviews/1277414,"“These nugs are very dense, with bright orange hairs and crystals on dark green leaves. The nugs have a pungent,  lemon-pepper scent, and once ground up, smell strongly of tar. Smoke tasted like citrusy tobacco, and was surprisingly smooth. The buzz was immediate and sedating, and I was couch-locked as a result. A+++++!!!!”"
Ryno602,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kilimanjaro/reviews/1312265,"“Very potent sativa both in smell and effect. I especially like the full force hit of this cerebral bud not a creeper it's pedal to medal. 🌵”"
AZredevil666,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kilimanjaro/reviews/1615268,"“These are some gorgeous nuggs.  Bright green with bright orange hairs and really nice crystal coverage throughout.  The smell is kind of a sharp twangy spice aroma.  2 puffs from the bubbler had me buzzing for an hour and a half.  True African gungee '65 from the motherland.”"
