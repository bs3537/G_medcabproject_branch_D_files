mattny,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-fondue/reviews/1393677,"“This herb is bomb. Hits pretty fast with a very electric, euphoric, uplifting and soaring head buzz. Like the description says, the high is very trance-like and blissful in its own unique way. The taste was different, nothing like I've tasted before in a herb. It did have unmistakable undertones of sweet coffee and chocolate. The body high that accompanies is both relaxing and high function able. In all, the combinat...”"

I have been sadly disappointed for over a year now.......BUT they had grown and were selling two phenotypes of Chocolate Fondue instead. Given that the descriptions of the two strains are very much alike I thought I would buy 10 grams. Glad I did since they were sold out in a matter of a few hours...”"

Last long medicated effects. Smoke this strain all day gets you going to do errands with no coming back for more”"
KorriVi,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-fondue/reviews/1337981,"“Pretty cool cheese smell !
The flower after its ground tends to ... stick together, but not like you would expect its like spider silk stuck together. It burns pretty evenly.  

Bong Hit : for me it was a bit rough to milk. The flavor is interesting wasn't expecting it. It was harsh but not the worst by far. Although it does feel like it expands in my lungs which was new.”"

Smells cheesey and subtle tastes of chocolate on the exhale.
Shared with brother-in law and he was overwhelmed with the taste. Good for conversation, getting deep into creative work - not recommended if you want to lounge around watching movies.
One of my favourite sativas so far!”"

canadient83,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-fondue/reviews/1743172,"“First time I had it I got a bit paranoid, then the rest of the time I was just happy, uplifted, and really talkative.  Second time I may have had a bit too much but I got extremely paranoid and anxious for about a half hour, to the point where it negatively impacted the experience as a whole.  After that, I was extremely talkative and happy again, but if you're prone to anxiety I would take it easy with this strain.”"

CDawg79,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-fondue/reviews/1345010,"“Super smooth with a pleasant powerful full body kick. Purchased 5gr and I wish I had more as it sold out super fast. Definitely hits the head first with a nice euphoria flowing over the body soon after. No paranoia/anxiety and a very nice happy uplifting buzz. I will definitely get more when available. Certainly helps depression”"

Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-fondue/reviews/1337980,"“I really like this one.  Gives all of the euphoria and happiness of Chocolope, but with a more relaxing vibe.  No edge at all. You can be active or you can just chill and you'll be happy either way.  You can also do in the evening with no issues going to bed.  As it wears off, it leaves you completely mellow. Nice taste too.  Earthy, coffee flavors with some definite dairy tinge.”"
primalritual,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-fondue/reviews/1288102,"“This is one of my favorite afternoon strains. The energy rises quickly with a focused euphoria and light relaxing body feel. If this strain were a band, it would be Black Sabbath. You can sense the UK Cheese uplifting, misty-ness. The Chocolope aspect might be responsible for the focused, sharpening visual effect. Great for playing live music, or something like Magic: The Gathering. 😅 The energy is best channeled in...”"

orangejello,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-fondue/reviews/1738999,"“From Tweed. Awful, dusty dry. Harsh. Smells like a damp moldy basement. This is not what good cannabis is suppose to be. Really disappointed with this product.”"
sinisterclouds,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-fondue/reviews/1741024,"“Great sativa, fast acting, high grade and wow what a unique flavor. Mainly coffee and dark chocolate which I've never tasted in herb. Very smooth on the exhale. Would definitely buy again.”"

MIchidankstank,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-fondue/reviews/1276929,"“After grinding this strain up the smell reminded me of a really good cheesecake. Incredible, pleasant, very pronounced aroma.
After firing this pretty strain up I got hit with  a spicy but almost sweet flavor and finished with a hint of earthy goodness. Very smooth...very pleasant smoke.
 The elevation is subtle but also focusing. Euphoria creeps up slowly but I would not call the buzz here super intense. A nice mell...”"

This is the only strain that got me aroused and SUPER euphoric, but I cannot get over the taste! It literally made me vomit once. Everything else is fine but the taste, however that is a big factor for me.”"
