I really think the stuff makes me focus like a machine in the gym, it makes that burn much less of an issue.  Pretty good for pain.”"

Very focused, happy, stress- free creative smoke that lasted for a while. I myself, got a sweet grapefruit candy like smell as well as the taste. Definitely a good mid-day, social, day to day activities choice.”"
