I bought this at the advice of my budtender at Altitude Littleton. I requested something that's good for stimulating the creative juices, and he suggested this. Buds are fuzzy and dense with a nice purple hue to them. Pleasant scent of lavender, pine, with a hint of oak. It does not have a skunky or kushy smell to it, and the scent profile...”"

I’m an indica fan due to bad stress/anxiety issues and try to stay away from sativas but dabble in hybrids when looking for a day-to-day type of strain.

Bullfly7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lavender-jones/reviews/1300424,"“I very much enjoyed this strain. I bought an 1/8th for me and my husband, generally we vape but smoked this via bong before bed and it was a very lovely experience. Lovely smell on this one, smoked, it leaves a nice mellow melon taste in your mouth. After it hits, it is subtle, more like a hug that blossoms into love. Not a total knock down like some indicas. This one makes me relaxed, knocks out most of my hip pain ...”"

Kingtojpisces,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lavender-jones/reviews/1482250,"“This strain has a strong scent of tangerines and pine. The buds are so dense that you may find it difficult to get trimmers inside. It is one of those strains that is very easy to trim. You can shear the buds easily.”"
MoBiscuits420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lavender-jones/reviews/1494363,"“Fantastic Indica. The genetic parents are delicious, resulting in a super yummy child. Initially the high influences the mind in a "groggy"/haze like sedation. Not the heaviest body high by any means. Some people find that it doesn't support insomnia but its a great strain to employ for general relaxation and chill vibes. I'm always down to smoke this strain, unless of course I want to be energized. Regardless, hands...”"

Great great feeling and awesome strain. I did get a soapy feeling in my mouth which beats cotton mouth everyday. Wondering if anyone else has experienced this. Felt very floaty but with a cool chill. Highly recommend it.”"

 It's got a Good laid back lift to it. Easing the nerves and smoothing out some edges. 
   Slight bummer that, the effects seem to completely cease after eating. I guess that is why it was a 2-pack.”"
bbt15,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lavender-jones/reviews/1392085,"“This is legit one of the best strains I've tried.  I buy this as shake and make canna oil with it for medical reasons, and it was a noticeable step up from Blackwater and Blue Dream, the strains I've used for this in the past.  The reviews are correct - an initial euphoric high followed by sleepy time.  I take it with dinner and by the time bed time rolls around I'm out.”"
OldToby214,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lavender-jones/reviews/1285788,"“One of the best hybrids I have ever had. I picked up the Colorado Concentrate CO2 Oil Syringe from Lightshade on Holly.

It gives my body a wonderful relaxing, chill as hell feeling but I have to be careful not to over indulge or else I get all panicky/ anxious. I'm always high when I wake up, which is cool if I don't have anything to do the next day. Other than that, I'm rockin with it!”"
