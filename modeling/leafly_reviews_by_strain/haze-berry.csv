Heydey,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/haze-berry/reviews/1301101,"“Strong hitting even for those with a higher tolerance. Effects are accurate as on this site. most other strains blur into one but this stands out like a sore thumb”"

Zorua,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/haze-berry/reviews/1276009,"“Mostly very strong effects focused in the head. Makes me forgetful and unfocused and a little bit anxious/paranoid, but it's pretty good for my pain. It's not the first strain I'd recommend. Mostly I feel this is a good strain just to get plain ruined on, but otherwise it's not my cup of tea.”"
