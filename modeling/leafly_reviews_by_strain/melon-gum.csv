feal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/melon-gum/reviews/1394627,"“Picked up an 1/8th of this at Harvest. They had it categorized as indica, which I sure felt at first, but I'd say it's def a hybrid. I rolled a blunt and felt dizzy at first, although after a few puffs I did fall into a nice relaxed body/mind state! This strains sativa half said hello and brought me some productivity along with the other side effects. 9/10 doctors recommend”"

gonzatorresg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/melon-gum/reviews/1394628,"“Huge!!
Nice trip, lots of laugh and even some psicodelic peak moments. Definitely a very flowery strain, predominating sativa.
Best ones”"

pollensilva,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/melon-gum/reviews/1781256,"“It’s definitely a good strain, very  potent (that’s why I wouldn’t recommend it to new smokers), just one puff is enough to feel it acting on your body and mind, it has a nice sweet flavor, which brings a lot of fruity flavors in your mouth and makes it really delicious, even when smoked, you still can feel many of this flavors, but a vape would be the perfect choice.

Seconds after the first puff, you feel relaxed, ...”"

Shawncho,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/melon-gum/reviews/1366711,"“It's been a few years since I grew this strain but I'll try and fill in the blanks from what I remember. Grew in 5 gallon pot with FoxFarms Happy Frog, Ocean Forest ,Budswell guano mix, added perlite and some of the FoxFarms beastie Bloom at the end. Was a breeze to grow this way(beginner friendly) I don't remember having to super crop or bend it so not a lot of room needed. The finished product was some really tropi...”"

IvanMartin95,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/melon-gum/reviews/1294573,"“I actually got a slight mix on this strain; I picked up some *Sour* Melon Gum but OH MY GOD this strain is everything I was hoping for. Gets you just good enough with a mellow body high but not enough to couch lock you. Then it comes in with a second wave but this time cerebral. This strain would be good for just about anything. Great for anything from watching a movie to cleaning your entire house. I would recommend...”"

sirenfirehawk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/melon-gum/reviews/1140519,"“Melon Gum is a rather weak strain, but for 10 dollars per gram it was not bad. My high was mediocre and lasted about 2 hours. (Smoked 3-5 buds with a water pipe)”"

VancouverUSA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/melon-gum/reviews/1178865,"“I picked up Melon Gum by Urban Farms a few times now. I got a wonderful melon aroma and a well flushed, clean smoke taste. Relaxed easy body high and a giddy warm heart. Zapped the back pain that my bay 11 never touched.”"

Aroma muy penetrante e intenso, dulce afrutado y floral con el curado a alcanzado unas notas pasteleras que recuerdan a pasteles con rayaduras de limon que se mezclan con las notas dulces afrutadas y florales  que dominaban desde el principio

IamHitch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/melon-gum/reviews/1307361,"“An okay sativa strain, amazingly sweet taste, aromas of sweet citrus, burns well, smooth smoke. Has a mellow spacey head high with a light underwhelming body high. If you are looking for something that tastes good this is a good strain, other than that there are better more effective strains around.”"

Outstanding mix of every aspect good weed needs in my opinion; calming, relaxing, moodbooster, with a nice indica punch for the bodyrelaxation. I have to admit I'm not even a bit of a Bubblegum-fan, most of the time it has a bit of a sharp and dry, unpleasant smoke is my experience, and tru...”"

I get that warm feeling ...”"

The right, light green buds with a beautiful frosting smelt of sweet candy upon grinding up. The taste was exactly as you’d expect, smooth, sweet, with a slight darker taste on the exhale. 
The effects come on immediately; strong cerebral high making entertaining like movies a lot more interesting. 
It then creeps up on you in an indica way, allowing for a large amount of relaxa...”"

I love the scent of this strain, very fruity and pleasant. I vaped herb at 350F, took 4 long draws and held my breath each time. Got a very light tingle around the edges of my body, went to bed and saw some colors and patterns that I typically get with an indica dominant strain. Definitely cranked up the ...”"

the affects were zero to none, only slightly tingly in my thumbs and toes. Nothing else. I'll smoke larger amounts later and updats to see if that made a difference.”"
