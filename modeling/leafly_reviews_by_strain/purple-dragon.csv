I was high for about 1-2 hours and afterwards you feel it a little still, it tends to linger for awhile. Great for relaxing, bad for multi-tasking. It gets you pretty tired, that's why I rated it a 4 and not a 5.”"
PamPoovey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-dragon/reviews/1387197,"“This taste great, has a lower THC level with a higher CBD level, which gives you a small (happy) head high and a nice mellow full body high.
