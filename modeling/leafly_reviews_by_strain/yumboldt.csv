Smells of citrus...very strong citrus..in fact probably one of the most intense buds I've ever tasted. Taste is no different the beautiful buds I had tasted as though I had literally just got done biting into some citrus fruits. As far as actually pinpointing the actual source of the citrus flavor....I smoked this during the day for 2 weeks trying to figur...”"

Method of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer.

Pros: Euphoria and pain relief. Wow, the AK sativa genetics have to be at least 50+% because it definitely leans this way. Very heady, it makes you forget your pain, however the indicia Yumbolt part does hit the body for relief.

Cons: Dry mouth and eyes. Normal inhale but at times harsh exhale. 

Other/Overall: Almos...”"

My eyes were drooping, my body felt pain free, and south park was the greatest thing on TV again. An amazing strain that planted my body in place, and completely relaxed my entire world.

Groovn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yumboldt/reviews/1416122,"“Bought this at Arizona Natural Remedies a couple weeks ago. I did NOT like the Yumboldt 47 I got here. The buds smell TOO much like fuel; VERY pungent, almost stings my nose. Taste is STOUT, draw expands my lungs, makes me cough a lot. As an Indica, I was told it would be good for sleep and pain. I (forced) smoked about 4 bowls, and I never felt drowsy or sleepy. Didn't notice much in pain relief. Tasted too horrible...”"

That beig said, it was a great flavor while vaporizing. It had a smooth, earthy pine flavor on the exhale. Felt like I was in the forrest. The buzz lasted pretty long, but wasn't overly powering. I also felt creative as I wrote an email with words I would normally not use. Funny thing is half thes...”"
Marijuanaguru,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yumboldt/reviews/1296178,"“All time favorite strain! If you enjoy relaxing and getting the greatest sleep of your life then this is your strain. At first you get a burst of energy and creative ideas, after a few hours your eyes will get very heavy and then the sleep which is amazing. only negative is alittle paranoia which doesn't affect the high at all.”"
