So off to 🚬 round 2. I highly recommend this flower...”"

Noxumbres,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/killer-grape/reviews/1798976,"“Killer Grape is extremely medicinal. An anxiety/stress killer for sure and extremely useful for sleep. The flavorful profile is unusual, the jars I've cured radiate a fruity smell entirely unique to this strain. Though she isn't the highest yielder you bet that every sugar leaf is coated. The resins will stick to your hands and leave a sheen on your fingers from how rich it is.”"
