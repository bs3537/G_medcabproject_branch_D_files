After a bowl, immediately feeling very significant pain relief (was in a car accident recently, nerves damage in back/neck) - however, extremely lazy and sleepy. The pain relief benefits and buzz are extraordinary and this strain lasts for a loooooong time. The real downsides are the sedation, I personally prefer...”"

Most likely Blue Dream x Mango, which had me pretty excited as I love Blue Dream and Mango is highly reviewed here on Leafly. Decent flavor, smoke although I was hoping for more of the Mango namesake in the taste. Pretty strong stuff, but was able to focus and pay attention while never feeling totally out-of-it. Overall happy with the purchase and looking forward to tr...”"

Anyone have any ideas? I acquired a sample of this strain at Oregon's Finest in PDX. I got a sample because it was sick frosty. The loosely packed buds appear a shade lighter green because of the crystals. Bright orange hairs of medium density are interwoven ...”"

I would describe it as a great mood uplifter with energising body effects without it being hazy at all. More energising than trippy but one of the best to use throughout the day cause it’ll make you talkative as well! 5/5!”"

casual420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mango-dream/reviews/1286168,"“Mango Dream is one of my favorite strains. Maybe it's the power of suggestion, but it does indeed taste sweet and tropical, a nice smooth smoke. The effects are immediate; I can feel my head start to "shift" before my first exhale. This one gives me moderate amnesia and low-to-moderate munchies - it's really not a big appetite booster, but it makes me horny as hell. My wife LOVES me on this stuff!

I get 4-6 hours on...”"

I get a relaxed feeling from this strain, not as an energetic feeling from most sativa’s i’ve smoked. I got a little slight pinch headaches at times (not every time) I also felt anxious at times, but I also did not smoke for a while before smoking mango dream, so that might have been the reason, or maybe not. The high lasts for a good time. I would recommend this for stress p...”"

Ive been pretty anxious lately and thought using it may help me calm down (the wrapper said hybrid but leafly says sativa, that explains a few things).  So i had a really bad trip. definately an anxiety attack. Ive never had psychedelics, but this shit was trippy. Definately fealt like what having a bad trip would feal like. I even started hallucinating... idk if ...”"

gigaza,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mango-dream/reviews/1077289,"“This was some excellently made BHO that looks quite a bit like a uniform tan sand. It tastes pretty bright and fruity, but not all that exciting to be honest. I'm pretty disappointed in this strain because of its odd effects I had. It gave me about a 15 minute rush of creative energy before a very powerful couchlocking sleepiness creeps in and steals it all away. Then I just sort of feel anxious because nothing reall...”"
stoneybolaney,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mango-dream/reviews/1335278,"“This strain combines two heavyweights in my humble opinion. Blue Dream has made a name for itself among the sativa strains in a big way over the years and when you combine Mango's taste and overall aesthetic, you have something pretty special! Get ready for an intense energetic high with loads of creativity. Definitely a morning medicine.”"

Nursejen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mango-dream/reviews/1220094,"“Definately a day time choice-

2 biggest dowfalls were that I felt paranoid, heart racing, agitation and then I had the hungry horrors! The smell and taste are yummy.”"
stanrizzo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mango-dream/reviews/1277443,"“This is the perfect daytime smoke. I feel awake and alert without any anxiety. It comes with a nice amount of body high, but probably not enough for patients seeking pain relief. I also feel highly creative with enough focus to actually do something about it. The flowers really do smell just like mango. The smoke is a tad harsh, but sweet tasting. I want to go out and buy more right now!”"
jacobtr,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mango-dream/reviews/1376763,"“I favor Sativa's mostly because of their energetic qualities. Mango Dream offers just that, but only for around 20 minutes. After a short period of time the energetic high cruises down to a very mellow sleepy high which gets in the way of productivity. This strain tastes great and feels amazing once smoked. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice "before bed" bud.”"

Ankush22,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mango-dream/reviews/1558923,"“One of the best smelling sativas I've ever tried! The best of both parents blue dream and mango. It's aroma and taste  is very sweet and unique. Great sativa for watching games with and being actively social.”"

The flower itself is beautiful and smells of mango, and the post smoke fragrance floating in the air smells delightful.
Definitely one of my top 3 strains.”"
