Herijuana

Moss1310,https://www.leafly.com/indica/herojuana/reviews/1416371,"“Herijuana blows me away. If you smoke this, be prepared to not be active.  The batch I purchased doesn't knock me out right away, but it lays the groundwork very well if needed,and insomnia was one of the reasons I wanted to try it.  Surprisingly, it works more as a fairly quick sleep aid if you smoke smaller quantities.  Last night I smoked a large bowl myself and it was a very trippy high.  I was left immobile, and...”"
Diesol,https://www.leafly.com/indica/herojuana/reviews/1416373,"“By far the best strain I have found for my issues.

deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/herojuana/reviews/1347280,"“🙏💀 Herijuana (Herojuana) from House of Herbs is a solid indica with very strong pain relieving effects. Dense and dark nugs, just slightly frosted over with a nice earthy armoa. I'm not too fond of the name, but this strain packs a mighty punch! I would highly recommend this for those who need help shutting their mind and bodies down after a busy day. All around solid indica.”"

It gives you a nice warm hug before you fall into a nice cozy long sleep. I naturally wake up every morning at 6am and herojuana doesn't make me feel sleepy when I wake up even though this strain has a THC content near 30%. (Ps: I naturally have a low tolerance)
