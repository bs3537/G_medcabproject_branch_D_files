It has so much citrus going on you gotta wonder if they mixed tangerine zest with it. What a wonderful terpene composition. It is such a enjoyable smoke, even the bottom of a joint will still taste good. The high is mild and energetic. Perfect for social settings. It put me in a very good mood and I felt weightless. I recommend trying this strain anytime and if a...”"

Strong buzz but not lethargic or disconnected from people around you.  Happy and relaxed.  As the long lasting buzz waned it still felt great. No drop off, anxiety or lethargy. Really good for feeling positive and motivated and 
social.   And that strong odor of
tangerines, it really stuck to my fingertips and was so sweet...”"
Neelson,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangilope/reviews/1396123,"“I would smoke Tangalope even if it didn't get you high, its smell will fill a room in seconds with Fruity waves of papaya and citrus and the flavor...oh the taste is amazing like smoking pinapple blunt wraps.  The high is fun but nothing too special, you feel good and motivated.  If you'd like, you can smoke enough of this stuff to start feeling something worth noting but all in all. 4/5”"

First oarngeish, to mangoish, to an super strong sweet mango-mandarin diesel aroma, and maintains it as it's curing. In doors and out this strain seems to take a bit longer then some 70-90 days...

Your420Story,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangilope/reviews/1396127,"“After a very significant tolerance break, this strain does indeed induce visual hallucinations. I can't speak to whether the effect is the same from vaping and bud but the Platinum Vape vape cartridges are truly psychedelic. Similar to visual patterns seen on high doses of Salvia Divinorum. There are no other characteristics, though, of the Salvia experience. The state is very grounding and helps you settle into the ...”"

A Positive and uplifting strain, but it seems like the Tangie in it just makes it a  more clear , and less fun than Chocolope. So if you don't like the Chocolope haziness, this may be for you.”"
galactica,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangilope/reviews/1396128,"“Tangilope. I tasted this strain from Total Accountability dispensary in Benson, AZ. Available in flower and pre-rolls when tasted. Sinsemilla. Lovely mature well-cured flower. Lots of reddish pistils in medium density nuggets. Opaque resin glands bordering on amber add to the reddish tones. Medium leaf trim. Nugget size, 1" to 1.5+". Flower has a sweet citrus aroma. It has a more tangerine aftertaste after the draw. ...”"
johnnyplantpot,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangilope/reviews/1396126,"“Awesome strain.  You get the best of both worlds:  the incredible flavours of Tangie backed with Chocolope.  I was hoping for a Chocolate-Orange taste which doesn't quite materialise, but the amazing tangerine zing in the smell and taste more than makes up for this.  From 6 fem seeds, we had one that turned out male - we were actually pretty happy about that as currently this strain is not available as regular seeds....”"

differentweed,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangilope/reviews/1396131,"“Very fruity and also retains that chocolope flavour too. Buds look great and unique when growing and the vape and smoke from this strain is fantastic. Definitely advise people try vaping. I used a plenty from storz and bickle and could taste all of the subtle flavours and aromas. If you are into experiencing different terpenes and haven't tried this strain I advise you give it a chance.”"
CCMonkey,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangilope/reviews/1181731,"“I just tried Tangilope.
It's AWESOME...
First, you have the aroma. It is citrusy and has pine undertones.
The head comes up smoothly and one gets a sensation of calm and wellness.
I felt my creativity rise and I could sense my mood settling in to a calm state. 
 I strongly recommend this strain for anyone who wants a clear daytime dose. I found it to be very euphoric, without being too dopey.”"
