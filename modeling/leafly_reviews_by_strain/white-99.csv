=============
RaiderRod,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1415973,"“White 99, the mother of White Dawg, will simply fu** u up,  Next level strain for sure.  Great strain for critical thinking, gaming, sleeping, etc..I can't keep enuff on hand.  White 99 has tight, frosty nugs, w/ the piney taste.  Let it sit out a while, break it up, chief it, and fly to space....”"
BungieTaft,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1415975,"“I got a 21% THCA White 99 OZ and my god do I get shlumped off this strain. One of my favorite strains. My friends and I will assemble the blunt forces and take a couple blizzys to the dome and I just get soooooo shlumped. Not a worry in the world. No anxiety. No depression. No fucks. Just goofy times and good vibes.”"
BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1415979,"“Again thank you guys for listening and adding these strains! 

White 99 has been around for years and gained quite a bit of popularity.  The unique musky, sweet citrus flavor always catches my attention.  It definitely reflects its parents well.  After ingesting any depression I was feeling quickly vanished and I was left with only positive thinking and relaxation.  I experienced a good amount of cerebral activity as...”"
MilehighBryFly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1390888,"“I have the white 99 strain which I am 99% sure is the choice pheno from The Green solution in Denver CO. It was often referred to as "Glass slipper". It has dense heavy yielding nugs and is frosted, if grown well and flushed correctly the nugs will have a berry like smell and taste. This bud is very easy to lose your turp profile in the cure.”"
MoBiscuits420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1494381,"“Fine quality Sativa for those who can handle a strong, speedy high. For me this strain was very energizing and considered a circulatory stimulant. I would not be able to smoke this strain and then do nothing. It is a very potent productive strain that is perfect for getting things done. Susceptible to anxiety? I'd stay away from this choice or at least err on the side of caution. Don't say you weren't warned! Buds sh...”"
AngryLineCook,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1392479,"“This is a nice clean anti depression strain.  The body high is nominal and the cerebral effects are pleasant.  It's a great way to quickly curb depression.”"
nzman45,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1390891,"“Very strong high. This weed will come on fast. Always for me, this has been a great sleepy time weed. I can describe the nugs as light and dense. Very frosted with green bud below, mine had less hairs, but still prevalent within the buds. Very stoned couch lock high. Somewhat creative. This strain has always dropped my eyes and made me tired after only about an hour. Great for insomnia/ptsd. I do not recommend for an...”"

DraveShady,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1390889,"“Wtf!!!! this one kicked my a$$. very strong all over body high. very easy to zone out on. absolutely in love with this one. the taste is amazing.. like chewing on flowers with a hint of lemon. the smell is out of this world had a slight berry citrus hit to the smell. Instant high and omg is it quite lovely.”"
breichley,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1516202,"“You ever see that scene from the movie “Friday” where Smokey (Chris Tucker) gives Craig (Ice Cube) his first hit of chronic?? Yeah, white 99 is like that. “My heart’s beatin’ too fast” Very motivating strain for first hour or so then nice and warm transfer to the lower extremities. As stayed by some other users, this strain can tend to exacerbate anxiety, for me at least.”"
unitdubs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1390893,"“love the strain. strongest wax I have had inna while. for shatter it was quite nice too. good clarity. amazing taste”"
wahha,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1414699,"“What a great strain. Felt it after about 20 minutes, had me on the go sense. I ended up moving around so much, got chores all done in my house and had a good time doing it.”"
alumpofcoal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1642696,"“Good for physical activities. Made me a little twitchy and smoke was a bit harsh, but overall still a good weed. Hit me more like a sativa than anything. Great for gaming and going to the gym. Didn’t really do much for my creativity, but did help with motivation.”"
Ky.Bluegrass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1390890,"“Great uplifting high. Very nice.”"
AngryLineCook,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1367568,"“This top level strain is a great mental breather from the daily grind.  Sharpens your senses, clears your thoughts.  The body high is just enough to feel at peace, without feeling stuck or slowed.  It's odor is strong on The Dank Side.  The flavor was citrus, pleasant overall.  Mid to low end "muchie".”"
bookfat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1390892,"“A really giggly high at first. Then you wear yourself out in an hour and sleep like a baby. Love it.”"

The shit can deliver an opioid high under extreme doses. Soooo mellow, so relaxing that it can take you under to an amazing nap if not careful. Definitely one off my recent favorites. Top 5 and I highly recommend buying when spott...”"

My least favorite things about this strain are its tendency to make for a harsh and, in my opinion, poorly flavored smoking experience. This is possibly my least favorite strain in that regard, but I can't deny the res...”"

yellowXsunshine67,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1612278,"“I just got this strain today in the form of wax. At 91%, this is quickly becoming my favorite strain. Generally a good daytime high, but it certainly helped with my headache and is very relaxing.”"
Laffitz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1556609,"“A punch-in-the-face hybrid. High quality flower by Sugarleaf, & one of the strains that got me hooked on this farm! I'm trying to remember what the effects were like specifically, .... ;) But, all I can remember is "Wow!"
If you're looking for a strain to test your tolerance, this would be a good one.
Happy Smoking!✌🏻”"
tunapanda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1723078,"“I had the shatter version of this instead of flower but, the taste and overall feeling is so great. It wasn’t a couch locking effect, but I was relaxed. 
9/10 would recommend.”"

Typically I dislike running, I'm normally athletic but within one weekend with this stuff I ran 14 miles with no training or preparation. I couldn't stop running! Had my tunes, and with only one to two hits I couldn't stop running, they should rename it Forrest Gump!”"
ryantr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1336975,"“Amazing, lasting high. Recommend for casual users to sit back and relax but is great to go out and have fun with!”"

MaxxxPowers,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1382153,"“Amazing in both effects and how long it lasts. The bud is a little dry but that doesn't affect the burn. After 4-5 pulls I was good for the day. Last really long.”"
hugh3000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1372756,"“Yeah this strain got me sooo blazed that I was almost confused. Potent and nice positive buzzy vibe. Didn't get me anxious like some potent strains. Great potent hybrid.”"

Dashingtaz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1380248,"“This strain made me feel very neutral. Neither happy nor sad.  Using for depression would be a good night time weed but for the Day time it doesn't really help”"
chuckroast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1389067,"“Good, strong THC levels make this a strain that will get you nice and trashed. No wimpy, bobo-weed half-highs here.
Sativa-dominant but laid-back. A regular go-to strain.”"

ecbeirne,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1373964,"“Sticky, great smelling and looking bud. Smokes smoothly, minimal coughing when I take a big rip. It hits my head as I'm exhaling and can feel like a dab. Great for wanting to forget the world and decrease pain, while increasing happiness and a desire to go to sleep and cuddle.”"
lkistabbott,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1361499,"“Very uplifting high. The smell of the nug is more of like a berry smell.”"

Koopday,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1646238,"“4.8 baby! It doesn't get much better.  And earthy zesty smell and a slightly similar taste. Very quick buzz onset in the dome, and kinda nice chill body high.   Much more potent than I expected and the heady high makes me uplifted/happy and focused.  It depends on your mood before you smoke that is lethargic or energetic, in small doses it will match your mood very pleasantly.”"
Jvargas201,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-99/reviews/1647769,"“I love its relaxing melt in your couch type of high. I also love the europhoric head buzz at the same time is great perfect for undwinding at the end of the day. Its a perfectly balanced hybrid in my opinion.”"

Smoked it and 30 or so minutes later I'm having concentration issues for things on screens. 
Would be a great smoke to relax or create on but I'm finding it tough to focus on anything that involves an electronic screen. 
Good taste, smooth smoke, doesn't linger too long. Its hard to rate a good strain poorly just because it di...”"

It pairs well with the empty, quiet house. Shhhh, don’t talk. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. I sit close me eyes and revel in the rare silence. I could sit here all day. J/k I have chores to do. That’s ok. I still feel good. After an hour I’m still feeling breezy. I take another hit and that’s...”"
