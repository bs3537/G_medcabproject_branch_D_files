Second bowl, I thought "hmm, maybe it's going to be a body relaxer only." Third bowl and holy bananas did we have takeoff!! More like meltdown, really.

I went back to the shoppe an...”"

I didn't find it locking or munchy, definitely helped my knees with their complaints on the hike for berries.”"

The package features a panda putting its detached head into a trash can...yeah that's how you feel. Your head is floating on a string detached from your body as you quietly hum "And She Was" by the Talking Heads. 

Water droplets and green fuzzy moss will take on new meaning. Unwrapped Starbursts will be your life for the next 2 hour ride on a magic couch. You...”"

I can see why I love it so much now: Afghani genetics (I love me some Afghani)! This stuff reminds me of the first few times getting high. Very strong, both in THC and in effect.

BobbyS89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trash/reviews/1282901,"“Trash is a great awake high, it keeps you alert, yet in a great mood. Some hunger pains, but not much else to complain about. Great smoke, got it from Phat Panda on the 4th of July sale.”"

5 Star, right above Death Star on my top 10 Uberbuds”"
