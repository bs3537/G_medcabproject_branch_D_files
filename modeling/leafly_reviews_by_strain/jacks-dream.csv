I was very pleased with the total experience of this strain. The high is very pleasant and stimulating. Great for inducing creativity and focus. The blue dream parent definitely comes through more the the Jack Herer in look. They are frosty and relatively dense. The color was beautif...”"

If not for its beautiful green, trichome laden flower, then you'll love Jack's Dream for its immediate cerebral effects, and smooth skunk/pine (*dash of berry) flavors. This one doesn't stick around long so I love it for morning runs, walks, yoga, among other exercise programs. If you're not familiar with some of my previous strain reviews, I am a fitness professional, ...”"

The munchies were real, and so was the dry mouth,  but not enough to bother me. You might want to do this during the morning or early afternoon,  I had trouble sleeping for awhile but that was to be expected. Felt very happy and talkative.  Would be great for pain relief.”"

Those fiery orange hairs are just beautiful and are all over the bud. Not really too much visible thc but once i bust the bud open all ta beauty showed. The high is almost as if your not high but you know something is happening. (Well at least thats what i got the first few puffs from my pipe. But today. I took some huge puffs a...”"

But a nice boost of energy with a mellow body and head buzz. You smoke this in the morning before running errands but also very good for when you want to kick back and play video games. Pretty good flavor, berry like with an undertone of wood. Only four stars due to the short high”"

Great burst of energy with a mellow head and body tingle. This is the kind of strain you smoke in the morning before running errands. But also great if you wanna kick back and play some video games. Great flavor, very berry like. Only four stars due to it being such a short high”"
StonerBoo420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jacks-dream/reviews/1776458,"“A good normal high. This is the kind of high I’d want throughout the day. Relaxed but not in da couch. It’s also one of the few sativa hybrids that doesn’t spike my anxiety.”"
justnisar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jacks-dream/reviews/1359069,"“This strain makes you dull and nothing else. Same was felt by 3 of my friends. How can this be a sativa hybrid when all it does is make you lethargic.”"
