(Instagram.com/midnight.roots). It is great for nausea, and loss of appetite, seriously.. it makes you hungry after you smoke it.   Wonderful for muscle spasms and mild pain also, but still gives you a creative, euphoric feeling.    The "true" CATFISH is a clone-only, an...”"
ButteryBlunt,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/catfish/reviews/1293832,"“IMO, the perfect sativa. Energetic without the anxiety that can come with sativa strains. Euphoric as hell for a sativa, with a very pungent sour fuel flavor that leaves my mouth watering. Yum yum yum.”"

PotPrincess88,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/catfish/reviews/1309732,"“Normally Sativa's give me pretty bad anxiety but Catfish is amazing.  It's pretty, it smells amazing and it tastes great too.  It was a super creative high, not quite a giggle bud but totally euphoric.  I bought Catfish at the Jackson County Compassion Club in Jackson Michigan after I saw that Midnight Roots instagramed that they dropped it off.”"
