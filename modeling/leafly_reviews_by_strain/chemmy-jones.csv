"Ah -- The perfect crime," you think, sticking to your theory that it was "all sound and no fury". So when you test that little theory by giving a little sniff, you promptly get frying-panned right in the face by The Stench That Came from C'Thulu's Ass. And as you're ducking stapl...”"

StoneyWolfe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemmy-jones/reviews/1397094,"“This has to be the best herb I've ever had. I was immediately drawn to the dank, skunky, earthy  smell of the flower and I was very surprised at the fruity and sweet taste! This is the kind of herb that I would smoke before taking on the day- the high is invigorating and refreshing and intense, in that the THC percentage is at almost 39% . I bought mine from Maggie's Farm in Manitou Springs, CO by recommendation of t...”"
thouxanbanfauni,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemmy-jones/reviews/1422546,"“It is a futuristic 2018 type strain. You think you knew weed.. You do not LMAO. Ok so for real it is a perfect blend of relaxation and energy at the same time, it literally made me feel like smoking for the very first time again after just two hits.. But it was so pure and good mostly sativa mix with hybrid indica that I could still function even though it felt trippy as hell. gives a really good amount of energy but...”"
BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemmy-jones/reviews/1324406,"“I found Chem Jones to be a powerful sativa.  Relaxing yet doesn't couch lock, mind numbing is a very accurate description.  The smell/taste was that of dirt, earthy.  Not the prefer temp profile but it's really not bad, easy to get used too.”"
acausedelle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemmy-jones/reviews/1388251,"“This has to be the single strongest strain I have ever tried, period. My friend and I smoked a 3/4 bowl in a steamroller, and I swear I couldn't talk for the next hour. It was the heaviest high I've ever had. This is not a strain for a light buzz, this is the REAL DEAL.”"
FirstClasPro,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemmy-jones/reviews/1365375,"“My new favorite strain! It's rare that I choose a strain that I will buy more than three times. The high is incredibly creative and uplifting a dash of euphoria . Whether you're dancing somewhere to some great music,doing a lot of work Or meditating...it certainly has a body high as well, not at all a couch lock kind though ... The smell is very full bodied and very strong wonderful '.. taste is always something I lo...”"

Onset of effects occurred slowly and steadily. Sativa dominant with heady high, much moreso than body high. Experienced an intense sensation of hyperacuity, great with visual and auditory stimulation. Also good in social settings – put me in a good mood for a laugh and/or an interesting conversation. Eyes felt ...”"

If wobbling back and forth while you watch your cat watch your dog who is watching you watch your cat is functional, the hell yeah it's functional!
