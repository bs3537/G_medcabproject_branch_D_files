the-bone-reader,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1353484,"“This strain isn't just named after an action hero, it IS an action hero.  Intense but not overwhelming, it allowed me to remain focused and productive throughout the ride.

As other reviewers have pointed out, it's worth noting that "Duke Nukem" should not be confused with "Nuken" which is a totally different animal and seems to be in wide circulation over the past year or so.

Before trying this strain, I would have...”"
h00dlum5est,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1355281,"“Bud had little smell except for a little bit of a subtle fruity/rosy scent. Bright red/pink speckled buds with a sage green leaf. Very compact/flat but stuck with resin.

Hands down dopest dope I ever smoked. I smoked half a bowl of this bomb ass bud with my bud. I got so baked and couchlocked. I proceeded to forget where I was, then everything thing else I ever knew. Felt like I was wearing a helmet, that's how ting...”"

Truly dank”"
Joeldubs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1414415,"“I have to say this strain is probably in my top 3 strains of all time. 
I remember one night I smoked a little more than usual before bed and tripped out for over 1-2 hours and couldn't get to sleep. Highly euphoric and psychoactive strain; also physically overwhelming. I'd suggest pacing yourself even if you're an experienced smoker!”"
calderplus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1376953,"“My all time favorite strain, it's very uplifting and powerful, I feel a release of pressure in my head and my joints are down in inflammation.”"
friedhelm,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1376952,"“Nice highs with little amounts. This strain kicks ass. You'll feel relaxed, hilarious and with no idea of what you have done during your high. Good compact nugs and a delicious flavour”"
BurnSlo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1364216,"“Very potent very tasty. Pugnacious smell that's similar to White Russian. Like if duke and the rooskis made a squad and went into battle.”"
wokawoka,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1376954,"“This strain is the cats knees man. I'm so poled righg now I feel like my ears are going to pop●•°!”"
DukeNukemFan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1308788,"“Just had this for the first time tonight, and i loved it so much i used it as my user name! The after taste, tastes like pineapple. It hits you hard when you first hit it, but then you get a nice and calm body and mind high.”"
tommygunn666,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1420629,"“One of the most clear headed and creative highs I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Was smoking at a friends house and once I was nice and baked I had the overwhelming urge to pick up her ukelele and learn to play.”"
KarmaChameleonTO,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1356711,"“Great daytime strain! 

I really enjoy how clear-headed I am on Duke Nukem, I am perfectly able to carry on lively conversations, be physically active, and basically go about my life with some energy and enthusiasm - but also without telegraphing that I'm high to everyone around me. No red, droopy eyes, no searching for vocabulary when speaking. It's great!

The only negative that I've encountered in smoking this alm...”"

annemarie87,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1264277,"“I usually can't handle sativa's, even the hybrid dominant strains, expect this one, this one is 100% calm relaxed focused energy no jitters or anxiety with this one :)”"
petethekoala,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1295895,"“I had a great experience with Duke Nukem yesterday. I felt relax, happy and uplifted. It's also a good pain killer as I have strong feet pain. This is a powerful strain but still manageable for novice smokers. the lavender flowery and mint taste enhanced the experience and made me a wonderful end of evening!”"
SpookyPuppy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1260293,"“Very fruity smells like a tropical drink gets you pretty high makes you relaxed and in a great mood.”"
SavannahMarie62582,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1707906,"“Every time I smoke this I turn into an absolute sloth. My thoughts are so slow but I don’t feel high, just stupid. I couldn’t recognize my surroundings and get mad anxiety. Not recommended if you are looking to get high for fun. This is also not a social strain. I’ve never been more stuck in my head after just a few tokes. My muscles were spasming and tensing for no reason I couldn’t sleep as a result.”"
Hippy_Music,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1623535,"“I’m a sucker for the name but unfortunately the strain doesn’t pack as big of a punch as its namesake. A very sativa dom hybrid, this strain is almost caffeine-esque, waking your mind up and filling you with intense energy. However it’s short lasted and overall a mediocre head high. The flower itself is nothing special either, very traditional looking kush with a skunky/spicy smell.”"
darak420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1196095,"“I give it five stars for potency and its unparalleled smell its an incredible strain . Try it for sure .”"
Caydn77,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1642130,"“Great strain....good for daytime use for me and didn’t make me feel groggy. Smooth taste when I vape at 387F. Would recommend this strain!”"
medloveto,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1263923,"“This is a terrific hybrid, it left me with great happy uplifting effects. And the smell is so tantalizing I keep wanting to put my nose back in the bag for another sniff.”"

nessum,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1528877,"“Actually kind of a chill experience for me. Fairly uplifting. Somewhat productive. I feel probably good for focus and some creative work. 
Harsh smoke, though.”"
shumz420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1485608,"“Really dense nugs, citrus smell and flavour .. burns nice and slow good wake and bake strain - can take on the world with the creative buzz”"

ScarletV,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1365293,"“So yummy. This strain has a delicious floral scent and taste to it. So sweet and almost rose-like. A nice, energetic high. Great buzz and makes you feel fab.”"
BudzB4breakfast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1263890,"“Really gets you up beat and happy throughout the day. I don't find I burn out from this strain either, as I have been smoking this strain during the day for over two weeks now.”"

Unknown1224,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1281989,"“Paranoid af. It sharpened me up to be way to edgy. Not my thing”"
TechnoNshWeed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1298351,"“A very nice strain that isn't too potent, making it great for day or night time use. Definitely a sativa-dominant hybrid as the high seems to focus around the head, and overtime spreads out to your body. You're able to focus and think clearly, which enables you to have regular conversations and not seem stoned out of your mind. The scent was also surprisingly nice. Tones of Earth and sweetness, and I didn't get laven...”"

casparproject,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1295896,"“I got this in shatter form, and it's pretty alright.  Citrusy and piney flavour.  Relaxing physically yet very activating cerebrally.  Tingly and pleasant body buzz too.”"
cbhsmuskoka,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1304891,"“Forever and always one of my all time favourites! Such a slow smooth burn off of some of the most beautiful lime green and sparkling chromatic buds. Its a perfect day time smoke for those who suffer social anxiety and ADD like myself, who need to function effectively while at work. Absolutely in love with the euphoric head high without any sort of intense haze or burn out.”"

DavidWard,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1571865,"“I found Duke Nukem to be a busy guy. I found this strain quite potent with an unfocusing and energizing effect. Good if I'm just wanting to doze around and not do anything but be lazy. Great for stress, the Duke punches it out.”"

Sowhatimtoeup,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1797451,"“For heavy smokers this strain is unlikely to get it done. I had a large bag, and about a week into smoking this daily I really could only catch a fair, half-decent buzz. Im more of an indica guy, this would probably work fine as a daytime strain, however.”"
castper,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/duke-nukem/reviews/1599425,"“One of my favourite strains, I usually have a dab of if before class and taking notes is a dream, I don't think I've had such good focus on a strain. It also doesn't make my eyes very red, so I appreciate that. Good gaming strain as well!”"

Decent body high. Better for being out than at home.”"
