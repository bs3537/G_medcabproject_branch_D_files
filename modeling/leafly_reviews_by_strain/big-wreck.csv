Big Wreck
=============
trophyhunting.2013,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-wreck/reviews/1384404,"“I would highly recommend Big Wreck to any one in need of a fairly long lasting potent medication, The sativa affect of the Train wreck is just enough to overpower the indica potency of the Big Bud. Its a great strain over all.”"
UrsaMajor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-wreck/reviews/1333685,"“Textbook good bud. A striking coat of crystals is immediate obvious even at a distance. "Is that shit white?" Quote, a guest in my home.

Though dank, and pungent even when underwraps, and especially when ground, this bud has some surprisingly pleasant fruit and floral notes. Jasmine, and apricot trees blooming.

A smooth smoke, with a very clean, almost pine-sol taste, this bud impresses on all fronts.

High is rela...”"

grayghost,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-wreck/reviews/1145186,"“Big nugs that are frosty.  Smooth smoke so very little coughing which is a great thing after almost coughing my lungs up with a very heavy Kush I had.  This helped my headache almost immediately and I was much better after a small bowl.  I love PTrainwreck but this one is right up there.”"
JoySters,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-wreck/reviews/1354034,"“It is an intense experience. Often with deep insights ... some pleasant ... some not so ... all worthwhile. It came on hard here but afterwards left a nice calming energy.”"

hunter710,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-wreck/reviews/1359865,"“The flavor profile on Big Wreck is right on point. I get very floral and earthy notes from this resin coated flower. It's an intense indica dominant strain that comes through with its immediate onset of body sedating effects that linger for far longer than other strains I've came across. I was almost too stoned to consider writing a review from the beginning stages of this high but that's when the Sativa started to s...”"
ProffesorUtonium,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-wreck/reviews/1343639,"“Very large and bodacious nugs, with good crystal content
could really see the sativa pheno come out vs its indica counterpart and it has a very sweet and almost sour flavor profile,Smells like peppered mangos.Great for on the go during the day or at work,but not recommended for a relaxing bong toke before bed”"

Localproduct,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-wreck/reviews/1359158,"“This strain (from Local Product of Colorado) had phenomenal trichome production, a powerful head and body high, and a smell that made you think it was time to change a diaper.”"
Localproduct,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-wreck/reviews/1373525,"“Definitely one of our best strains!  Buds are dense and extremely frosty!  Rolled a whole blunt of it and it burned smooth and tasted phenomenal...for the price it was totally worth it!  The high was long lasting, it made me nice and sleepy but was not heavy enough to cause couch lock.  It did cause me to get the munchies hard core, so it would be good for someone who has problems with nausea or lack of appetite.  Th...”"
gorgegirl11,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-wreck/reviews/1254710,"“LOVE this strain! The plant I bought is from Mtn View Naturals in Hood River and although it is an indica dominant hybrid, I have found it beautifully relaxing without making me tired or groggy at all. Also puts me in a great mood; laid back, happy and even a bit cuddly at times 😉 Thanks to Miss Emmy for such a wonderful little plant.”"

I've had it in the morning and it calmed my anxiety throughout the day. Prefer at night in small to medium sized dabs. Redefined what an indica is for me. Give it a try! 5/5”"

I had been illegally growing my own strains for the past 20 years.

Very mellow and relaxing high.”"

frankie18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-wreck/reviews/1061837,"“Im a huge Trainwreck strain fan, and when i saw "BBTW" AKA "Big Bud Train Wreck" for sale, i was in. This strain was a bit underwhelming, to be honest. Compared to Purple Trainwreck for example, and BBTW wasnt nearly as "trainwrecky". BBTWs buzz lasted a long time, but the high wasn't as trippy and potent as some other trainwrecks out there. A solid mid, but far from the best trainwreck.”"

MechanizedMedic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-wreck/reviews/1647373,"“I've heard people talk about the body-high from this strain and to me it was just more that I was super relaxed/couch-locked. I didn't get the tingly/floaty/lifted feeling that I usually associate with a good body-high... Still, this stuff is very good for when you just want to mellow out, fall asleep, or just generally turn into a happy potato.”"
