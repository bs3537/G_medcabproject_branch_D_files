onlyburnOG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1414098,"“The Zen OG I recently picked up from my go to spot, (whitecastle in anaheim) had me at hello. It was the first jar the budtender pulled out, and I immediately decided to grab an eighth. I smoked it out of a paper plane rolled by yours truly. Instantly upon inhalation, i felt incredible expansion, and a warm easing sensation encasing my bowels. Having been suffering from morning nausea for quite sometime, this strain ...”"
silasbotwin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1410979,"“My boyfriend and I smoke together, and he suffers from generalized anxiety disorder and severe migraines so I was looking for a great strain we both can enjoy without sacrificing potency or flavor. I have seen the variation of this strain Zen-X at the retail dispensary so I bought some. Sweet and Sour with a little bit of berry pungent notes, dark green and dense, orange hairs and light crystals. The effects of the s...”"

greenalexander,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1328954,"“what a perfect high to bust a nut 👍great relaxed head and body high.”"
BILLYSHIEH,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1410978,"“This strain is the best for headaches. I suffer from a brain condition that constantly gives me headaches. within a a few minutes my headaches go away for the duration a regular high last. definitely try if u have headaches.”"
jSGranger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1328396,"“One of my favorite sativa hybrids, 16% THC, 3% CBD. I am focused and alive when on this stuff. Flavor is mild and not harsh at all. Slowly becoming one of my favorite hybrids!”"

martha420fantasy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1722093,"“Omg love it. Make sure you got a good grower to show you it’s max potency. Made me feel less claustrophobic somehow. Like there was more space in the world. Nice feeling 👍🏼🌈”"

RudiCanada,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1258714,"“Soft, thick buds with light haze.  Spicy and sweet aromas.  Tastes okay at best, mild earthy notes.  Harsh on the throat.  Slow onset, not bad high at peak but heavy crash.  Similar to G13. 
Rudi's final thought:  IF you try it, pair with a strong sativa.”"
SmokyQuartzKitten,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1684449,"“This is my all time favorite strain, it treats my chronic pain and migraines better than anything else. I also have depression, anxiety, and a personality disorder and its is truly a very calming and relaxing high that does sedate me.”"
jcdina113,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1175521,"“nice flavor, you can feel the sativa high as well as the indica feel on your body. 
It's a potent strain, perfect for sleeping”"
stendek,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1334421,"“CBD count is high like a Cannatonic or Charlotte's Web, but has just as much head high effect as Blue Dream or any other dense hybrid.”"
JamaicanRob,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1294954,"“My go to strain has been Cannatonic, it just works better for my chemistry. Although Zen has been very good for anxiety and pain. The only issue I have is if vaping more than a couple hits, I get a headache. This is probably due to the sativa side which is why I stay away from sativa dom strains with higher THC. My accident that begame on this journey was blunt head trauma along with muscle and C6 damage to my neck. ...”"
ajemaner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1305757,"“I shot a great game of golf because of Zen. also got longest drive! Zen... it's all in the name!”"
michaelhoef,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1275017,"“great strain. dense nugs i have to say. comes off with a good cerebral high that last for a good few hours. body high is pretty well id say. more visual and body and less mental high. overall great strain. but causes red eyes and dry mouth”"
markpatrick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1253293,"“Zen is a good after a long days work and you want to mellow out. I get cooking and cleaning around the house done on it.”"
Steph91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1249890,"“I really like this product for the evening, and before eating. I have trouble being comfortable when I sleep, and this works well with my ability to fall asleep and stay that way. I gave it 4/5 because it is really moist. The flower is still beautiful and smells/tastes amazing.”"
HerbeHeureuse,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1283194,"“This Sunday's wake & bake is with Zen Tec.  I don't see anything for Zen Tec on Leafly, just "Zen", and somehow I don't think it's the same, but that Zen is probably one of the parents of Zen Tec.

To be clear - I'm reviewing ZEN TEC here.

Mine tested at 17.42% THC and .32% CBD.   It smells and tastes like balsam and don't let the numbers fool you, this one is strong.  I feel sensation, some pressure inside my head ...”"
GreenQueen82,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/zen/reviews/1167831,"“I was loving this bud for the first few bowls.. then as the day progressed I got a bout of paranoia and racing heart. Not sure if it was a chance occurrence a side effect of the medication. I'll finish out the gram, surely... but that little incident compromised my overall opinion of this one.”"
