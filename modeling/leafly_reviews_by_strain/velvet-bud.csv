I would recommend this staring if suffering from depression since it really gave me an extra boost to get off my feet. Or for people that like to get active in the morning, since it gave me such a good boost”"

If you're into that. 

Forever Blazin' Ace.”"

I am happiest on this weed when chillin with my girlfriend and watching documentary series or eating a delicious hamburger. Doesn't mess with my conversational ability like some other heavier strains do. Good for playing sport and having sex. High-ly recommend.”"
