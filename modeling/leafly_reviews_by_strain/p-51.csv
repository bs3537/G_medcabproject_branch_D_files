Kaliskunk28,https://www.leafly.com/indica/p-51/reviews/1363279,"“I have not had P-91 in a while; however, this was the best back in the day...I use to get a batch with a lot of big fat leaves wrapped around the "pearl-like" calyx inside. 
This one has a little better trim on it, but still has that lemon oil and redwood smell...and big "pearl-like" calyx

NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/indica/p-51/reviews/1360339,"“Amazing flavor and the thing that sets this strain apart is it gives an amazing body high and so relaxing it's like a herbal Valium. I love this strain after work or in the evenings on weekends I mean it's great anytime but it's best when you got nothing else to do so you can lay back and enjoy it.”"

MacTiger,https://www.leafly.com/indica/p-51/reviews/1288506,"“I think my reactions to different strains are like the opposite of most people. This stuff made me feel super scared and overwhelmed. It didn't give me racing thoughts - it just made everything way too overwhelming. Watching TV was too much for me. I had to lay down but couldn't sleep. Not good for my anxiety disorder.”"

Gordyb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/p-51/reviews/1247921,"“This strain is hands down my favorite. It relaxes the body and the mind. When I first tried it, I was so impressed with how superior it was to other strains - I had to get more. 
To this day it is still my favorite. Great for evening time and a little goes a long way.  One bong hit wait 20 minutes and see for yourself.”"

TwiggySmallz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/p-51/reviews/1243175,"“Not too strong. Was wishing for something similar to Headband. But got a weaker body high. Not too tingly or too much pain relief. Took a second to set in but peaked quick. After a few hours on my way back down (I normally stay high for 6+ hrs) So this feels short to me.
Gives me a relaxed/rested feel. But not tired. I have energy. Could have been coffee that I had but Im not sure.
Slight body tingle.
Slight pain ...”"

My first time with this type was bad. I didn't have a high at all. But this time I ground up this nug really good and took some good rips Cough Cough. And I am feeling fine. Good all over body buzz.
