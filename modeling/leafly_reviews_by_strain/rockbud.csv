They say its an 80% indica but it really felt a lot more like a hybrid, definitely some noticeable sativa effects. My mind was very uplifted, my mood was better, everything was bright and happy. Not a mind blowingly awesome strain, but excellent for a rainy day.”"

This is a hard hitter very stoned buzz, perfect for pain, stress and insomnia. In term of taste, it's very herbal and skunky, not very impressive but it does the painkilling job flawlessly.”"

CptKronikz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockbud/reviews/1379319,"“This is a very nice indica strain with a strong kush flavor. Buds are dense and super aromatic especially when ground, amazing when enjoyed in a blunt or a bong. One too many bowls will put you right to sleep but otherwise it is a nice mellow relaxing high that will definitely have you chillin”"
