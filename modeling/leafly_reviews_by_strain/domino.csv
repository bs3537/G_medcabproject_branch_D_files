And was fast acting when I was really upset!! Felt functunal but was a little on the lazy side. Affects could be felt for over 2 hrs, and I have a high tolerance! People with COPD should heed caution!! This caused me to have breathing issues imediately after each dosing. But everyone else will be pleased with it...”"

Half a J split between two lasted us a good 6-8 hours, and we posses a bit of a high tolerance.  Mellow buzz without getting stuck, and it lets you down nice and easy.  The taste was a bit sweet and the draw was not harsh at all.  It helped with my sleep more than it did with my lower back pain.  I would definitely try this great strain again.”"
