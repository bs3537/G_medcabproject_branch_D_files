YoungDon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frankenstein/reviews/1346449,"“Frank hits you hard when smoked. Will have you full of laughter (controllable) and in the mood to be creative with things. The taste is a bit sweet and tropical mix and can put insomniacs to sleep at ease.”"
Greatwhitegumby,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frankenstein/reviews/1374664,"“Smells pleasant, hint of spiciness in the flavor. Pretty intense effects almost immediately, im having trouble writing this because i just want to sit on the couch. I should have grabbed snacks. Damn”"
twitch00,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frankenstein/reviews/1353672,"“Amazing strain with heavy indica traits! Love it, not much of a sativa person it gives me anxiety. Super relaxing, taste very earthy, great pain reliever! One of my new favorites! If your looking for a heavy hitter that you can still be social with this is it! Love it!”"

5m1thy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frankenstein/reviews/1346586,"“Frankenstein lives up to its bio. A very powerful indica and the first strain to induce the best laughing fits for myself. This strain is an excellent addition to relaxing with friends and a great way to end any day.”"
lusht75,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frankenstein/reviews/1534708,"“Tried this strain on a whim because the local delivery service had a g for $20 (wax). I smoke from a YoCan Evolve Plus.  I'm a daily medicator, and usually smoke Indicas. 

This strain is definitely a hard hitting Indica.  You'll feel the couch lock almost immediately, but it's also a heady high. I experience a sharpness of focus, and find myself, for some reason,  interested in learning new things.  Hell, I just spe...”"
805darling,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frankenstein/reviews/1474052,"“What day is it? Who cares! This strain is incredibly relaxing and promises a great full body high. This strain is what every stoner expects to find someday. Something to make you say night-night. I find this flower easy to smoke, with a classic scent. If you are looking for something to promote relaxation and pain relief, this is the strain for you. A little goes a long way though.”"
Iamabso,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frankenstein/reviews/1353512,"“This lovely Indica has a well established mood when inhaled "Come Smoke me and let me take you on an adventure" 

What it's really saying is Don't overdue it with me Cuz I'm a potent Bitch that will take your brain on a joyride that will leave you in Slumberland”"

sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frankenstein/reviews/1542736,"“I recommend this strain for me. Frankenstein by the high point is sedative, extremely relaxed, slightly happy and euphoric. Smoke has near to no lung expansion. Very smooth taste of flowers with a hint of berries and honey. Buds are dense with good amount of trich. Deep purple to light beige nugs with massive amounts of stubby fat copper hairs. It’s great for treating anxiety.

I will get again.”"
JmoneyPNW,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frankenstein/reviews/1656229,"“Definitely love this strain! First time smoking it, flower, dense dark and red hair nugs, had me giggling for a bit and now super cough lock chilling bro. Peace J$ ✌️”"

hjointsmoke,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frankenstein/reviews/1285023,"“Like sugar, sticky indica heavy strain that is some of the most relaxing medication I've ever had. They should call it valium or xanax. So relaxed right now, nothing weighing on my mind but Im still able to hold a conversation and be focused just fine.

The first time I really smoked a lot of this strain (~4 blunts) was while I was camping with a friend of mine. We smoked this around noon, immediately gorged ourselves on beef jerky and donuts, then napped. The head-high I experienced while dozing was so intense I actually stepped outside to lay down on the ground in the rain. My head and ey...”"

Settles in nice with a lasting permagrin and then I want to grub out before I pass out. You will get the heavies but only after several hours of calming, yet somehow inspiring euphoria.
