Overall the high has been very level. Stress melts, aches eased, motivated energy, mild appetite, focus in a straight path, and yet maybe a little heavier than on my eye lids than a hybrid may suggest. When dry herb vaped it’s flavors have a chance to really show themselves to your face. Like bam! Sp...”"

Mamahazel91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/marmalade/reviews/1710066,"“This strain is sweet and does exactly as it says it zaps your depression and helps alleviate stress levels.. It taste sweet and soft in the pallet with a nice heady skunk smell when smoked in flower form... I was having a episode and it helped me within 15-30 mins of smoking I was calm and able to think clearly and relax it also does wonder with a tension headache.. the wonders of a cbd rich plant it beautiful and he...”"

Sweet Herbal Smell with a hint of Spiciness.  The Sour Tsunami defiantly overpowered the BB Cheesecake.
Low doses gave me a surge of energy and creativity, while larger doses brought a happy euphoria (like a paranoia free Sour Diesel).
Great for crushing morning blues and re-charging midday (Gonna keep you up at night tho).”"

I didn’t know anything about it or it’s effects. i’m so glad I tried it though. i’m not sure what this batch tested at, but it was pretty effective. even with a fairly high tolerance, 1 bowl had me completely melted & thinking about a science experiment I could do. nice ass strain.”"

mamamarijuana1118,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/marmalade/reviews/1653129,"“I bought this in a pre-roll by C&D Farms. The paper was extremely harsh. So it kinda burned going down, but the weed itself was amazing. The CBD level is great and the THC level is almost the same! Close as you could possible get to a 1:1 ratio without it actually being a complete 1:1.”"

BowlsOPlenty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/marmalade/reviews/1645281,"“This was a new strain at my local dispensary. Being a connoisseur and the fact that the Nuggets looked so good I had to give it a shot. And I am not disappointed! This batch was extremely crystally and a very light green color with dark orange hairs. The contrast between pistils & the light lime green is what really caught my eye. 👀Unfortunately my 8th came pre-packaged so I couldn't smell it or get any better judge...”"
