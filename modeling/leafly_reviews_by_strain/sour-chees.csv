Neemix,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1410940,"“I've had the pleasure of tasting some very yummy Sour Cheese from Green Health Cooperative in Seattle, WA.  So yummy in fact that after trying it I had to return and get some more.  

When you open the jar and take a whiff you are greeted with a splash of pungent sour that quickly turns into a smooth cheese.  Colored in a light to medium green and absolutely covered in orange hairs and glistening trichomes these buds...”"

I have back issues and my lower back feels numb right now. the bud feels compact and nice n tight nugs, the color looks great too.”"
Xallium,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1410944,"“This is amazing. Definitely one of those strains that makes you remember it. My experience was life-changing. I was focused, didn't get too hungry, and felt like I could do anything. My boyfriend and I had a very deep emotional talk and we feel as though we are on a new level of understanding each other. I also feel like understand myself better. The entire night felt like my sight was a play at an old theater where ...”"

It's a fun strain.   I'm finding that any strain that has sour diesel in it's genetics is my kind of weed.”"

Picasso2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1410942,"“Surprisingly, it really smells and tastes like sour cheese. Even more surprisingly, it's in a good way. 

When I smelled such a unique smelling flower at the dispensary, I just had to take a gram home and try this. I'm glad I did. Firstly, the color of the bud was a light, pastel green-yellow with a healthy covering of crystals. The bud was dried well and crumbled beautifully! It crumbled into the bowl like a sticky ...”"
younggrasshopper,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1243002,"“Really good looking buds. The sour Cheese i tried is from pierce county in wa. The bud is covered in crystals and thick orange hairs givng it a sticky,crystally orange look. It was really dense and the high is a nice uplifting high that hits pretty hard and doesnt leave you couchlocked or unable to conversate.”"

tokermobile,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1410945,"“such a nice strain i went back and cleaned the dispensary out, almost identical to Chiesel,one of my all time fav, basicaly the same, one form of cheese crossed with sour diesel, the bud is more compact than usual cheese strands with good dense bud yield per gram as the flowers were very thick and bulbous, this is an excellent pain killer and muscle relaxant, perfect for before/after physio session, strong but not a ...”"
ottobebop,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1240857,"“Got a nice sample pacc from my boy in Tampa and this is definitely a top 5 in my personal stash.

maytoldyouso,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1710667,"“First time finding this strain and it’s already top 3 for me. Very creative and productive with this one and not sleepy at all. I agree with all the comments that say it’s good for daytime. Also the high doesn’t last very long so I’m wondering if this is better for a vape? Any thoughts?”"

DMarvelous4L,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1424649,"“Sour Cheese is a really nice strain. Very sticky if you're breaking it up with your fingers. The smell is clearly a nice mix of sour and cheesey goodness. The high was definitely a head high. My body felt mostly the same. It was a very social high with a nice touch of Euphoria. I'd rate the high a solid 8.0 out of 10.”"

Music, TV, Parades, and some drinks all go well with the strain👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽.  Solid strain...if there are beginners out there this would be a nice strain to explore.  It says for negatives "paranoia" but I haven't had too much of that...Give Sour Cheese a try for a nice chill time!!!”"
Koppur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1309242,"“Great for my aches and pains related to my MS. Works super fast and with a little amount, but the high doesn't last as long as it does with some other strains. It's a nice choice for daytime, since it doesn't make me too tired. Within an hour of using, I feel clear headed and like I didn't smoke at all that day. Useful for days when I just need to get through the pain, but don't want to be stoned out of my mind.”"
Anglophile1987,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1520104,"“I felt a good feeling coursing through my head down to my whole body the moment the tangy smoke invaded my nostrils. I watched the "Breaking Bad" episode "Hazard Pay" with close attention-not only for the plot, but also keep realizing how incredible the acting is on this show. I had incredible sex with my boyfriend while smoking another bowl of this and we cooked dinner (Korean barbeque chicken with quinoa & spinach)...”"

dejong17,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1204298,"“Least favorite weed I have smoked recently. This high makes you spacey to the point that you just feel dumb, There is no hint of its parent Sour Diesel, just a less powerful Cheese. Wouldn't recommend this strain.”"
yourfriend_nico,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1363832,"“Very smooth smoke, comes on rather quick.  Tastes great awesome high!  At lower levels you have some enough energy still to rock about and do your thing (I make music and I love making music when I'm smoke this lovely strain) and if you smoke a bit more (2 + bowls) you feel very relaxed and sleepy.  It stimulates my appetite as it is hard for me to eat sometimes due to nausea from a past opiate addiction that left me...”"
kaylen51889,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1296945,"“It was a good euphoric high.  I was very clear headed.  I think it kept me from Cumming though. my girl and I had sex for a legit 3 hours before I finally was able to cum.  it was great”"
KingSizeSmoke420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-chees/reviews/1145829,"“Has a primary flavor of Sour with a cheesy aftertaste. Also, has that lung-punch effect that sour has, however, not as intense. Enduces a great mind & body high. couldn't be more satisfied.
