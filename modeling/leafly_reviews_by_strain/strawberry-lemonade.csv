I smoked wayyy too much. Like, a whole bowl by myself. Felt like my heart was going to explode and I would die. An hour or so later, the more I came down the more enjoyable it was. Did get pretty paranoid though. Was able to

I find Strawberry Lemonade (STL here on out) gave me the actual high I crave due to medical issues. I use the DreamSteam vape pen and it gets the THC into your blood quickly.

I first smoked this strain about 2 years ago when I was still kind of a rookie smoker and I tended to get slight paranoia from sativa strains. This did the complete opposite and put me in a very uplifting and creative mood. I've had very positive experiences with this strain and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good relaxing sativa high.”"
