I end up having an anxiety attack so bad that I can see my heart pumping outside of my shirt, I have terrible chest pains, and sometimes feel like I'm having a heart attack and might die. It sounds wildly dramatic, but...I...”"

monstapuss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-sauce/reviews/1396267,"“Ok, I'm normally a huge HEAVY incica or high thc fan, due to an annoyingly high tolerance, extreme anxiety, chronic pancreatitis (thank you for that, western medicine😂) so constant nausea and a few pinched nerves causing an always present neuropathy (nerve pain).  Not even Vic 10's do anything, causing me to seek this form of medication, instead.  My body likes to be a little asshat at times!

This strain changed my life! This is the absolute first strain I have tried that I could consider "medicine". Its like having a brain and body tune-up from some cosmic mechanic. Strong euphoria and relaxation that provides a second-wind of energy hours later. True perfection. I purchased a vape cartridge and typically dose 2 solid hits. 5-20 min, ini...”"

I have a disgusting tolerance, I actually got the wrong strain but ended up being more happy with The Sauce.  Very heavy head high, this strain is one of the only ones who give me my appetite back. Also a clean buzz, no anxiety.”"
BLAZINrightNOW,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-sauce/reviews/1365432,"“wow... I'm really impressed with the gg4 offshoots lately.  The aroma is so delicious..  almost a dark chocolate with a pungent piney fuel odor followed by almost citrusy lime. The complexity doesn't stop there either. The taste is similar to a decadent dessert flavor followed by just the right amount of pungent skunkiness.. This is definitely one to try out!”"

The Sauce works for work.  But even better -- the Sauce works for recreation.  I just played the most incredible tennis of my life -- while 'sauced'.  

The 'high' doesn't waste its (or your) time, rising up from somewhere in the brainstem and then rippling across the rest of your grey matter in thought-inducing waves of ...”"

Effective immediately clean head high that matches the smooth Flav.  Felt creative,  inquisitive and peaceful.  High didn't last too long.  No munchies or sleepiness.  depending on tolerance may have to does more frequently”"

Definite creeper.  Fascinating high that quickly turns sedative if you overdo.  Which is just as great as the initial sativa kick! I can totally function, a bit dizzy at times (bonus😉), kills my chronic pain, helped me eat & time for nookie.  Will get more!”"

maidenoregon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-sauce/reviews/1414881,"“I absolutely love this strain. Nice lime green nuggets that are sticky and the smell that makes you say yum every time you open your jar. really good strain for daytime use but also can kick your butt if you aren't careful. I recommend for anxiety and stress relief. go get yourself some! You won't be disappointed”"
boyndog,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-sauce/reviews/1584432,"“The Sauce's GG4 genetics make themselves known with a quickening that comes over the top of your head then plunges down into your consciousness with a strong sense of well-being and focus.  Definitely a day time strain -- great for work or hanging with friends or taking on the world. A hint of lime fringes the diesel on both the nose and the taste buds.”"

pibo47,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-sauce/reviews/1262834,"“the way in which this strain affects me is strange. this begins with a sort of strong breeze of head high that culminates with a body buzz that after while fades from an alert creative state to a smooth lazy one.”"

earlofamerica,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-sauce/reviews/1297065,"“Picked up an eighth and took three bong rips. An earthy note and diesel mixed to almost give it a garlic flavor with lime. The cerebral buzz was the shit and the physical buzz was really relaxing, not overwhelming. A good strain to hand out with friends or enjoy anything on TV. I'd buy this again.”"

Just don't plan on doing much anything except maybe smiling.”"
austinBOAjvk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-sauce/reviews/1642585,"“Where do I start? This strain is something special. It’s has a real uniqueness to it. A textbook sativa, but without any chance of the usual worries of paranoia. The smell is piney and citrusy, while the smoke is quite earthy, and chocolatey with notes of sour lime on the exhale. 
Now I’m not much of a sativa fan. I love my heavy hitting indica and very rarely even consider going with the orange instead of the purple...”"

I understand that this is a combination of Gorilla Glue #4 and Green Ribbon. I would say that the description from the dispensary and First State Compassion Center in Delaware is correct regarding ant-depression/anxiety.

There was no deep thinking either and I just felt strangely blank. No anxiety to report. I picked up the strain because it was given high marks for inflammation, but I only found it moderately effective for Crohn's disease and Ménière's disease.
