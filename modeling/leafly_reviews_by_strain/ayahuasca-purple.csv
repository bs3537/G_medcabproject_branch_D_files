kirkabe,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1417679,"“I have been waiting for this one to be posted on leafy!  I love this strain!  Tons of crystals on it. Leaves you with tons of hash on the bottom of your grinder.  This says it leaves you hungry.  It made me less hungry! Also many people hear sounds really good.  It's kinda trippy visually also! You may think you see something. Also puts you in a good relaxed state of mind.  As far as yield. It's a great plant and you...”"
fatstue,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1417497,"“Tried this before it was on leafly because it sounded trippy and it gave me a lot more. Beautiful smell and taste. A musky, earthy taste with a great full body high. Great for pain relief and sleep. Had minor surgery and smoked it for pain relief, instead of the pharma shite they gave me and it was great. Nice full bodied indica like barneys farm is known for, def grow again”"
Chillvill,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1505924,"“I gave it a shot growing this interesting strain, and I must say there was zero dissapoinment. the beautiful purple that came during the flowering phase, slowly spread across the leaves, but not the nugs was amazing. the Orange hairs that came with only gave me an idea of the relaxing effects to come.
when I was done curing it the smell was so unique I can't even describe it other than it was an earthy smell that stu...”"
Budnight,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1439811,"“Smells wonderful, earthy, spicy, buds are sugar coated. Takes 8 weeks of flower to be ready.
Taste, here's much better than smells, tastes like spiced blueberry with hint of cinnamon.
Strange as not many reviews, but the way plant was crossed, wow! Requires deffo more attention. Strong enough to put asleep with fancy visualisation, something to do with ayahuasca. Not recommended for newbies. The only thing i would di...”"
wmommy22,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1624227,"“I love trying different strains. I deal with a lot of neuropathy pain, and this little flower does wonderful for me. It hits me fast and puts me in a very relaxed mood. I usually have 2 bowls full to really try and take the pain away, but I don't even finish one bowl with this strain. And the taste is smooth,no coughing”"
Gordov,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1481941,"“Exotic plant,good resina,original herbal mix aroma and taste. Also easy to grow.
Very good for good night sleep or taking a knap.”"
ezjay,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1417680,"“I got this strain today and it was a very nice Purple color. It had very tight Nug's and a strong Spice smell to it.  The buzz was relaxing and a medium type body buzz. To a novice it might be too much for the day time use. But to an experienced smoker it would be great any time of day. Overall I would rate this strain at 80/100”"

justaguy71,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1670541,"“Dear god this is good pot!! After one big puff (with my normal medical tolerance) I'm already floating away on a puffy cloud. Zero anxiety, and I get it really bad with the wrong strain.

With the next few hits pain and muscle cramps melt away. I'm left with pleasant thoughts, relaxed, and tingling from head to toe.  Time to go lay down in the bed and drift to sleep.  Very strong, but not in a racy way. Super "stoned...”"
Nicolopez881234,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1650928,"“this is by far my favorite strain, gives you a very good body high and you'll feel relax, good for night time, but is also good to use it in a park and just chill feeling the sun and the wind, it is strong so if you are a new smoker y recommend smoking with other people who can control your trip to experience the best out of this stain”"
Polecatt613,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1609441,"“Great dank kushy/purple smell and taste, buzz is heavy indica with just enough sativa to make things... well,not boring. Always seems to be a soild choice in my books.”"

Btothob,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1602394,"“Awesome strain. Heavy smoke with a great relaxing euphoric body buzz.

Very relaxing and one of my favorite strains.”"

Wolfbutt,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1685290,"“I am a practicing shaman so researching the spiritual opportunities of cannabis is high on my list of goals. While I have never taken ayahuasca and don’t plan to, I have researched its role, it’s effects and subjective experiences. Reviews left me in some doubt as to whether it would live up to its nam, so I tried other trippy strains first, getting attuned to the visuals and figuring out what effects let in the spir...”"

I'm a regular smoker and find that a lot of indicas don't make me to sleepy, but this was some seriously drowsy and dopey stuff. Great late night strain.”"

ebc56423,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1599095,"“This strain is wonderful, out of all the strains I've grown this is in my top 5! For me it grew more like a sativa by stretching. Buds were not very dense but the yield was still great.
The effect was more indica however it was not overly sleepy and barely any couch lock. Super potent though!
The buds themselves weren't purple but the sugar leaves were almost black and they made deep purple rosin. 
The taste was real...”"
jJoePah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ayahuasca-purple/reviews/1422288,"“This is a visually stunning and unusual plant. It has almost purple leaves and attractive, extremely frosty flowers. It has a very distinctive, almost hypnotic, yet slightly sour smell. It is quite an impressive, if not large plant.

However, the flowers are also very leafy, meaning the buds end up loose and overall not very potent; this leafy quality also affects flavor, making the taste a little paper-y, and it als...”"
