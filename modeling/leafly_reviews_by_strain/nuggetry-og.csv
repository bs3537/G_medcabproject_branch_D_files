Does anyone really know the difference between Nuggetry OG and any other Indica out there?  Does Chubbs have access to a special seed?  Just a random thought after trying some Nuggetry OG.  Mason, Peace!”"

Great store, people who work there are really good and professional.  The only down side is the bud.  It is just flat out not good any more.  I wont begin to guess as to why.  Who ever knows?  But this was great medicine that became mediocre at very best.”"

Last 2 trips it was mediocre at best, bordering on bad.  Too bad, another example of a dispensary not being concerned with quality and wanting just to make money.  Never going back, too much great quality here in LA and especially SF valley.”"
