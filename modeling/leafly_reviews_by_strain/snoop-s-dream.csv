I always look for the "wearing off sleepy's," and this strain does not have them at all.  When the effects start to wear off, you are still awake and alert.  Great for a daytime stress relief, and focus, also if you have a weak appetite, this will boost it up for sure.  When Vaporized the flavor is EXCELLENT, the fruity, sweet flavor is that type of taste ...”"

This is one of the best strains.  It is amazing.  Nice thick head high, but no couch  lock.  Makes sex out.of.this.world.  Kills appetite (you will not eat).  Makes orgasms last 5-8x longer.
