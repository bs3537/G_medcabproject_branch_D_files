missleander,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/double-dream/reviews/1412309,"“I'm one of those sensitive type who gets paranoia easily from weed. But with this strain, very very little and really worth it. My tmj and neck problems and the pinched nerve in my shoulder was nonexistent. Completely numbed out but not numb to where you feel like you're going to be paralyzed. Comforting high. Kind of spacey but able to focus and complete tasks.”"
Sublime1993,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/double-dream/reviews/1413325,"“A cerebral, mellow, with enough focus/alertness to function high. Your body will relax a lot more later on in the high. May cause a little drowsiness at the end of the high, but it won't put you to sleep.  Did cause a tiny bit of paranoia, but nothing strong enough to kill your high. I see this as a day or evening time strain. 
Medical use from Double Dream would be a great quick stress and pain reliever strain. Have...”"

I wouldn't take it before bed, not because you can't sleep on it but because why waste a day high like this? This is 100% pure Fuego in my opinion. It's so choice, if you have th...”"

My family grows mostly diesels here in Oregon but I have been searching for a local strain for my migraines. Double Dream is by far my FAVORITE strain yet. I have come to realize I prefer Sativas over Indicas for my migraine relief. DD relieved the nausea immediately and the full affects kicked in slowly over a period of 15 minutes. I smoked in the morning...”"

I'm really glad I ended up grabbing some of this.  The buds small in size are heavily trichomed and smell of a mixture of sweet citrus and blueberry.  The effects are very nicely balanced, but sativa dominant.  I blazed this after work late Sunday night and made it through West World and The Walking Dead, wide-awake enjoying every moment.  After, I was able to trans...”"

santosizer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/double-dream/reviews/1417230,"“What a unique strain. It smells like herbs, forrest like, lemon/citrus, and blueberry/rasberry for the sweetness. Inhales smooth like water, exhales like a freezer, ridiculously smooth. The high is alert, not paranoid. All your anxiety melts away. Towards the end of the high you get that indica side subtly coming on. Very sessionable strain. I will keep this as a day time strain though.”"

niteowlnick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/double-dream/reviews/1390176,"“A great strain if you're looking for creative and mental stimulation, the intensely sativa-based effects of Double Dream are quick to onset and provide an energizing and euphoric cerebral buzz at first, before eventually tapering off into the relaxing and soothing effects of its indica side. Great for relief from stress, anxiety, insomnia, and depression.”"
