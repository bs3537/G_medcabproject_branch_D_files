As Hash Plant worked her magic, I found myself relaxed, happy and ready for bed. Insomnia has been my nemesis for years. I was able to sleep through the night without sleeping pills! Love, love, love Hash Plant!”"

My ole' lady was nagging me to do the dishes, which I hate doing, and I hate being nagged. I smoked BC Hash Plant and was completely content while doing the dishes and getting nagged, lol - within minutes.  All my days' stress was gone. I would not recommend this strain if you need a lot of mental clarity....this is probably one of the most "narcotic" ...”"

Here's the insight I can give on the Hash Plant I grew. It is most definitely sedative, however not to the point of total couch lock. If anything it is a very balanced body high. Where the punch really comes in is with the headie effects. You receive a very pleasant cerebral buzz that doe...”"

The gentlemen at the shop was very friendly and knowledgeable and recommended the hashplant. He said its only good hashplant if it smells like this. Smells like earth and of black licorice, a very earthy taste that comes with an intense body and head stone that with heavier doses will certainly result in an incredible sleep and ease of any pains. Thanks Green Society.”"
nuglugger,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hash-plant/reviews/1394275,"“This strain makes me want to take off all my clothes!  Eat something delicious.

Tierramama,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hash-plant/reviews/1378835,"“I am dealing with the painful inflammation process from rheumatoid arthritis, so I look for spicy, earthy strains that are heavy on the caryophyllene and myrcene terpenes to control the inflammation and pain. This bud filled the need very well. It put out at least 3 bags of vapor. The spicy terpenes tend to make me sneeze, and this gave me several good sneezes.”"
justbaked42o,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hash-plant/reviews/1374561,"“The taste is super distinct, actually hash-like. It burns so well too. The high is hazey and just chills you right out. I remember smoking a bunch at my school in the winter and it really helps warm your body up compared to other strains. Try lemon hashplant as well, its the same type of high but with a lemon smell and taste as you would imagine.”"

I found it really nice for controlling migraines, but I wished it had more of a head high and less of a body high. I felt really clumsy and dizzy, but I was very mentally clear about it. Definitely a good high if you don't have to go anywhere though! Nice to watch movies & fall asleep to. Definitely helps me feel relaxed & sleepy.”"
