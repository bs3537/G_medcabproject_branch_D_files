RoBSkEE,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1414912,"“I'm A Heavy Indica Smoker, This Strain Looked, Smelled, Smoked & Tasted Like Straight Sweet Blueberries!!! The High Was Great!! Relaxed, Had The Munchies, Ate & Watched The Game. Definitely A Must Have!!! Awesome Strain!!!”"
Dstern1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1414913,"“Wow. This is strong medicine. Almost a narcotic like pain-killing effect, but without the nasty side effects of taking pills. 

Great flavor, and scent. Burns evenly and smooth.

Don't make plans for after you smoke this strain, unless your plans are to take a nap.”"
Cannibis707,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1382022,"“I'm not gonna lie I bought this just because it had a cool name but as soon as I hit the blunt I started coughing. It took around 5 minutes to hit but when it did OMG I was Stoned. my whole body was numb, I lost my vision for a minute, and I really felt like a zombie. If you're trying to have a good time at a football game this is the perfect weed.”"
Deitab,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1374574,"“Once again Godberry doesn't disappoint.  Has to be my all time favorite for relaxing, and releasing all the day's stress.  Not a strain I would use unless I were at home and able to relax.”"

Deitab,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1062395,"“MAN I LOVE GODBERRY!  This is my second time medicating with it, and it's just soooo awesome.  Great pain reliever and insomnia cure.  If you need to sleep and kill pain, you have to try this one.  You won't be disappointed!!!”"
flygirrl75,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1382047,"“At first I was skeptical about this strain because the description made it seem like it would render a person useless and bound to the couch all day. When, in fact, my experience was the opposite. I vaped it instead of smoking and found this strain to be exactly what I was looking for. It completely killed the pain of my muscle spasms but didn't make me feel high or "stupid" like I expected. It turned out to be great...”"
Deitab,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1324439,"“Godberry does not dissapoint!  My husband and I smoked this about an hour before bed and it hit both of us like a freight train!  Nice, relaxing, and we got the giggles once we were in bed.  Nice intake, great taste, got mine from GTA in Phoenix.  LOVE IT!”"

Budp,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1349616,"“Real new to using marijuana as medication. I can tell you this much, things have changed since the 80's. Now as a PTSD patient, who has not had a real nights sleep in 9 years, this stuff is awesome. Even the reoccurring dreams and nightmares are not as bad. It's nice to sleep, without some VA prescribed addictive medication.”"
darkdweller,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1301014,"“Godberry is incredible for pain and sleep. I felt no pain whatsoever about twenty minutes after smoking. I then went to bed where I was more comfortable than I have been in years and drifted peacefully into sleep. Wonderful stuff.

The taste is unique, very fruity. Overall, recommended highly for those suffering from chronic pain and insomnia.”"
IandI,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1346193,"“One of the best Indicas around for sleep. Hit it at 3 am with lots of insomnia and was out like a light in just 15 to 20 minutes. Didn't experience any munchies, but then I was asleep before they would have kicked in. Slept a hard 8 hours and awoke up refreshed and with no brain fog, which is a hazard with some indicas for me. Prefer this over Purple Urkle, Northern Lights, Gods Gift and a tie with 24K.”"

DJintheMHC,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1332471,"“A remarkably potent strain that tastes phenomenal.

Taking more than 1 hit of Godberry is a surefire way to wind up horizontal. 1 hit, in itself, will have you thanking the stars that you have Netflix and a cellphone to order pizza.

Perfect for a long night at home, either crushing a TV marathon or catching some elusive Zs.”"

weedolympian,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1414971,"“Has a good taste vaporizing, in a bong, pipe, or rolled.  My lips went numb when I used the vape, which only happens with potent herbs.  Definitely would use it for medicine making (ie tincturing, oil infusions, salves, etc...) for pain related issues.  Definitely helped alleviate pain symptoms for me & it has a pretty good longevity to it.

The Indica gives you a very nice numbness & overall body experience.  This s...”"

The smell is really fruity just delicious.”"

Like after a few good hits off this pen and I can go straight to sleep. Very useful for medical patients, not surprising since this is a top quality cannabis brand”"
HollyFuFu2001,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1659512,"“Lovely, strong and clean indica strain with a delicious flavour. I found personally straight after smoking I felt a nice head high that creeps it’s way down to a potent body high giving a floating and tingly effect. Great for appetite, sleeping and pain relief. As most people say this strain is completely body numbing”"

mackelprangb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1230087,"“Maybe it was the cure, but seriously to me, this is the Bazooka gum of flower. It smells amazing, tastes fantastic and looks even better! But the high is over so fast! Just didn't last for me.. Idk. Maybe I'll try again from different grower. Not impressed far though.”"
CaseyJ0nes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1290653,"“Love this strain, one of my favorites. Nice sweet berry smell and taste, smooth smoke and powerful nun in body high. Lovely before bed or chillin on the couch for the afternoon.”"
VanIslandCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1311099,"“One thing I noticed right away with Godberry is the skunk/pine aroma, which I found interesting given it does have blueberry genetics. Nice purple bud, rough smoke (super heavy) and very sedating.”"

GoodVibes33,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1226715,"“Mmm...one of my favorite Indicas no doubt. I had some of this, grown in a greenhouse outside. Absolutely beautiful and I can almost say it's one of those 1 hitter quitter type of strain. Super relaxed, in a euphoric state of la la land bliss. A very nice change from an OG. In the top part of my favorites list. Find this if you can!”"

GreenVW,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1246017,"“If you can't find Fire OG this is a decent substitute.  I don't love it, but it works if you need a day time strain...however...this is far more relaxing than Fire OG.  With this I kind of just want to sit around and read or watch TV, whereas with Fire OG I want to clean my house, do the dishes, do laundry, workout, and then relax.”"
Babymegsy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1200041,"“One of my favorite strains for the end of my day wind down. I suffer from restless sleep and it's also great if I need to take a puff and go back to bed. I use a water pipe and it tastes awesome. One of my top 5.”"

I lean more towards sativa because I like to keep busy, but I'm trying more indicas due to paranoia and anxiety that comes with sativas. This godberry had me motivated, very talkative at first, getting things done, it gave me a surge of energy, then I relaxed and had an AWESOME nights sleep. I liked it”"

mistergreenfeet,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1219099,"“Label from my dispensary says this one is a hybrid, but it's listed here as Indica. Not sure what's going on there. The taste is very fruity and floral, quite nice actually. Effects are good, strong body and psychological effects, don't need to smoke a lot. I just took one hit and was ready to put it down, which is very good in my book. Tastes great, smokes great, hits hard. Go Godberry.”"
lady_ampersand,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1677962,"“I tried out this strain as my caregiver recommended. Oh. My. God. First, it burned so smoothly. I barely coughed at all, than again I'm used to concentrates and I smoked this in flower form. Second, it smelled AMAZING and tasted even better! I tasted straight berry in the back of my mouth for two hours!! You do get serious cotton mouth though. Have a drink on hand! Third, don't plan on getting anything done with this...”"
sursumdeorsum,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godberry/reviews/1062390,"“This strain has received very positive reviews but it is indeed not a very potent bud. You must consume a lot of this fluffy bud in order to feel the full effects but even at peak level it will not be intense. I do not recommend it, especially for the higher price it is usually set at.”"
