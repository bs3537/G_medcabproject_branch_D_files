This strain is just perfect for me: Great morning and daytime smoke, will leave me motivated and energetic. Also, my mood swings completely dissappeared leaving me happy and focussed, and this strain helped me a lot to get off high doses of effexor (killed the withdrawal symptoms).

A must have in my med cab...”"

Our weed is much lower in THC than in the USA, but this strain blew me away.

Matd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pure-power-plant/reviews/1382605,"“Very good one, some THC in it (hum that's good), feel's good on it, been smokin that for 1 week now. Smooth for the throat PPP is good for moderate to heavy user.”"
PatnaisBeef,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pure-power-plant/reviews/1390652,"“In my opinion it's an excellent strain. I smoke 2-3 a week and I'm usually a night smoker. Even if this one is known as a day weed, I found that it's amazing after a long day of studying or working. It's uplifting, but smoke a little bit more and you become a couch potato which can be nice. 
Not the best, but it's really good.
