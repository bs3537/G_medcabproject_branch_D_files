It seems to be a perfect hybrid. Normally I like heavy couch lock indicas but I am enjoying it's upbeat yet sedative effect. Nausea, stomach issues have been eased away by this comforting strain. Good for outdoors as well.”"

Mik-e-leptic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-ak/reviews/1480676,"“Potent but up lifting body buzz, same goes for head. Instant feeling followed by a back up "creeper wave" that can be fairly lethargic in heavy doses. Though it's an excellent on-the-go day time strain.”"

It has quickly become one of my favorites because of its ability to get me zooted every time. I use it at the beach and at night for a chill time. I highly recommend this strain to anybody who loves a good couch lock and some Netflix with snacks.”"

pudhaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-ak/reviews/1345117,"“This is my first time smoking weed, so my review might be a little off. This hybrid is relatively sedative, smoked about 0.4 gram and fell asleep about 40 mins after smoking it. Woke up feeling nauseous and groggy for the first 3 -5 hrs, drastically improve my sleep quality though. 

All in all, a good sleeping aid!”"

Epsilon58567,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-ak/reviews/1683347,"“By far my favorite stain. Keeps you at a nice couchlock for a few hours. Def gets you that "I'm floating" vibe. Really wish it was more popular bc i miss it.”"
sburke30,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-ak/reviews/1679159,"“Very versatile strain. Well balanced. Can easily be used for an energetic day time high, or as a relaxing nightcap. If you smoke enough, you might get a little couch lock. Had me laughing quite a bit, just put me in an overall happy mood.”"
Yent,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-ak/reviews/1472806,"“I love this strain, first I ever had and I still do it now. The taste is great, the smell is nice (although when trying to hide it from roommates it is a bit of a strong smell.) The high for me isn’t always amazing but the dreams I get from it is like heaven.”"
