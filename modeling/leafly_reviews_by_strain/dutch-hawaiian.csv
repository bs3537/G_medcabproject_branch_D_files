Best bud of the new season for me.”"

The smell is exactly like fresh mangos. Potent sweet tropical fruit with pine when smoked. Smooth through the inhale and exhale and a good cough after a breath of air. Nice happy euphoric relaxed uplifted focused. Doesn't give me anxiety for being a sativa. I will try again, and recommend for beginners. Dutch Hawaiian is like a...”"

Soon I was more talkative and my stresses were melting away. Finding myself in unfamiliar environs would normally be a stressor, but I was, however, chillaxin.”"

koomiekoomy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dutch-hawaiian/reviews/1193072,"“It smells and tastes good; however it doesn't even come close to any of the stronger sativa that have won the Cannabis Cup.  I give it thumbs up for smell and taste but thumbs down for not striking the right chord . If you are looking for top quality sativa, don't waste your time with it.  However if you are considering a light-sativa, closer to hybrid, with good flavor then you should sample it. (Paxed it)”"

Uplifts you without feeling too high. Mentally gives you a boost of clear energy & happiness at the same time. Found this perfect for doing yoga to upbeat music. Easy to forget that you are high, because it feels like you had a solid cup of coffee instead of smoking weed.”"
