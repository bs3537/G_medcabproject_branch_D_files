Harlequin GDP
=============
ghostwood,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1501020,"“My tolerance is maybe kinda low so take my judgement with a grain of salt, but if you're anything like me, this strain will kick your ass. Don't discount it because of its low percentages. 

I was recommended it because my dispensary was out of the Cannatonic I was hoping to get, which I use to manage my severe chronic pain. This variant had much less CBD (like 6:5 CBD:THC compared to 2:1 that I'm used to), but I sai...”"

Eases muscle/fascia tension and joint pain. Relaxing but not couch-locking. Great for pain relief while maintaining concentration and focus.”"
Squanchie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1624367,"“Very relaxing. almost immediately takes away anxiety/Upset stomach. The GDP gives a soft heady feeling that leaves you relaxed and calm for hours but still able to pay attention to a movie or TV show.”"
Koopday,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1539729,"“A fan of most CBD strains because of severe cramps along w back spasms (meds r always drowsy) and they all seem to work but PurpHarlequin is a top 2/3 easily in the CBD strain category.  Nice ratio; one I had was about1:3 cbd:thc, both %'s in low/mid teens!  Very great for a relaxing and awake buzz and a very effective pain reliever!  Looks nothing like other CBD strains I've seen due to it's brighter color and densi...”"
Redno,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1692290,"“I smoked this to help with my PTSD. I LOVE it. It's a low THC strand so I could sit and enjoy it for a while without getting fucked up. But once it hits you it will surprise you. It's a great high. I was laying in bed just feeling great. Good body buzz, positive and relaxed mindset and NO anxiety. Anxiety is a an ongoing challenge for me so I'm picky with my strands because some make me anxious. I'd use this one as m...”"
karlwireless,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1472532,"“Good stuff. I like Harlequin so thought I’d try this. Smooth to Vape and calming. Definitely some headiness to it but nothing strong. Feel cool inside from it. Tastes better than regular Harlequin too.”"
daChark,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1547918,"“This is strictly a medical strain. You won’t get a traditional high and won’t have psychoactive effects due to the high CBD. However does calm my nerves after a stressful day and helps create a relaxing feeling. Slightly uplifting.”"
rollinstoned25,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1574879,"“it was my first cbd strain, good taste and good smell. I did not get any paranoid feeling from it. it was a good calming relaxing feeling. I would definitely get it again”"
leaflyweedmaps,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1504640,"“Great strain, nice mix, great for the day, a sweet buzz that wouldn’t overpower. Smoke, then head for  the great outdoors.”"
freeasabird8317,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1659247,"“I personally did NOT like this strain. that doesn't mean it's a bad strain, just not for me. grand daddy purple came on within the first minute of me smoking and that was amazingly awesome, but then the sativa came on and woah woah woah. I wanted to hit the breaks so hard. very anxious, racing thoughts. I already deal with that on the regular so this strain was the wrong choice. I sat there and waited to be sober. I ...”"
Otownsmoke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1669433,"“Good clean high, not too strong not too weak .. like another reviewer stated this isn't the get you stuck cant do anything high but it is still very powerful & pleasing !”"
deanrayzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1676066,"“This strain is great! It's the only strain I've found that completely relieves my Crohn's symptoms, and it wipes out my anxiety. I  almost didn't get it, but I'm glad I did. This strain is a godsend, I'll be medicating with it from now on!”"
scottj73,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1742612,"“i tried regular harlequin when I was in Colorado , and loved it great for stress anxiety  and not to much head buzz, so I figured id give the ole hag a chance I was kind of reluctant because of the grand daddy purp, so I got some flower at truelieve and I will say wow one of my favorite strains so far better then the plain harl. a couple of of small hits in a little bowl and im feeling great anxiety gone almost immed...”"
TacoWifey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1730444,"“The description on here can be deceiving. I have a higher tolerance for CBD since I’ve been medicating in last few months. I got dispensary grade GDP/Harlequin. It was a tad high $45 an 8th for CBD flowers but heard incredible reviews for it. The smell is sweet grapes GDP with grass earthy/musky from CBD Harlequin. Lots of red hairs. Compact dense nugs. Decent amount of sugar! Darker buds. Like most Indicas and CBD, ...”"
Francostudio17,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1747441,"“Good strain relaxing a minor headache mean your smoking to much for effect in my opinion happy feeling anxiety with even a car alarm or something that can cause my ptsd to react to different situations was not in temper or any kind of paranoia very relaxed and focused but relaxed focus!”"
Mananaberry,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1757752,"“Amazing bud! Great for pain and anxiety... absolutely love this strain and it is a game changer for me. High is smooth, relaxing, and very chill. One of my favs!”"
becjenn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1798561,"“I'm not sure if it was the cure or what, but I HATED the taste of this strain alone. It had a very skunky flavor (almost what I imagine cat pee would be like). In the bag it smelled more like fresh grass with a bit of a tea smell, but in my vaporizer...blech! When mixed I don't notice it as much.

For the medicinal effects, it was good at taking the pain away without couchlock. I was able to focus and stay on task bu...”"
benethopper,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1797400,"“One of my first flower purchases after medical approval here in Florida and consumed via glass pipe. Fantastic hints of grape and Earth. I often mixed it with heady sativa's like Sour Diesel, Jack Herer and Colombian Gold for an added kick of motivation in the morning without anxiety. Medicated in the evenings, mostly, to clear my head and lock me into my bed for the evening. I have definitely noticed a change in sle...”"
Suziesilverado,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/harlequin-gdp/reviews/1744403,"“It makes a nice hybrid 1:1 tincture.  Relaxing but also leaves you with some energy.  Unfortunately, it also gave me a massive headache the two times I tried it. 
Hopefully, Trulieve will bring back the remedy/9 lb. hammer tincture combination which leaves me totally stress free with no headaches.”"
