CaliBot,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi-gold/reviews/1772051,"“Known for it's huge buds and psychedelic trip, this pure sativa landrace as delicious as I find it, is not a strain you choose for taste. A true example of weed with no sedative properties. Like most African sativas it is a strain perfect for focus and productivity if consumed with restraint. All fans of the cannabinoid THCV look no further. Users prone to paranoia beware.”"
