jlc08,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kobain-kush/reviews/1324422,"“I give this strain a strong 3 (so like a 3.8). For me, the effects were very soothing and relaxing and I was able to ease in to a nice sleep. However, this plant doesnt have the best taste or nose to it. If you are looking for an enjoyable smoke, I would suggest finding a different Kush. But if you are looking for a prototypical indica effect, you'll find it here.”"

I have constant chronic pain and can't sleep well. This strain helps me get some sleep and eases the pain for a while. Gives me an appetite too. Overall a really good strain.”"
