Scratchy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blueberry-kush/reviews/1417799,"“Great strain, forced me to say "holy shit" as I exhaled my first hit. Gave me wicked munchies [but I made an amazing grilled cheese:

The green, dense buds have tendril-like leaves that give it the impression of being on fire.

I don't understand how such a flavor could grow out of the earth without being an actual blueberry... This strain is awesome.

Starts off with awesome relaxation and a grin across the face. The nerve pain in my lower leg went away, the muscles relaxed, and the stress melted away. Also felt a bit aroused 20 minutes into it. It's the sort of strain you can relax on or still get stuff done on. I vaped 1/2 a gram 30 minutes ago and still managed to write up this review.”"
