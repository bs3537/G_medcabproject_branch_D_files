Looks: Quick review here.Been getting alot of purps recently. These were round popcorn buds with a deep purple colrating and cheesey yellow hairs. reminded me of a purple-indica dominant blu dream.
Smell/Taste: A pungent sour grape aroma dominates leaving little hint of "blue", but the taste is led by a musty creamy earthy "blue"/grape flavor on exhale.Very nice, usually dont such a differnce from smell...”"

I would recommend this strain for anyone who wants to have a sense of control yet experience relaxed body sensations. Please don't pass this one by. Best by vapor.”"

Especially nice after work.  Its like a little vacation every time.  It doesn't come around much in this town, but when it does, I never fail to procure purple dream.  It is one of the first indica dominant strains I've tried and one of the best.  Its not a complete knockout which is nice ...”"

Quick satifying, yet not too harsh of a high. perfect for on the go. I do suffer from anxiety alot and this seems to help super well.

I had to try it based on that, and I am impressed. Apparently (according to the description here) it is part purple kush rather than GDP, but it doesn't matter. I really like this strain. It is mellow/calming, but doesn't stop me from functioning...pretty much exactly what I was hoping for. One of my new favorites...”"

It is as if Blue Dream and the sweetest purps in the valley got together for dinner one night, and made some poor decisions that led to the rapid maturity that comes with adolescent parenthood. They then took that little bundle of joy and taught it everything they knew about unconditional love and caring for their fellow citizens. 

This is Purple Dream; see her, favor her, get to know her.”"

It does spark some creativity but it makes you too lethargic to do anything about it. P.D. also made my depression worse, I did not feel uplifted at all.  No wonder this bud was discounted.”"
