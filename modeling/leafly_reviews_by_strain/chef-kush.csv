Chef Kush
=============
ZesterTester,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chef-kush/reviews/1602914,"“Probably some of the tastiest and most powerful kush lines I have ever sampled. Truly unique. 
Quite an unusual set of flavors and smells.
Skunk, Wood, Cheese funk and rotten blueberries.
Was very nice smoke, Very strong yet smooth.”"
