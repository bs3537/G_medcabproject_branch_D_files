OCWeedReview,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-diesel/reviews/1413638,"“After reviewing four straight indicas, I've lately felt run down and tired.  I have always preferred uplifting sativas, the type that set you going and give you the feeling like you can take on the world.  OCPC has grabbed a winner with their Strawberry Diesel.  Although there is some Afghani indica tucked into the NYC Diesel, overall, this was the euphoric sativa for which I was looking.  

The buds of this strain a...”"

I was looking for a strain to help combat depression, anxiety, and really bad thoughts I am suffering from. I suffered from being mundane, lost touch with things that used to make me happy like music, art, reading, working out, etc.

That being said; STRAWBERRY DIESEL IS A WONDERFUL, HAPPY, EUPHORIC, CONTROL THE DEPRESSION, SPECIAL STRAIN.

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-diesel/reviews/1359544,"“Strawberry Diesel is an incredible high, an awesome medicine, and definitely one of the best strains I've tried. It did cause SEVERE dry eyes, Ben Stein style, so make sure you have eye drops handy! Other than that, I had a great case of the giggles, made me very happy. I slept like a rock after, too. This strain is great.. Right up there with Chernobyl, Girlscout Cookie, and Dead Dawg.”"

I don't know who the breeder was of the strain that I received in clone form and grew myself, but it's definitely "diesely" with a berry, or fruity overtone. It's a bit harsh, and will get coughin' if you're not careful, but it's stoney and relaxing effect is fairly long la...”"

In fact, I've been working exclusively on 1/8 I bought recently, and I'd say that this strain has been triggering neurosis in me consistently.

If I stay positive, it helps me figure things out. But if I get negative, and dwell on my fears, it also helps me figure those things out - in a bad way - by opening...”"
ayylmao503,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-diesel/reviews/1372540,"“This strain is good for beginners, as it gives a balanced high and doesn't induce very much paranoia. On the other hand if you are an experienced smoker looking to get some good stuff, you might not be super impressed with the overall high, or at least I wasn't. But overall not that bad, but not super great.”"
batenswitch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-diesel/reviews/1134088,"“Amazing fruity and pine fragrance/taste. Happiest high I've ever had, this stuff just makes you feel universally content. Smoked two bowls--the effects lasted around 1.5-2 hours and after they wore off I felt pretty tired. Overall this is great stuff, I'd imagine it'd be perfect just to smoke while hanging out with friends, makes you happy, giggly, and sociable.”"

Grows many branches (outward if topped) with heavy, super super dense buds that smell piney/earthy with strawberry notes definitely in there, especially when grown well. Because buds are sooo dense, mold/spider mites tend to love it also (go figure). 
Very strong initial high that doesn't last too long but can be used for pain relief fairly quick.  The high is certainly "heavy" and can prod...”"

There was undoubtedly a bout of drowsiness associated but not so powerful as to curb my insomnia.

Pretty mello high. Very Sativa like by really only giving a buzz from the shoulders up. A very fun smoke for day time. It's a good smoke, just one you'd have to keep up a system to smoke all day. Zero sleepiness and no munchies. However it is a very short lived smoke. The high last barely an hour it seemed. Pretty mello”"
weedology,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-diesel/reviews/1365906,"“The smell of this strain is similar to pink lemonade which makes this strain very intriguing. The high is not too strong with a nice cerebral high and light body high. When medicating to this strain I noticed slight paranoia but it only lasted about 2 minutes and after wards music and stand up comedy could not have sounded any better. I would recommend this strain for time that needs to be given to yourself.”"

Very enjoyable stuff!”"

The dense buds were medium to dark green with light brown hairs & fine clear crystals. Effects made me happy, uplifted, & relaxed. THC level was 17%. Because this is a Hybrid when i smoked a little less then normal it's good for it's daytime Sativa effects. But, when i smoked more then normal it's good for it's nighttime Indica effects.”"

It's an OK buzz, a little too mellow for daily use for me. If I didn't already take some Hulk-strength sleeping pills I would try it for insomnia.

I might try it for a nap or something, hanging out, watching movies, that kind of bake. Very relaxing, but I don't feel productive at all.”"

jaxanthony23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-diesel/reviews/1296129,"“Delicious diesel taste and pungy smell. Hits quickly and slowly hugs your body and makes you feel relaxed and free of headaches. Better for personal out door use. It hit my buddy later on. The effects kick in slowly but they linger throughout the session if you smoke in good scenery. It allows a trippy euphoric feeling along with a giddy and relaxed feeling. Great for night time and day time use.”"

Nice, relaxed, euphoric high. A mellow mix of head and body. Nothing too intense but nothing bad as well. Definitely a strain to wind down after work without putting you to sleep. Video games are enjoyable with chill music. Playing Borderlands 2 listening to Drake. Munchies are minimal considering I'm stoned. Not a strai...”"

My friend stole some from his moms cabinet ( it was grown properly ) . We ditched school that day and we smoked the pretty flower .. It gave me a very euphoric and happy high I am 18 now with a medical marihuana prescription and I am looking for this strain but
 no where to be found in the Bay Area region .. ):”"
