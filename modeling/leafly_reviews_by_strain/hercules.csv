MoonstoneConnection,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hercules/reviews/1357206,"“A lovely hybrid. While I think ol Herc likely grew this for Chronos to help with his arthritis pain. Is it from Olympus? maybe... Its a very tasty, terpin heavy draw that culminates in a smooth mellow ,forget your dilemas type buzz. I would highly reccommend for anxiety during the day or ADD supression. Good indica traits without going to bed.”"

WolfcolaVP,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hercules/reviews/1392338,"“Heavy head buzz but not sedating. Tastes great and smells even better.”"
Willowmomma7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hercules/reviews/1466909,"“Holy shit balls... this hits heavy! I'm a pretty regular user and this strain gets me in the ultimate feel good high. Go easy if you are a novice. Or don't and enjoy a happy night in!”"
charlemagne,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hercules/reviews/1299359,"“I acquired a quarter/lb called Hercules Mystery Machine about 3-4 months ago, and incredibly, found 1 seed in the entire package, which i planted, and harvested only 2 days ago. Because it's in the early stages of drying/curing, i have yet to compare the high to that of the parent plant. However, given the healthy growth of the plant, and it's exceptional appearance, i have "high" hopes i've found a strain which grow...”"

Let me tell you this strain smells bomb,looks bomb but yes indeed it does keep me relaxed, good body high, and I’m calm and keeps my blood pressure at healthy levels so and can go about m...”"

bishikawa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hercules/reviews/1687624,"“Got 6 seeds. 5 were male plants. The 6th died in infancy.”"
along27,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hercules/reviews/1619869,"“I smoke daily, mainly sticking to heavy indica but picked up a pre-roll of this.  Hit harder than anything I’ve smoked before leaving me in an anxiety riddled ball.  Definitely a heavy hitter that for me promotes uneasiness and anxiety.”"
MagicalHerb420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hercules/reviews/1695690,"“It's relaxing to where you can sit down and chill but also like you don't get locked in place at any moment you'd be up to go take a walk or play sports. The smell and light green color adds to this being a personal favorite strain as well.”"
