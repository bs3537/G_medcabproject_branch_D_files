TriPak,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-biscotti/reviews/1614042,"“bruh this is the overall best strain most say this is a indica but that's not til it sitting in and relaxing you. Starts off like a pure sativa and goes into indica .. This wayyyyyy better then Gelato could ever be 💯🔥💯🔥 If you see this you got to try it best A1 Gas I've had number 1 favorite”"
PURPpplEATER,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-biscotti/reviews/1615022,"“Just bought a gram of this to try for 420 after being recommended by staff at Green Planet in King City,OR. 

Holy crap am I glad I picked this up. The smell is wonderful, fruity, and very fresh. 

The draw is very interesting. It feels like it's going to make you cough your brains out, but then you never actually do. It's a smooth draw the entire time until the very last puff of the bowl. It's fascinating but awesom...”"

You'll feel relaxed yet motivated to move around. One of my favorite strains of 2018. Can be found available (mostly) at Attis Trading Company in Oregon.”"
rainingforest,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-biscotti/reviews/1669129,"“This is the first strain I have loved since the first inhale. I am not used to sativas, so this one kind of surprised me. After I took a hit of wax, I felt an instant head high. I just felt "good." I will also note that this strain actually tastes sour/sweet and tends to induce coughing. Anyway, was I surprised. Five minutes later, I felt something building up. Then I was hit by a massive body high that caused my ent...”"

Wonderful for anxiety and relaxation. Sets in with the sativa side quickly and strongly but not overbearing after two pulls. Laughs and giggles with a spacey yet subtle haze. Then the indica side comes in. It helps you get back into a set phase of “I can smoke more” or “I can just chill”. After a thir...”"

JoshTwitches,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-biscotti/reviews/1636186,"“The tangie smell comes through like crazy! It smokes well and tastes like a tangie cookie. The effects are very behind the eyes feeling but I also felt a rush of pain relief as well. I feel light and floaty with zero ankle pain. 🔥😁”"

The strong taste sweet lemon kicks in right away. Before I smoked sour and then switch over to this and man to can tell what a difference Tangie biscotti is 💯💯💯”"

Ive had many different strains and this is one of my favorites for sure. Smokes great and taste even better. Starts off as a stavia high and goes right into straight relaxation. Love it. Its a must try if you ever come across it.”"

greensabbath,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-biscotti/reviews/1647743,"“Wow! This strain is one of the best I've ever had. Super stoney with a soaring sativa rush that settles into a nice indica mellowness. This one clocks in at 31% THC....absolute fire!”"
chuckdatruck,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangie-biscotti/reviews/1802462,"“Holy moly, my nose was immediately filled with a strong aroma of citrus and that “funk” associated with more pungent strains. Beautiful, dense nugs with a dark green color and short amber hairs. The taste is unlike anything I have had before. It is sweet and pungent on the inhale, with a citrusy taste that reminds me of oranges on the exhale. The high is sort of cerebral; yet my body feels very relaxed as well. To me...”"
