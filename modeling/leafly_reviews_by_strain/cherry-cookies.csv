Cherry Cookies

UncleAcid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cookies/reviews/1396499,"“Was VERY interested in trying this strain, because I kind of have a thing for cherries. I will (shamelessly I might add) get baked and munch on nothing but straight up maraschino cherries. Yeah. I'm that guy. 

So this strain has an AMAZING smell. Unmistakably cherry, with some earthy/woody undertone. It was the first bud to impress me that much on smell alone in quite a while. Very unique.

As far as taste goes, I r...”"
SilverBubble,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cookies/reviews/1506120,"“I've tried more than a few strains but this one and Chocolope both delivered euphoria unlike any others. Now that I've tried them, I'm not sure I've ever experienced euphoria with cannabis before. Also the anti-depressive mental shift is significant and endures.”"
MrDerman007,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cookies/reviews/1395316,"“The Cherry Cookies Shatter concentrate by FireLine is packed with a cherry flavor and aroma, and when exhaled from your nose it leaves a wonderful cherry "after-smell" that is quite sweet and fruity. The high increased my mood and gave me nice body buzz while avoiding a foggy mind. After just a few dabs of this, I would go ahead and put this in my top 10 strains.”"
Everybody420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cookies/reviews/1494057,"“This is a wonderful strain for all my weed enthusiasts who love a good tasting bud with a great high. I mean damnnn the taste is very unique and sweet. Very relaxing and mellow high. I love this strain. Instantly made my Top 5 & Must Try lists... 


Enjoy my fellow smokers!”"
iamveryratchet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cookies/reviews/1414755,"“Buds are very attractive in color and smells earthy with a nice sweet flavor.

Amazing experience! This hybrid starts off pretty mellow and uplifting but as the high gets stronger it randomly fluctuated between the body to head high ratios and it was always unpredictable and if you can focus enough you will get really excited to see what it will throw at you next. Also a very long lasting high that gives off great eu...”"
WisconsinCheeseHead,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cookies/reviews/1414693,"“Tightly packed nugs with flavorful smell that jumps into your nose quickly. Upon burning this strain you get a quick frontal lobe high. Smoked 2 small bowls got up and went to bed to think for a few hours. This strain will leave you alone, sitting in a catatonic state, with a very clear mind. For those of you that feel the need to move, be prepared for an olympic weightlifters challenge as this strain left me trying ...”"

It felt great. From the 1st hit I felt it immediately. Very potent and it definitely put me in a euphoric state. Super happy with it and I would recommend it to anyone!”"

euphoricvoyage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-cookies/reviews/1487649,"“The buds that grew from this plant were incredibly fluffy, soft and what I like to refer to as The Kind - a rare, dank sticky strain that’s hard to come by. The Cherry Pie is most evident here, in taste and smell AND effect. It is overwhelmingly sweet, pungent and sharp - You gets hints of the Durban parent too. I react so strongly it smells, i know immediately whether I will like a strain based on its smell. And thi...”"
