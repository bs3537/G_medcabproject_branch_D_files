Mostly a head high accompanied by equally potent - if not stronger - euphoria. The high really isn’t so much heavy, but is so gone that it’s a real challenge to function or accomplish anything.

Anyway meet him at bar and we went outside for a joint. I was really impressed, this stuff really f*cked me up, gave me a super high. Wasnt until i got home and sent my friend an email asking him what that weed was cause I wanted some more of it..he said it was a new strain called Royal Haze. I can...”"

Definitely dank.”"

ozjthomas,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/royal-haze/reviews/1181947,"“A very nice hybrid sativa strain with very prominent haze characteristics. Very good for pain and depression and nausea. Not too strong, which can be good as there is little paranoia, but some dry mouth.”"

Osko,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/royal-haze/reviews/1342595,"“Amazing strain, makes you enjoy every moment and experience,it's a great strain for doing chores around the house. Might make you a little bit tired after but nothing much”"
Barronvongrateful420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/royal-haze/reviews/1198350,"“Not quite sure why this strain isnt rating high in medicinal qualities with a CBD rating as such ? THC does not hold but three medicinal qualities on the wheel. I understand our obsession with THC. I like it too. My point is shopping  for a high THC content strain is like flying a red flag that you shop recreationally :)”"

smowkey,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/royal-haze/reviews/1454642,"“All round strong. Picked up some royal haze wich had good looking texture. Imo it has a cheese-like taste to it wich i think is real nice. Smoked it as wake and bake and had a good strong high for couple of hours. Even at work i was able to work fast and concentrated. Will absolutely pick up some more royal haze in the futur”"
PurpleGoddess313,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/royal-haze/reviews/1415720,"“I'm really just not a fan of the flavor. The high is okay. It's a blowed but still good to highly function.”"
