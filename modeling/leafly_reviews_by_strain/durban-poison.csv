Durban Poison
=============
MrTibet,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/durban-poison/reviews/1417851,"‚ÄúDurban Poison is like the "espresso" of cannabis. The raciest sativa I know of, it's a stimulating and clearheaded high with no trace of numbing or "stoning." It wakes you up, cuts through the bleary fog and leaves you clearheaded and bright, gives you energy to go and seize the day. Gives tons of energy and also an intense emotional euphoria... where everything is vibrating and you can't take the smile off your face...‚Äù"

It is a pure, full-tilt sativa with all of the lovelies that come with that designation. If you're feeling stressed, anxious or depressed, this will kick you right out of it. If you're prone to extreme anxiety, use caution and start small. Sometimes this strain can make anxiety worse if you smoke too much.‚Äù"

Liking DP even more after having gone through more of it. The first couple times I smoked DP I got paranoid, hence the previous negative reviews. 

However, I've found after a few times the paranoia goes away and in its place now is this clear-minded focused energy without feeling stoned dumb at all. This is some highly functional shyte if you can get through the initial paranoia.‚Äù"

SixthMayor,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/durban-poison/reviews/1132387,"‚ÄúMy first smoke ever. Would not recommend for a first timer.
Took a fairly big hit from a bong. Started coughing and almost felt a bit like puking. Then when I got high I couldn't really tell if I was enjoying it or if it was pure hell. I remember thinking that if this is how it is to get high, I don't understand why anyone would want that! I became very paranoid and felt extremely dizzy when being still. As soon as I...‚Äù"

gangagal,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/durban-poison/reviews/1413802,"‚ÄúI had high hopes for this strain and was very disappointed. 

Durban looked great, smoked smooth but it's "creeper" effect left me anxiously freaking out over nothing. I drove around looking for something to do/distract myself but everything seemed intense and stressful. The high lasted incredibly longer than what I'm used to. 

I didn't think it was possible for me to dislike a sativa but, it's possible because I di...‚Äù"
GreenPie,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/durban-poison/reviews/1370568,"‚ÄúMeh! Gave me paranoia and too much energy considering I didn't want to do anything because everything made me anxious. Overthought EVERYTHING. Then forgot it all. 

Still it did work like a charm on a headache from spring allergies. I can see how this strain would be good for head issues so long as the individual doesn't get anxious from this strain like myself. But even so, it wasn't that potent for body pain. Consi...‚Äù"
wrekless,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/durban-poison/reviews/1370600,"‚ÄúThis strain is said to give you an energetic and clear high. I smoked some and my high was anxious, nervous, and very disorienting.  I felt like I was time traveling and I could feel time ripple through my body.

I was looking for a clear, fun high but I was trapped in a very uncomfortable time-loop. 
I finally figured out how to force time to move forward...

So I think I'm qualified to give a review. I'm a Sativa or Sativa hybrid person. I use it for pain, appetite, mood elevator.  Cresco Labs had alot of hopes.  But, not from me.
