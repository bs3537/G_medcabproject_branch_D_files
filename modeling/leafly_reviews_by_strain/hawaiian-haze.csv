Hawaiian Haze
=============
vangink,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-haze/reviews/1385219,"“Received a half zip of this along with some Tahoe OG. The comparison is mind blowing; opening the Tahoe, and then the Hawaiian Haze. The HH is unbelievably light, could only fit 6g into my 1/4oz jar (which normally fits 8-9g comfortably). Appearance is exactly like that of the picture, an earthy mellow green with spaced out long curly light hairs. The smell is what instantly hits you as you open the jar. It's like a ...”"

Also, you don't need to smoke a lot to get high. I bought a quarter and normally that would last me a day, but I only had half a gram of it and I was flying. I highly recommend this strain to anyone with anxiety, depression, or insomnia. I have those things and Bipolar Disorder, and this strain really helped me out.”"

voice918,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-haze/reviews/1374414,"“It's mostly great for energizing sativa lovers like me, but it's heavier stoniness can sneak up on ya.

If you're trying to get stuff done, smoke half as much as you'd expect to and wait a while. 
Cuz it's gon' creep. 

Great psychoactive creativity that flirts with paranoia and anxiety in larger amounts. 

You have been warned.”"

I first smoked it with a very good friend of mine and we both have anxious personality with scatter brain (ADD). Cannot tell you how easy it became to finish school work. Also, after smoking in the mornings and finishing up my day, I go to bed and wake up and felt like one of those pansy princesses in a fairy tale.

Really good day time strain, I think this would be really good as a wake & bake for a lazy day. Advised for users that are quite experienced, as the high could be too overwhelming for newbies”"

I dont feel too stoned but it is yet good enough to put you into sleep mode if you smoked a whole joint to yourself lol just let it creep up on you.

However, it gave me a headache that lasts for about 10-15 minutes after smoking, which kinda killed the buzz, but the rest of the buzz was quite nice. It's a very warm, happy, uplifting high. My body felt as if it was floating. It helped with my pain a little bit, but I'd probably mix it with a low THC/high CBD strain if I really needed a pick-me-up painkiller.
