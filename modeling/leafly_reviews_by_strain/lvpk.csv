LVPK

Hash Zeppelin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lvpk/reviews/1414028,"“Smoke Report

Intrto- LVPK is the best overall strain I have smoked to date, for one major reason. I am a daily smoker and one of the most important qualities for a strain to have is potency over time and quantity. I gain a high tolerance to the majority of strains I smoke after about a quarter ounce, so any strain I can smoke an ounce of and it still gets me baked really stands out. I have smoked lvpk now for the ...”"

Not for the lightweight or the careless but most smokers will love it. Its the kind of weed that makes the whole routine better , the look, the smell, the feel as your are breaking it up and that first blast from the bong. The batch I g...”"

Perfect indica/sativa blend.  Potent full body high that eases into a long lasting euphoric sativa experience.  Absolutely wonderful.”"

spitlord,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lvpk/reviews/1254725,"“It did the job.  Nothing overwhelming,  some purple here and there,  so it looks nice.  Mellow,  heady high.  I bought it in a pinch because I was broke, otherwise would choose something else.”"
emola,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lvpk/reviews/1260410,"“Tases as good as it looks.  Energetic heady high at first then settles into a full body stone.  Amazing... under an LED light it looks covered with sugar.”"

tirnanignog71,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lvpk/reviews/1260409,"“Tied for first place all time favorite (ATF).  There is nothing bad about this strain.  Sativa like euphoria that settles into a full body stone.  This is top shelf.”"
DamienDarke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lvpk/reviews/1387313,"“This stuff is incredible.  I've been smoking for over 10 years, and this shit knocked me on my ass.  After that, I was wanting to do all kinds of crazy shit. I haven't felt like that since I was a newbie stoner.  This stuff is definately NOT FOR NEWBIES!!!  You will definately do something stupid, and get arrested.  Use cautiously.”"
citywildcat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lvpk/reviews/1530409,"“Initially a pleasant buzz and rather euphoric/ still able to focus and get things done.  However as time wears on I experienced a severe headache.  Tried it again with the same results.  A lot of dizziness too.  Not sleepy.  Prefer El Chapo OG.”"
drewfus420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lvpk/reviews/1193492,"“Awesome hybrid, true best of both worlds. Sativa and Indica playing very nicely together. Works great for a wake and bake or a late night treat. Great colors, dense buds that seem to expand when ground, gets stronger over times as it cures. 
Great smell and taste, thick expansive hits from my bong bring little coughing, but it does give me pretty good dries, especially the morning after. Relaxing, pain relieving, no ...”"
mistergreenfeet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lvpk/reviews/1222042,"“STRONG. I smoke this stuff and pretty much expect to take a nap shortly afterwords if I'm not doing something already. Great for insomnia. Fair amount of paranoia from time to time smoking it. Great fruity sweet scent.”"
