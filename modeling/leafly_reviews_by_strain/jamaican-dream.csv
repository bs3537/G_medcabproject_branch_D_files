Jamaican Dream

SpeedyOnion,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1410624,"“I usually prefer Indica strains, but as this is a Sativa dominant, I'm going to give it a 5/5 because it's great for what it is. Felt this in my head mostly. Not a great strain for getting that really relaxed, sleepy high, obviously. But it is light and happy. The smell is amazing. Smoky, with what seems like a hint of spice. It's unlike anything I've ever tasted before.”"
Grunt0311,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1375657,"“Quick onset high. Makes for a great wake and bake for weekends. After vaporizing an oven full, I get relief from stress and day to day PTSD for about 3-4 hours. I also was very productive and focused. Great daytime strain.”"
nwsmoker,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1375658,"“I usually don't medicate with Sativas, but I have found anything crossed with bluedream is amazing. I picked up a solid eighth nug today and have rosined half of it. It's extremely uplifting with soothing pain relief non-drowsy. Leaves an amazing taste in your mouth and the exhale is exhilarating. I wouldn't definitely recommend this for daytime pain relief and anti-depressant. As always, the strain just has to be gi...”"
DaBinx,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1415218,"“This strain is very effective for how fast it flowers and being a strong sativa. Tastes mild, sweet, and unique. High is clear and creative. Does not blow your mind like 10 to 12 week sativas but no anxiety yet still upbeat. I would rate this strain less on flavor and effect but the fast flowering and high yield make it very desirable.”"
eddiev9914,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1415219,"“The taste was unreal, you can really take a hit and close your eyes and imagine you being on an island. I smoke this before working out and studying. Only down side is a slight headache after. But nothing another bowl can't fix.”"

Treat of a strain taste like a Jamaican Jerk Buffalo Hot wing spicy,fruity and woody.
Indica dominant 70/30 feel's like.Great night time strain.

durban32,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1742107,"“This strain has soft lemon-skunky smell. After vaporizing I was waiting a few minutes for first waves of high. In first 30minutes was jamaican dream pretty energetic, up-high and with psychedelic touches. After it was effect more calming but still active. At the end was lightly physical but not quity sleepy.

I found this strain more suitable for comunication and socializing than Durban poison. Definitely day time st...”"
ArtZee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1208879,"“Jamaican Dream was a great choice all around, absolutely beautiful flowers visually with a great tropical smell and flavor. JDR flowers gave me an uplifted, relaxed head buzz that was fairly long lasting,4.8 out of 5.”"
bestmeds,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1372821,"“Jamaican Dream is probably the very best wake and bake strain i have ever tried. The taste is earthy pine, and the buzz is 100% sativa. Not the strongest meds in the world, but it suits me fine for mornings especially. This bud makes me get up and go, and is very social while providing stress relief. You may get the giggles with this strain. very easy on your lungs if combusted. I like the taste also.”"
Samsonsimpson1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1363843,"“Love this strain, it's very relaxing, fun to smoke during the day and very uplifting. I can stay active on this strain all day and not get too tired.”"
Tastesogood,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1363845,"“Works so good with depression. This will sneak up on you. It has very good taste. Not recommended for anxiety later in the day. Use a sativa instead. This will slowly help your depression, but in a month you'll feel really good.”"

hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1573781,"“This is one of the most enjoyable highs that I've had in quite a while. In a word the best way to describe the experience is "effortless".  It is an incredibly clear and joyful time. There may be a touch of paranoia, but not much. This is one of the most singular marijuana encounters for me. It must be enjoyed to fully realize the power of the flower.”"

smoketron714,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1341950,"“Smells great! Has that strong sativa smell with a hint of blue dream taste when u first hit it. Not a great flavor when you exhale though. But definately a strong sativa. Gives a medium to strong head high that I can feel down to my shoulders! First time trying this one. Might be one of my favorites!”"
camelanddana,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1343969,"“Tried it out. Perfect for a person who is naturally hyper and likes to smoke but doesn't want to be lazy. Not a very heavy buzz. Nice”"

azviejo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1341952,"“This is the first time I've tried this strain and it does just what it says, picks you up when you're down. Started doing jobs I had been putting off for awhile and felt good while doing them. The buds I got from the dispensary were fresh top quality so I am sure that helped to give this one its full potential. Recommend this one when the crap of everyday life puts you in a deep hole.”"

IandI,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1272821,"“Good strain. Very similar to Tangie for me, which is one of my favorites. While a sativa, it does leave me mellow and sleepy towards the end of the high, so it's also good night time staple. No paranoia, and no munches which is big one for me. Not as energetic as the description might have you believe, in my experience. Bought at Yavapai Dispensary in Cottonwood, AZ.”"
NappyAir,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1296492,"“Very relaxed vibe with woody earthy tastes that are wholesome and filling. I don't feel buzzed per se, but deep relaxation without losing your mental edge can be enjoyed. My anxiety went down but I did not feel impaired. Good earthy scent, sticky as hell and a smooth drawl. I used a dry flower ghost Vape alert at the lowest setting.”"

I did, with none of the calming effects. I now smoke only Blue Dream, ALSO a hybrid, but just has a totally different effect on me. Jamaican Dream stank, too. Blech.”"

newbylala,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-dream/reviews/1240019,"“Provided me with almost immediate relief from head pressure and light sensitivity! Awesome strain. Lots of energy, not a munchies inducer, for me at least. Coupled with some great music and coffee (it is a little harsh on my super sensitive throat, warm beverage helps me with that), my house is looking really good. Great for mood, as well. It is worth giving it a try if you haven't already done so.”"
