BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-blossom/reviews/1411062,"“Thanks Leafly! I suggested they add this strain.

Orange Blossom by Falcanna out of north west Washington State is truly something special. With a THC level of 27% and a cannabinoid total of 33.4% it definitely caught my attention.  But holy moly! ORANGE SODA!! The aroma and flavor was without a doubt the best and most unique orange or citrus strain I've ever tried.  I can't describe it as anything but the taste you ...”"

FriendMan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-blossom/reviews/1472791,"“I signed up to leave a review for this strain. There's many strong, tasty, complex strains around now, but I really like the character of this one.

Other reviews mention an orange soda taste, which to me suggests an initial hit of strong citrus with a dewy-sweet tropical/honey undertone. Coupled with the name 'Orange Blossom', I was expecting this to be an uplifting Summery strain along the lines of Grapefruit or Le...”"
CTalexia,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-blossom/reviews/1416876,"“firstly, this flower has a warm citrus smell, like an orange peel. the smoke tastes much more subtle and smokes really smooth. I'm usually a bad cougher but I didn't have any trouble. the high was a happy dreamy lull. Super relaxed and warm. it was relaxing but not sedative. kind of a short high, but overall pleasant.”"

Sascoltch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-blossom/reviews/1614343,"“Has a nice citrus smell and taste to it. Very nice relaxed high for me. Would be disappointed if there was no orange smell/flavor to it since it has orange in the name.”"

But I'm thinking Orange Crush more than Fanta.  😂  Potato/Potahto...no matter what your orange soda preference, this strain is delicious, effervescent, and potent. I'm a fan.  Thank you, Falcanna, another wonderful smoking experience!!”"

Cheeksx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-blossom/reviews/1573439,"“The first strain I tried from Falcanana and it was delicious. Super citrusy and a subtle aftertaste, this 60/40 Indica Is still a great option for a not too heavy high and a light munchie session”"

kannamae,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-blossom/reviews/1387419,"“When I smoked this strain, I felt instant happiness and positivity. This is a great strain for depression. Absolutely no paranoia. The only negative thing I have to say about this strain is that the landing is kind of abrupt.”"
aegisart,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-blossom/reviews/1469879,"“The description is very accurate. This is a uniquely tasty strain that will leave you feeling as comfortable as possible. Great for anxiety, it is heady and friendly.”"
Jmed111,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-blossom/reviews/1784124,"“Unfortunately the quality of bud was not there with the batch I received, this meant I wasn’t able to experience the strain fully, however this is my experience of the strain. The bud appeal was low, the buds were loose and rather leafy. The smell and taste was pleasant, oranges/floral. The high lasted a long time but just felt unpleasant. I had munchies but the taste of foods didn’t seem as good as it normally would...”"
