It always makes me feel happier, more focused, more creative and uplifted. This strain gets you relaxed but energized at the same time so it's perfect for all occasions and can be smoked day or night.”"

Cured the crop for another week before sampling. Rolled a joint, took 2 hits, wife took one. Smell and taste was nothing special. As for the effect... WOW! It hits fast... took less than 5 minutes... yup, this is powerful stuff. I had a mild headache/migraine all day and that just disappeared. What is strang...”"

On an interesting note, though, I had a hard time deciding whether this was an indica or sativa dominant hybrid.  A good hit had a hint of the hashy, heavy taste of indica, but it still had the fresh, piney, fruit...”"

Atomic NL is everything NL is but with an added kick to it. Rest assured it is almost the exact same as NL. No anxiety really nor paranoia. Just upbeat clear but still buzzy type of high. More trippy than spacey. Always a good thing.

No paranoia, no feelings of doom. Makes me happy and wanting to go somewhere. Then there is a strong body buzzing, especially around the groin area and the sole of my feet (kinda weird!).

Smell:  Very sour

Taste:  Just like the smell

Lung Expansion 1-10:  3 - slight cough

Effects:  Husband and I smoked together, made us chatty and laughy.  Haven't had a chance to check the "arousal" level yet, but based on how I feel now, I suspect it will be equally as nice!”"

I always medicate on this strain when I am interested in letting go of my day to day concerns and switching to amorous interaction with my playmate. 
When medicating, I use 60% flowers and 40% keif.”"
