Medmike,https://www.leafly.com/indica/appleberry/reviews/1414232,"“Very mellow high, full on body effects and has an amazing couch lock feeling gets your appetite up and relaxes your muscles”"
MattIsTheBest,https://www.leafly.com/indica/appleberry/reviews/1469742,"“At first, I felt very relaxed and my mind and muscles were calming down. And then I just enjoyed no stress and happy mind.
 I have grown it outdoor, and it's like two meters tall.
 It has nice looking blossoms.
 Very nice berry smell.”"

Excellent if you have nothing to do for an afternoon. Bad if you promised your kids that you were going to make ice cream, so you speed smoke the blunt and figure out how to get ice cream delivered. It was a success!”"

Oddly makes me really aroused and had the best sex with this strain.
It’s calming so it didn’t get me paranoid as I expected it too and I had more control of myself.
Usually hate indica because it really does lock me to my bed but this mellows down my depression but can also manage to make me feel giggly.”"

Day was hot & grossly humid. Got some Taco Bell at night. Saw my next door neighbor smoking something good next door & asked if he had any to share, & he gave me this baby. 
Went inside to eat. Put on my fave YouTubers (FunHaus). Sat down & took a few hits.
Immediately tasted apples & berries! Shit tasted so good that I took a few big boy hits by accident lol. 
Ate all ...”"

It is very relaxing, heavy but not on the same level as a Bubba Kush or True OG. Great for relaxing on the couch and binge watching your favorite show.”"
MattiasElGrande,https://www.leafly.com/indica/appleberry/reviews/1493853,"“It gets me high in about ten minutes, and effects are like hour and half long.
 It has pretty nice sweet- berry taste and smell.
 Effects of this strain are sleepiness and relaxation, just little paranoid.
 I’d give it five stars of five.”"
