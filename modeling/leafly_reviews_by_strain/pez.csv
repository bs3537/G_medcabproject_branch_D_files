=============
madeline.swortz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1416440,"“Pez originated in Washington State on Lopez Island, commonly sought after by the most elite canna-connoisseurs. Pez is a strain developed by The University of Washington & Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, developed & grown on Lopez Island, hence the name Pez. It is a heavy indica and works well for pain relief, nausea & sleep disorders. Super sugary with excellent effects.”"
col4bin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1342036,"“I am a big fan of the Pez! Though this may not be the most potent, mostly-indica hybrid, the flavor and effect keep me coming back for more. 

Pez tastes more like fruit punch to me than Pez candy. I get pronounced maraschino cherry and pineapple with subtle coconut milk overtones on the palate. Just freakin' delicious. This is another one I would smoke or vape for flavor alone. 

Effect wise, I experience a mild cal...”"
DavM,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1416439,"“First strain I purchased when I visited CO. I wanted something for pain relief/inflammation since I had carpal tunnel in both my wrists at the time. Pez, plus a CBD lotion cured it within a week. It was pretty remarkable. 

Potency: 15.54% THC, 0.11% CBD”"
heathrenee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1374605,"“Within 5 minutes of my first puffpuff, I began to feel an overwhelming sense of relaxation and calmness. This strain most def delivered what I want out of a strong indica; anxiety relief, pain relief and help with falling and staying asleep.

If those are things you're seeking to remedy, too, I highly suggest Pez; I do not recommend this one for daytime use (or anytime you need you be active and social).”"
DarthCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1410196,"“Pez is a sweet smelling and tasting strain, named for its similar taste and smell to Pez candy. Its lineage is a cross between Afghani and Livity. Great tasting day-time indica for pain relief.”"
TheBeardedOne21,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1374603,"“This is the best strain i have ever had. I cleaned my entire house after just a few hits from a pipe. it makes you filled with energy, as long as you're standing up. It smells like PEZ candy when ground up and there is a slight PEZ taste. Very good strain. I highly recommend this for everyone.”"
Ubi2447,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1324656,"“Currently, my favorite nighttime strain. It is giggly and happy and relaxes me enough to get me ready for bed.”"
Dopesmoker93,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1608760,"“Another of my favorites! Smells amazing when broken up, has fairly dense and hairy nugs that aren’t too sticky and grind up well. Has an aroma of blueberries, sweet fruit candy, and fresh earthiness. Great body high and strong but clean mental high as well.”"

skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1317500,"“Really nice indica... relaxing, peaceful, very little psychoactivity... makes the ladyfriend and i sleepy, but then, I've only ever smoked it before bed. Reminds me of pre-98 Bubba.”"
mstea,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1209600,"“Very good pain relieving properties. Great tasting sweet and piney flavors This is a chill kind of flower, your pain will melt away, and you'll want to take a little catnap. But you'll wake up refreshed not hung over. More of a body high, then a stoned high. Actually it more of a napping 💤 high.”"

100StrainGirl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1493063,"“Amazing taste with pulls of lemon icing, sweet grass, and a pine smell. Found that this strain gave me some mental clarity (though I kept losing my train of thought) with a mild body high and some clumsiness. Fell asleep after an hour or so. A great Pacific Northwest strain! Strain 2 of 100.”"

Hexxi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pez/reviews/1187066,"“The honey taste of this strain is smooth and sweet. It's  very satisfying flavor. Even though this is an indica strain, it's effects don't couch lock you for the most part. You could smoke this to just hang out on your couch or bed and do some gaming for the evening. It's relaxing, but doesn't make you sleepy. It also piques your creativity a bit, too.”"

I sleep great and do not feel bad at all the next day.  Definitely not for daytime use unless mixed with a sativa.  I did a mix of this and Hong Kong Diesel...  totally different experience but an incredible high.  Probably one of the best in my opinion.   I'll keep tokin this...”"
