This potent strain fu**ing delivers! 
Definitely more of a evening, late night medicine.
Not one to really deliver a creative mind, more of a relaxed state.
IF you EVER get an opportunity to get ahold of authentic Blackwater, 
I truly recommend the experience! 
4.5/5”"

This bud has lots of crystals on the leaves, some purple coloration and a lot of orange hairs, which is nice to see.
The flavour I find to be sort of citrusy, sort of earthy, and quite smooth.
The effects are quick to take hold, I've had about 3 tokes from...”"

The Blackwater strain matures @ around 8 weeks give or take a few days providing there was no lock up due to environmental/nutritional instability.

No anxiety/paranoia (a must for me). Body high perfect while it lasted. Head high not strong enough to make me sleepy which is really weird for an Indica. But I may be developing a tolerance also.
