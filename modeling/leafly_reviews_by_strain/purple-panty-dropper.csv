Corina13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1392428,"“Need more! Lifted the foggy veil of heavy depression. In 1 puff noticed huge change in self. Talkative, happy, euphoric, stimulate creativity, awake feeling, ready to take on day rather than run away. Really recommend for any depression sufferer for Day Time use. My all time fave.”"

I am so fucked up right now. I have been high for like 4 hours off this strain. I hit my homemade THC cart. Rosin tech. 1 to 1 ratio. Only took 4 hit's. And I smoke all the damn time and use edibles.

So watch out this shit is strong. I can't feel my body or my face. I can see why some would have an anxiety atta...”"
EdibleEm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1329289,"“Well I picked this sexy strain up looking for something for my pain. My usual dispensary had this earthy beauty on the shelf and I couldn't resist. A very dark bud, not too tight, very 'light' fruity smell and it weighed up very nice. Honestly was chasing the Indica effects for pain but it's no lie, this one spiced up my entire evening ;) Very interesting taste and almost numbed the end of my tongue and lips a little...”"

iamkeysersose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1430559,"“The buzz on this one is pretty good. A lot stronger than most of the cannabis I have tried. It helps with my pain for sure. It did not, however, taste that sweet, like I thought it would. It actually didn't really have a flavor at all. But it does creep up on you, and one bowl will do the trick for a really good long lasting high. Give it about 30-45 mins to feel the total effects of it, which means don't smoke too m...”"
nj76,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1328438,"“Tried this last night with a friend. Not a very hard hitting high but got us both tingly in all the right places. Will be getting again for it's aphrodisiac qualities. Thank you PPD”"
Christopher420Blaze,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1432814,"“Very dank bud, fluffy, has some really dark almost purple nugs. Has a berry flavor alongside that basic earthy taste. High takes a couple minutes to hit you but once it does those panties are being dropped.”"
Urseth,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1359114,"“Good head high but makes me lose memory of what's happening”"
cmasscann,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1413233,"“I grew out two phenotypes of the PPD. One was like PEZ candy... super frosty large flowers but with only light purpling. My other phenotype was heavy on the purple but lighter on the resin production and terpene depth. Will purchase again and hunt for the fat PEZ flavored phenotype. Terps trump color all day long.”"
MaryJaneOlson,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1313913,"“Perfectly decent strain. The "high" doesn't last very long. I definitely got a little babbley on it! But food tastes well for a little while, you feel a little happy, then it's over. Not a big deal.

Must say, though: Clouds for DAYS.”"
Robot33,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1379077,"“2nd review listen if your on 
A budget $$$  it's  20 for 1/4 
Also 20 dollars for 7 grams 
Could be. 3 dollars a gram 
3 dollar tip. 3:3.3. A gram. Better than the higher priced maybe for myself. I like the Alaskan”"

Crucibella,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1378914,"“This is my absolute favorite strain. To be fair, I only started smoking in December of 2016, so I'm still a noob. Master Kush was my favorite until this came along. One day I hope to grow my own, because I never want to lose this baby. My head stays clear but calm, and my body tingles from head to toe. Panties be droppin.”"

dirtydawg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1380475,"“Wow...just wow. 
First off the buds are almost a black they are so purple.
Great for my inflammation and has a very mellow smooth buzz that just chillax's the whole body. One of my favorite's, if you see it get it won't be disappointed.”"
anchimaru,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1623588,"“It's okay... I didn't hate it. But it's not something I'd go out of my way for. Overall, it's your average high in my opinion.”"

Justin1020304,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1313363,"“Enjoy this strain a lot very Purple looking strain , tastes great smells great and high is great . Can be a little too much for novice smokers seems like a Racey high yet relaxes you very much”"
TheDarkNateReturns,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1352971,"“It has a fairly strong body high but really keyed up my paranoia and anxiety most times I smoked this.”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1490786,"“Not sure about this being an aphrodisiac more like Purple Eyelid Dropper for me. Eurphoric high that comes along with a stupefying mental fog and a good body buzz. Solid strain for just relaxing, but I wouldn't smoke this if you need to get anything done because it probably won't get done well.”"
monstapuss,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1612870,"“I’m enjoying this mixed with DreamQueen, so it’s a mixed review. But... I really enjoy! It puts me in a great mood, doesn’t “not” put me in the mood😉, and gets my ass moving! Unfortunately, doesn’t do much for my pain. It’s a great addition to any strain.”"
Heliosphan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1387657,"“Eh. Not that great. The buds look okay, but have an earthy, almost tea-like scent and taste. It takes some getting used to, and the potency is merely average. Furthermore, it wasn't an aphrodisiac for me.”"
Everybody420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1326779,"“Very dope strain, smell is crazy af. Buds are beautiful taste so good!!! Must try for those who enjoy a relaxed high!!”"

cannacentric-films,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1785600,"“This strain has done a serious number on me in the best way possible. I feel supreme relaxation throughout my body and am mellow as a cucumber. I am a huge fan of this cannabis's aroma-- it's a sour, citrus and flowery aroma that isn't too overpowering but elegantly subtle. My body feels weightless and my mind is at ease but also very inspired to come up with new ideas. It's a fairly harsh smoke but in a mildly abras...”"

Very relaxed too.”"
Kallifornia327,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1780204,"“This has a very very flavorful inhale, almost like you’re smoking something very fragrant that isn’t supposed to be smoked... and the flower itself is BEAUTIFUL with purples and greens.”"

Jimmyk164,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1339973,"“Amazing!!!! Such a heavy hitter one of my new favorite strains out there. Bud stucture is super dense and very beautiful to look at. From the first toke it hits you right in the head then quickly develops into a nice body buzz. Such a nice strain, would definitely purchase this one again and again. But the have a lot to choose from if this one is not for you.”"
ceb9523,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1346432,"“A real nice Indica. Gives the user a strong head high. I wouldn't recommend it to first time smokers who aren't use to a heavy presence in the head. Definitely help me sleep and relax.”"
Free2beme,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-panty-dropper/reviews/1314171,"“After reading about this strain, I seriously would like to try this strain. It sounds really nice. I always have stress which ends up knotting up my shoulders and all around just make me nauseous. So this strain sounds like it would do the trick. If anyone out there has tried this strain and have there opinion. Please let me know. Thank you.”"
