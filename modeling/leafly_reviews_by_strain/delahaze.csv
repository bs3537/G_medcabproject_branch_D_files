FluffyTiboHardcore,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/delahaze/reviews/1338497,"“DelaHaze came in like a truck: slowly (after 3hs/oral) and HARD.

Compared to Colombian 'Corinto' landrace buds, DelaHaze produced an intensely creative high that didn't compromise working memory (although my hippocampus was halted due to THC anyway as I can't recall much too well). 

This strain is great for sex! 
It is also excellent for feeling inspired and getting creative. I jotted down several ideas throughout ...”"

High yielding & absolutely covered with white trichs. It's borderline psychedelic - colours look bright, and you can end up with visions and otherworldly experiences if you're prone to that sort of thing. I've never found another like it.”"
