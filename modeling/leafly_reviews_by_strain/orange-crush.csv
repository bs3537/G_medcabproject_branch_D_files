Orange Crush
=============
ContinentalKush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1413676,"‚ÄúWow. This strain is crazy. It tastes of citrus very strongly and I love it.  It also smells really potent; it's almost like a dense citrus smell. The high was very exciting for my mind which made me laugh at the slightest out-of-place comments and at the same time was making my head heavy. I also note that I had the halo-head affect which is great. All in all, its a very conversational friendly high which stimulates ...‚Äù"
angryjon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398349,"‚ÄúPicked up in Seattle.  One of my favorite strains for a general feeling of calm.  Music and surroundings become more engrossing and wonderful probably for the first half hour after use.  After that for usually about the next 2 hours a calm persists, food continues to taste wonderful, and, unique to this strain for me, people all seem to be fascinatingly beautiful.  Comes down easy.‚Äù"
1stonOct1st,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398350,"‚ÄúOrange Crush from Chalice Farms THC 21.75% CBD 0.24%.  2 grams of bud came in a prepackaged  brown zip lock baggie. Aptly named, it smells like orange peel and pine with a soft, berry air lingering in the nostrils for a bit. Nice looking buds; lime and olive green and absolutely covered in orange hairs. Not very frosty but not without its sparkle either.

Yescaleaf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398352,"‚ÄúVaped this during 4th of July weekend. While out camping this strain made me embrace the outdoors and definitely made me want to dance all night to the music we had on (Bloc Party). It's not that strong but definitely is a good head high and doesn't last too long which for me is a plus.‚Äù"
deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398353,"‚Äúüçäüçã Orange Crush is a nice and mild sativa-dominant hybrid that is great for anytime use. It really smells like an orange. It's the shotgun of citrus to your nose will leave you wondering if this is laced with pure orange oil. It produces a nice head high that isn't too intense and won't bog you down. It's great for those not looking to get too stoned, but want just enough to get some work done. I personally like to...‚Äù"
Dr. Zimbardo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398351,"‚ÄúFirst time I tried it, I felt like I was sitting next to Method Man. Great social strain, makes sitting around with friends entertaining. It will make you somewhat lazy.‚Äù"
Sapphyy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398354,"‚ÄúOrange Crush is a very social strain. I picked up an eighth of it after I asked the budtender what would be best to smoke before New Years. I was directed toward this strain and not disappointed! The taste was phenomenal! Very citrusy with a bit of an earthy hint. The buds were light green, super frosty, and very fluffy covered in long light orange hairs. The high was very social, heady, and happy. Also very long las...‚Äù"
MrRoots,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398355,"‚ÄúThis strain is a must have. best taste for the citrus strains. First hit will leave your mouth watering... at least until the cotton mouth kicks in. She is a fast flower 7.5 weeks for the most flavor. super chunky and full of tricromes.‚Äù"
trist420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1306492,"‚ÄúFirst weed I've ever smoked. I was 13 and me and my two good friends went all out on our first sesh and bought six grams of it. This bud had me really high I remeber bein a youngin and just looking into the rain down the street after the sesh was over with. I felt like I was in a movie or some shit lol. Damn I miss those days . Enjoy this euphoric creative high friends !‚Äù"
kroniqtopus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1351680,"‚ÄúWow! I've been a smoker for 27 years, grew up on the Big Island of Hawaii where there was a ton of flavorful strains but this one by Cannabiotix is by far the tastiest flower I have had the pleasure of smoking. Pure citrus through and through. The high is also top notch, starting with a happy euphoria then transitioning into a very relaxed state of mind, but not couch locked. Orange Crush just jumped into my top 5, p...‚Äù"
dan.frampton,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1378885,"‚ÄúThis is a bud that reinvigorates my passion for cannabis. Its sharp distinct orange soda smell smacked me in the face. It's not just citrus-y. It's distinctly Orange Crush. A smooth smoke that tastes as good as it smells and leave you feeling energetic and happy as hell. Perhaps climbing the ladder to the #1 strain. Tonight was good!‚Äù"
kaylacelestial,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1079347,"‚ÄúGreat for listening to music and destressing.‚Äù"

FOR FLAVOR & AROMA, (ORANGE, FLORAL SSSSTRONG FRESH ORANGE ON THE NOSE) AND TRUE MIRROR IMAGE OF ITS NAME, THIS TASTE LIKE A CAN OF ORANGE CRUSH SODA, ALMOST SLIGHTLY CARBONATED (love them smoky burps).

Budsey420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1292335,"‚ÄúIm definitely not new to cannibas or the effects it has. With thus being said I dont rate strains this high very often. Orange Crush is one of those flowers that reminds me why I love cannibas to begin with. Extraordinary taste like a smooth orande soda (especially if you add ice to your piece) a exspansive but not harsh smoke and beautiful buds. I really would recommended if your looking for something new.‚Äù"

At first (even with the indoor stuff) I really couldn't detect more than a slightly sweet smell, however after keeping the indoor stuff in a small airtight container overnight it really brought out a beautiful sweet orange/grapefruit smell.

JedimasterDank,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1599396,"‚ÄúThis thing definitely tastes a little like orange soda.  Certainly a daytime strain.

Babalao,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1079359,"‚ÄúIt took me 4 different sessions to appreciate Orange Crush. Only after an Artist described OC to me as "vibrant" did i finally see the light.

The high has a vibrance, a slight brilliance to it. I did not experience any body FX except at the end of the ride. Moderately snoozy comedown. 

This medium-powered bud pairs well with a frosty Red Stripe or Presidente (Cerveza Dominicana).‚Äù"
