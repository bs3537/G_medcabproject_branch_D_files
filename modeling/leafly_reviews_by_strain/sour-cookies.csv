BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-cookies/reviews/1413978,"“This review is on Sour Cookies by Elevate. (WA)

This is by far my favorite GSC cross.  Very dense and slow burning, triangular heavily trichomed nugs.  The taste of this strain is perfect, just the right amount of sour, sweet, chocolate, diesel.  The effects are extremely balanced.  Leafly's description is fairly accurate.  I'm very relaxed , yet very alert.  I would recommend this strain to anyone who likes weed. L...”"

Kwihnai,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-cookies/reviews/1381042,"“Very heady and awesome strain to chill on. Got that dank Sour Diesel cheesy smell with a wonderful earthy smoke. Worked great to put the lady in the mood. This is a sex strain, careful nymphos!”"
Ionit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-cookies/reviews/1389678,"“Dominant diesel on the nose. Nice, light, piney taste. Light green buds dense with orange hairs, with a light powdery coating. Crystals are very noticeable in the underbelly. Great on physical aches while truly giving a cerebral massage. Mild intake for good gardening. Heavy intake for staying put.”"
TasteBudzOregon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-cookies/reviews/1415843,"“Amazing, tastes like smooth berry gas.  The combo of Sour D and Cookies give a nice head and body high with a relaxing finish.  During the winter grows this lady purples out to an almost velvet black purple.  Yum.”"

This morning I woke up with my body aching, and me feeling the need to vomit, and my stomach killing me. My first hit I felt it immediately! It did feel a bit harsh at first, but when exhaled, it feels so smooth, you'll feel so great you won't even notice it! It's great for the perfect duo. By far my favorite GSC hybrid I've had, besi...”"

I've had sour cookies by a few different growers i.e. Elevate and weed are most memorable. Tight dense sticky lime green nugs with reddish orange hairs. Yellow trich caked all over.

It gives off a sweet strong scent, that not only gives you a preview of the taste, but reassures you have a good time with it. On every inhale, the taste feigns harshness to the throat until inhaled fully.
