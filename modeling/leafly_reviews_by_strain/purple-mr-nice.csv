MrX,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-mr-nice/reviews/1415538,"“Purple Mr. Nice is a wonderful strain for medical users looking for pain relief.

Very unique effect though, it starts as a very intense cerebral and body high, then after a half hour or so you start to become overwhelmed with the body high and develop a nice heavy couch lock. Excellent for pain and nausea, as well as sleep. Doesn't seem to make me terribly sleepy, but definitely eases my entire body into a nice calmness that allows for sleep at almost any point. Overall p...”"

A wonderful cross with both parents sneaking in some of their best traits.”"

It assaults your nostrils with a very pleasant purple floral scent that is almost like lavenders combined with some dank cannbis.

It also was pretty comfortable, i sat content on this uncomfortable ass sofa for like 6 hours and played san andreas... sucked at racing so this probably isn't good for working fast.  Tasted really nice though, but made me cough on the exhale.”"

galvatronGsxR,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-mr-nice/reviews/1373416,"“prob my least favorite strain of the year and my very first rating below 4 stars. looks and smells good but that's a huge let down. I think the taste is awful and extremely harsh. I just smoked about 2.5 grams in one sitting out of a glass steam roller and glass water bong with zero effects, body or head. good thing I saved some alien og and bubba kush from last week!”"
