weazal,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1410259,"“Notice the head high first, like wearing a baseball hat. Very slow come on mentally, but once it starts, you can really feel it billowing and consuming your mental ability. It takes over your head in a really potent way - could be easy to do too much! Brain feels like it’s wrapped in a warm, family blanket. Not just suppressed, but elevates your mood and makes you feel good; both emotionally and physically. A euphori...”"

It's more of a couch lock and watch crappy movies on Netflix than a sleepy time high. Relaxing and uplifting. 4/5 would smoke again”"
JoePL420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1410261,"“one of my new favorite strains ( Denver CO ).   I am a daily ... but responsible ... smoker of highest quality herb and have been smoking for just about 20 years now and obviously, like everyone else, i grow and have a nicw personal use grow operation and grow really top quality herb...then, i came to Denver and went to a dispensary (this is only a single story of when i got myself some Training Day) and aftee talkin...”"
Hawaiiangrower808,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1210687,"“whoever says this is a sativa dominant must have the wrong one we grow training day and got it tested at it comes out at 27% THC and HITS hard if you have trouble sleeping pain this is the flower 10/10”"
BaronOfBud,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1410260,"“I don't know about the rest of you but this particular Training Day I have in my stable is a sativa dominant hybrid, very uplifting and heavy euphoria that's light on the body, limited edition release by DNA.”"
StoneyScuba,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1317810,"“Wonderful buds, smells like my favorite, LA Confidential, which it derives from. And like LAC, some super mind blowing sex, really puts my gf and I in the mood. Love the euphoric, but thick, head high, almost feels like you're in a dream.”"
jsumm002,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1324470,"“I'm high, very high this is a very strong strain.  Helps relieve with pain”"
YabberDabberDoobie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1297806,"“I got a gram of this grown by Jackpot Seaweed. Smells and tastes a lot like a spice cabinet with some muskiness. Very strong! I got very sleepy and a little dizzy after smoking a bowl, so I would definitely NOT recommend if you have stuff to do.”"
gcurrie333,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1276498,"“Standard disclaimer - Cannabis can have varying effects on different people, so YMMV.

I almost never get anxiety or negative thoughts on cannabis, in decades of experience. This strain gave me weird thoughts, free floating anxiety, mental confusion and a feeling of being uncomfortable in my own skin. Pretty unpleasant.

This was clearly at odds with the majority of reviews, so I tried it again. Twice. Same effects.

Rocker17,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1491933,"“Very distinct smell that doesn’t dissipate with time. Great for grinding; one can practically taste the potency (north of 22 here) when freshly ground. Taste is as flavorful as the scent. A must, even for lightweights. How else are you going to build a flavor Profile? Toke away, all!”"
CaliMoe5300,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1324469,"“A must try for indica lovers. Definite satisfaction, effects are felt almost instantly!!”"
bbedner,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1414332,"“I picked up an eighth of this strain from my local dispo (WA). It was grown by Liberty Reach and was 23.3%. I took a fat snap of it in the afternoon and was immediately relaxed and mellow! Training day has the ability to confine you to your couch if you're not careful. The buds were perfectly formed and crystallized and the flavor was nice and ripe! I highly recommend to any stoner looking for a strain to put them to...”"
Kjaxman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1208792,"“This was such good smoke, it's hard for sometimes to find something that works and I loved this strain”"

F1Jay,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1504034,"“I had this strain from a new medical dispensary i think it was az natural remedies 160 for a half once it was recommended to me by the tender. THIS strain is for you if you like the quick sleepy Indica effect combined with that grassy earthy lime scent and flavor. I'll give this strain another try maybe it was just this batch but it was the buds consistency that made it a 6 /10 smoke for me.”"
BronxBully225,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1271868,"“Couch lock is not the words needed to describe the high. Don't make any plans after smoking this strain lol”"
Hadoken,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1290776,"“Just tried this strain tonight for the first time, and it   does not disappoint. Calming and relaxing, the body high helps one get comfortable, while the mellowing head high relaxes one's focus and calms the mind.”"

doctordavinci,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1229552,"“so I have grown Training Day a few times and have found that there are 3 main phenotypes ... 1 is sativa dominant and the other 2 are indica

the sativa is not very heavy on the couch lock and has quite an uplifting high ... the indica dominate ones are super dank and quite dangerous as you will become a vegetable if you smoke a lot of it”"

OilsWithMarisa,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1224827,"“Yes! Like someone mentioned, it's hard to find a good strain that works and this is one is one of those highs that comes up a bit slow at first and then you realize you have the relaxation and heaviness settling in the head and body. A good one for sure and it doesn't take much so thanks for the prior reviews that helped me decide on it.”"

IKnowWeed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1248447,"“These flowers were more OG in structure (round, small) yet had the minty, sandlewood smell of Trainwreck.  Super sticky and dense - not recommended for rolling.  The effect was very balanced and relaxed.  I have only seen Liberty Reach / Jackpot grow this and it was decent for $12/gram.”"

rjweller,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1726343,"“The marriage of my two favorite strains.  The few times I've had dissociative, waking dreams, was on straight Trainwreck, so the fact that it's been hybridized is outstanding.  Recreationally, it's euphoric, creative, just pure happy.  Medicinally, it takes away pain, helps myclonic jerking and restless legs, and is a great sleep aide.”"

ThatGuyAgain06,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1355566,"“Very strong with an amazing smell.  I got this in a pre-roll which I broke down for vaping.  After a couple of pulls, it does feel like you're wearing a hat. I would buy this again but I just wish the intensity would last longer.”"

UnflushableTurd,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1779556,"“Putting your THC tolerance to the test is right.  I have smoked strains tested upwards of 40% but this I smoked at 16% and I feel much higher.”"
CinderFlame,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1701138,"“My first ever RSO. Rather appropriate name for an introduction to recreational consumption. Very nice, not much in the way of couch-lock, pairs really well with watching trippy videos on YouTube. This seems like a good "Netflix-and-chill-with-yourself" strain. Taste was similar to inhaling a campfire, a simple glass of milk was enough to wipe away any unpleasant aftertaste. Only down side is that I seemed to hit the ...”"

The only side effects I don't like is that it always makes my body twitch and sometimes gives me anxiety. Also, don't use if you are trying to go to sleep.”"

swapert905,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1311793,"“it makes my body more relaxed but keeps me more focused and I can already feel my eyes drying out but that seems to be the only negative side-effect”"
CptnHwdy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/training-day/reviews/1276845,"“Not too shabby! I have to confess I might be rating this in large part based on the taste which is awesome which I'm experiencing because # rosin which, turns out, is my new favorite thing. Anyway this is perfect for winding down after whatever kind of day. Slept like a rock at the end of two ish hours.”"

4/5⭐️👀
2/5⭐️👃🏼: Pine, Earthy
2/5⭐️🌬👅: Pungent
3/5⭐️Personal 🚀: Immediate high. Like a weighted blanket was laid on top of me. I definitely had the pressure behind my eyes that I get with some strains. My body feels relaxed but that pushing pressure behind my eyes is hard to ignore (again this doesn't happen to everyone). My mind is slowed and at ease. Left me a bit dizzy.”"
