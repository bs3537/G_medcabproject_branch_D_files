This is one of the best I have ever laid my eyes on. The terpines are monumental! It is so sweet! In combination with the lemon it taste almost like pineapple. My batch was quite heavy by any standards @ 27% active thc. This is one to keep your eye out for. For sure.

Smoke is so nice and smooth with a full body, and I love the taste too.The high isn't overpowering at all and I feel relaxed, peaceful, and can smoke it at any time of the day and be ok.

Very very good strain.”"
