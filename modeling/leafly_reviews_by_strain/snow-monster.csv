SandiSquirrel,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-monster/reviews/1416278,"“Snow Monster is amazing, very potent & now one of my favorites. For an Indica, I was able to stay active but yet was quite cerebral; it managed to take the edge off for several hours. I'm ADHD & a complex PTSD patient whose had several head injuries, it's hard to find a strain that can truly put you at ease like this one did.”"
infinidro,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-monster/reviews/1225922,"“This stuff is really good! Snow Monster = great stuff. Very uplifted. Took two hits off a small pipe while watching the sunset. Felt the effects immediately, and rode the high for hours before even coming next to leveling out. Felt a little high-energy—more cerebral and less relaxing than a lot of indicas. Very potent, though!”"
Carnage29,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-monster/reviews/1340430,"“This is by far one of my favorite Indica strains. It works amazing for the pain I have in my back due to degenerative disc disease. It also works great for my Insomnia, all I have to do is smoke an extra bowl or joint at night and I'm passed out in thirty minutes or so.”"
cretin71,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-monster/reviews/1426426,"“Smells earthy and sweet with a bit of skunk, and tastes musky and earthy with just a hint of sweetness. It's funky, but tasty all the same.

The high takes a few minutes to arrive, and like most indica-dominant hybrids, starts with a relaxing, happy head high. The body high kicks in about 15 minutes later, and it's strong, but not so strong that you're couch-locked. This is a great strain for the evening, when you wa...”"

azmiked,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-monster/reviews/1239895,"“These light green buds are nice and compact and round and dusted in white trichomes. They smell like cat piss and indeed the exhale is a little like dirty socks, but dam it's a hard hitter that's got me feelin no pain. 
Another A+ indica. Thanks TCC in Mesa!”"

bmeshadow,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-monster/reviews/1689922,"“Snow Monster is great...just make sure you have absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to go before partaking, because this was less, "Oh wow, do I feel relaxed!" and way more "Hey, my pain is gone, I feel great, I feel *sleeping*" and waking up 10 hours later. The pain lessening effects are no joke though, this made my pain a distant feeling, and had a very happy tone, but it knocked me on my ass. Going to take on nig...”"

LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-monster/reviews/1305962,"“I love this strain, if your looking for a nice Indica to relax then this is a must try. It smokes great, huge beautiful crystallized buds that just smell great! Stuff had me stupid right after the first hit 5 stars all the way! Seems to help me best with Pain, Spams, Depression & Anxiety.”"
dankshydro,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-monster/reviews/1620268,"“Maker: Driftboat
Total Cannaboids: 18.22%
Lots of terpenes in this one. The smell was overwhelmingly beautiful. The hit was smooth and the taste was delicious. Great strain for unwinding and/or for sleep aid. Highly recommended”"
JohnDope14,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-monster/reviews/1799384,"“Acquired a quart & love off the bat the intense aroma😱
Nothing but Sweet £arth & ginger-type fruit. Heavily Indica based effect and so fourth ßut, if you fuck around and mix it with strong Sativa I.e. “Green Crack” the game just changes in a more intense directions 💨🍀👍🏼”"
CutieWithaDoobie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-monster/reviews/1713026,"“I'd never tried this strain, I got as a sample (I'm a budtender) as I'm looking it up having no idea what its parents may be, I'm telling my parent how much I love the white whilst our stoner conversation (when I get off work I'm stuck in my weed zone still LOL) and what the hell do I see? The most beautiful combination of strains intertwined and mastering this beautiful flower. There wasnt a huge aroma before flame ...”"

Pf78,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-monster/reviews/1790774,"“On the money!  Snow Monster should be called STRESS MELTER.  This is an Indica honey for any time of day.  Turn your frown upside down!  Felt pain and stress begin to melt away on my first exhale.  Mind, body and soul was happy, talkative, focused, giggly and productive.
Next time I find it I’ll stock up.
Absolutely fabulous!!
