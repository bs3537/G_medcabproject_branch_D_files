artemisarthur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bugatti-og/reviews/1413548,"“If I didn't know better, the word "Bugatti" would be italian(-ish) for "switch that shuts off giving a fu**". You can't live a rich life and worry... You also can't get any kind of inner peace with your mind running in circles. 

Don't be fooled by her dankness;  Bugatti holds sweet mysteries beneath her dense, dusty exterior. And she's so nice, she turns the volume of that inner voice low enough so you can hear what...”"
Jules1111,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bugatti-og/reviews/1414263,"“I am a high tolerance flower smoker & It takes something special to get my attention and then provoke a review. Bugatti has done just that. Creative is its first charm. My mind burst in to activity one bowl in. Energy was an unexpected side affect followed by deep bliss and a good appetite. This one's for everyone!!
**WARNING, lingering euphoria and chatty attitude last. Hence this review PEACE”"
CannaJedi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bugatti-og/reviews/1397143,"“Absolutely stunning. Wasn't sure what I expected, but it wasn't this. Great pain relief, melted away my stress and gave me a feeling of calm-something I have trouble with normally. Didn't mess with my head too much as I was able to focus and cook and clean. That said, this isn't a daytime strain, and is great after a long day when you might have a couple small chore to knock out but are having trouble with the motiva...”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bugatti-og/reviews/1563143,"“OK I'm going to try really really hard to finish my review rather than get started then get so toasted I can't finish.
This is an unbelievable indica dominant hybrid that I read was Bubba Kush & Ghost OG. Either way it's a long lasting medication with medium to high sedation. 
I always try to keep @ least 3 strains in my medicine cabinet one of each; indica, sativa, and hybrid. This one is my hybrid but I've been usi...”"

stonerchica,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bugatti-og/reviews/1479532,"“This strain SLAYS pain. If you want the best of the best, look here. The name actually suits it really well as it smokes and feels like the most luxurious strain one could hope to find. The cerebral effects are as comforting as the body effects. My anxiety disappears and my body floats blissfully when I partake of Bugatti. Did I mention it's long lasting? Like I'll smoke, go to sleep, wake 3 hours later and still fee...”"

Cisco2454,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bugatti-og/reviews/1568129,"“Dont smoke this before you go to work if you work a job that requires hard labor. Smoke after you get out and you'll be good, real good. This shit gets you high, relieves pain, and all in all is a strain worth getting, regardless of your preference of India or Sativa. Make an exception for this strain, its exceptional.”"

BillT420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bugatti-og/reviews/1535548,"“If you're looking for a strain to bring you back to when you had no tolerance this is it. I have it in shatter and I dab daily. This is the strongest strain I've ever used. I've smoked for 20 yrs and all I can say is wow. Completely knocked me on my ass and then the waves started coming intense be aware. It did make me a little paranoid.”"

 but overall it was bomb”"
Jules1111,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bugatti-og/reviews/1331402,"“Not for the faint of heart!! This strain has just surpassed all of my favorites. Bugatti not only does its job at pain relief, it also gives a strong euphoric blast that stays with you. A little goes a long way, making it affordable. I'm finding it in $10 grams. Stunning relief.

I was stressed somewhat. But not anymore. Buds look familiar to a real smoker but the scent is distinct. Do not approach with caution. For true smokers..”"
althealater,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bugatti-og/reviews/1766380,"“Started a bowl about 2 hours before work...big mistake! It took me 20 minutes to realize i had stopped smoking the first bowl i loaded. Only took about 3 hits.

It's got that "back of the eyes" feeling about it. That pressure, you know? Also, i wouldn't call it "couch lock," but there is a pretty significant body high. I feel a bit "looser" - my little aches and pains don't seem to register right now.

I don't often ...”"
