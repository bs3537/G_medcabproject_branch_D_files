garyinco,https://www.leafly.com/indica/honey-boo-boo/reviews/1388911,"“Heavy producer. Some serious stretch for an Indica (under LEDs). But has dwarfed my three other strains. 2 weeks from finishing. I'd do it again immediately due to the high output.”"

therealest215,https://www.leafly.com/indica/honey-boo-boo/reviews/1324595,"“Sweet and sticky. 

Look - great look with hints of purple. 
Smell - smells like a fruit roll up wrapper. 
Smoke - the sweetness helps with some of the burn. A pretty easy smoke. 
Affect - good social high, funny, light, up beat.

AMD_Photography,https://www.leafly.com/indica/honey-boo-boo/reviews/1760372,"“Coated in trichomes, HoneyBooBoo is one of my favorite indica dominant strains.  The profile I gathered from this strain was a very sweet aroma with a hint of banana( coming from the HoneyBanana).. If you have the chance to sample this strain, I would highly recommend it.”"
Torilovexx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/honey-boo-boo/reviews/1788494,"“If I take too much it is easy for me to get paranoid from this strain. But besides that a nice relax high that made me feel cozy but not sleepy. Good for middle of the day indica strain.”"
SemiSweetZeus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/honey-boo-boo/reviews/1362343,"“The honeycomb wax from Cannavative of this strain comes in at 80.9% THC and every bit of that will hit you right away. The implied honey taste doesn't come through in the flavor profile. In fact, not a lot does. But, I do like it for its potency and effect.”"
TruLove,https://www.leafly.com/indica/honey-boo-boo/reviews/1282752,"“Honey Boo Boo is one of my all time favorite strains, although it's a little harsh on the lungs, the amazing euphoria makes it soooo worth it.   My girlfriend and I smoke it at night to help with aches and pains and to sleep like a champ but not before we have some mind blowing sex.”"
