GreenThumbGreenLung,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mendo-breath/reviews/1415574,"“Top 3 of all time!! Mendo Breath (OGKB X Mendo Montage) is the love child of two serious strains. If you get a chance to run her outdoor, I highly recommend doing so.  Gorgeous bud structure, flavor and high all equate to one of the best smokes on the market today. Stress relief, anxiety alleviation and hunger will all come your way. Rest easy with mendo breath!”"
JediKnight,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mendo-breath/reviews/1415118,"“What a way to end the day. This hybrid is great noise cancellation in my opinion, forces you to chill out. 100% not a run around flower, unless you're weird like me and can do either or. Pain relief is actually there as well. Kudos to the crafty blokes who thought this one up. 👍🏼✌🏼️”"
deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mendo-breath/reviews/1414901,"“🤢🌏 Mendo Breath smells like sweet pine-cone flavored cookies covered in Thanksgiving gravy. Pungent and stinky, this sticky hybrid feels more like an indica and definitely will relax you. Mind and body will both greatly benefit from the wonderful effects of this strain. I wouldn't recommend it in the morning, or you will be yawning all day. b-Caryophyllene: 4.27 mg/g, Limonene 4.013 mg/g, b-Myrcene 2.08 mg/g.”"

It also allowed me to sleep more regularly and without nightmares. I have PTSD and tend to have flash backs/nightmares when I'm under a lot of stress/pressure, and this really leveled my emotions out. :) I would buy again.”"
NorCalChick,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mendo-breath/reviews/1415119,"“This is hands down the best overall "high" I have felt in a long while.  I usually partake in mostly Saliva strains, as I have issues with mental illness including depression.  Man, the next day I went back for some Mondo Breath, SOLD OUT. OMG...noooooo.  I don't know if this was a one time (or four:)  crop or what.  PERFECT effects in regards to my various ailments.  But it may have been my closest tie to dry mouth ...”"

These buds are so potent it reminds me of dabbing with the flow of anxiety after a huge ripe. No type of flower makes me feel like I just took a dab. Definitely one hit wonder. I called my dispensary the next day to see if they still had this strain. They were all out. I did take a toke off this before I went out to eat instead of a sativa. That wasn...”"
nickk732,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mendo-breath/reviews/1413698,"“This is an indica dominant hybrid with very relaxing and sedating effects. The taste of the strain when vaporised reminds me a lot of Cookie Fam strains, particularly Gelato. The effects are definitely more on the body side, and it helped with the back pain I am currently experiencing. 

I would definitely recommend this strain, it has a fantastic taste and smell and the high is exactly what I enjoy.”"
kooshboosh,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mendo-breath/reviews/1392445,"“I had no idea that Cannabis could be as strong as opiate pain medications until I tried Mendo Breath. Eyes and a nose are all you need to determine the potency of these flowers. The smell is ridiculously sweet and vanilla-like, much like Thin Mint GSC. I can't begin to describe how tasty these buds are. They're overpoweringly fruity and sweet, almost like buttercream, and the nice smooth smoke leaves a pleasant hint ...”"

Anyway THC content was 20.1% I’m not usually a fan of Indica’s but this one is special.

Onset is very fast, a few minutes and it hits the body and has an incredibly relaxing and euphoric feeling.

I had finished what I had on hand of Super Silver Haze (SSH).  SSH was very disappointing.  That it was a from a brand that I had never had before and from a new dispensary, I was pretty suspect.  That said, this batch of Mendo Breath is from the same brand, Korova, and it is much more amaz...”"

The smell and effects from this strain have put it on my "strain hall of fame" for sure. My local dispensary has it listed as a hybrid, I do find it a little indica dominate but not to heavy in my personal opinion.

Shifts gears on you after a couple of hours though, and is highly (no pun intended) likely to leave you snooin'. Overall it's a solid Indica strain, but nothing to really write home about honestly.”"
