Now the strain I picked up was Rocky Mountain Fire ( RMH x Fire OG ) This beauty tastes great, smokes great, and delivers! Super dope nugs, nice large chunky buds, that'll have you drooling. Find this strain you'll love it.”"

Huge buds with fiery red hairs everywhere, coated in crystals. The high came on strong and stayed for quite some time. I became one with the couch as my mind ran rampant with thoughts. Deep body high, very good for pain relief. Would take it easy if your a novice smoker and run across this strain.”"
MrJane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/rocky-mountain-high/reviews/1232634,"“Rocky Mountain was a very smooth strain all around. The buds were thick and sticky with a dark green tint. Maybe it's just me but this strain smelled like coffee...which I can get behind. Smoking Rocky Mountain High was very pleasant due to how smooth it is. The effects are very uplifting yet mellow, it allows for great concentration and social interaction. Recommended for studying! Enjoy!!!”"

I vape using a Crafty. 
I really enjoy Rocky Mountain High, it provides instant pain relief and is relaxing but you're able to keep focused. 
Good to socialise with or have a chilled day/night in.
Found it to bring on a little anxiety if had too much but it passes quickly and you go back to a nice enjoyable high.
Overall a really nice strain for any experience.”"
