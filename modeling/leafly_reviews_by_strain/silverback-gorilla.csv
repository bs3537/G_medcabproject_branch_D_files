The first time I tried this flower I had had a bad episode earlier that day. My body was wracked with pain and my muscles were so cramped that I was also having deep tissue spasms  and twitches. My pain did not completely diminish. However my pain level went from not being able to function or speak to a...”"
GirlyAsher,https://www.leafly.com/indica/silverback-gorilla/reviews/1392939,"“Silverback Gorrila is one strain the I can definitely say gets me really aroused when I smoke it. I also walked around a fair bit feeling really wise, and felt none of my usual depression or anxiety. The one thing I can say about it though, is that it made me NEED water very badly, so I would reccommend smoking this only if you have lots to drink on hand.”"

The effects of the indica and haze strangely don't overlap.  I felt the deep body pain relief as well as the dreamy head change. Usually hybrids, for me, have the effect of the dominant strain,  but Silver Back Gorilla was balanced. Great strain! Will be making the drive when I run out.”"
KannaKingdom,https://www.leafly.com/indica/silverback-gorilla/reviews/1416971,"“Incredibly powerful indica (though more technically a high indica dominant hybrid). Much like its namesake, it is too strong for its own good - which makes it exceptional. Also tough to find this in its authentic form. But when you do find it, you'll know once you wake up scratching your head! As an aside, I'm shocked at the ratings given here by users who simply don't enjoy a particular effect like sleep-inducing or...”"

Anyway, I smoked a 3/4 gram joint right down to the stinger, read a book for awhile, then turned on a movie. Damn, this is shaping up to be an amazing afternoon. Relaxed, but not sleepy. Alert, but not paranoid. Great strain for socializing in a chill environmen...”"
