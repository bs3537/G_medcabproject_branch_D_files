This batch was all CBD, completely shutting down mild to moderate pain. I have also mixed this in a 1:1 blend with Sour Diesel, which I call Double Sour. This combo is amazing and will not only knock out pain and stress, but possibly even put you right into a deep sleep in a high enough dose. 5 Stars!”"

I can smoke with another strain, or just straight up, either way is satisfying. when I bought it, it was really fresh and sticky (exactly how I love it)  I wanted to stick my head in the jar!!! this is a keeper if I can keep getting this quality”"

Frank198146,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-tsunami/reviews/1738086,"“Well, I have to be sincere : if the strain inside the package got is this, in my case was one of the worst ever bought. I don't smoke a lot so I can't tell better if a strain is good or not. I truly believe that if you smoke  everyday, body goes in addiction.  I live in Vancouver and I bought this in Robson at City cannabis.”"

egstrangehart,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-tsunami/reviews/1328584,"“I will likely never try this strain again. Ive been on the search for a strain to combat anxiety anf this one induced it. It gave me too much of a body high which caused my anxiety to sky rocket and then I had to combat that with a Xanax.”"
TyKanka,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-tsunami/reviews/1070824,"“Did not like this strain at all and see why it was on sale. The only effect i had was sleepiness and a lazy body, no fun if you actually need to get things done.  But if you just want to waist your day sleeping, then by all means smoke this.”"
JustJacks,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-tsunami/reviews/1431221,"“I wanted to try out a high CBD/ low THC strain. I hate this strain. I felt no effects after smoking over a gram. The taste to me was apple juice right before it goes bad.”"
