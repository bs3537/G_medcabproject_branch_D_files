Franksimilia,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/amnesia-haze/reviews/1417665,"“A great strain. the smell is a composition of lemons,easy smoke without any coughing. Intensive, yet mellow cerebral high, makes u smile like an happy idiot for at least two hours. Definitely a social smoke, but not as up-lifting as other haze strains, so you wont regret smoking before bedtime.”"

Initial visualization: foxtailed Sativa buds extremely light green and coated in yellowish crystals.

Smell: Citrusy, slightly creamy, Hazey, nutty. Definitely a strain that attracts Connoisseurs, Sommeliers and those with a more experienced palate for or affinity for complex Cannabis flower terpene profiles.

Taste: heavenly. You know you are sm...”"

I got a really nice flowery taste from this and it left a citrus sort of smell in my house which wasn't too pungent.
Great strain over all, would definitely recommend to any user suffering from any mental health disorder such as myself”"
