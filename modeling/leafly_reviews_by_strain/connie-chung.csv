PrincessZeldaFitzgerald,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/connie-chung/reviews/1348974,"“Beautiful, positively sparkly with trichomes! Strong fresh greens aroma with slight skunkiness. Smoke is smooth and tastes like slightly sour hay. 

This strain gives a very strong body stone. The first time I smoked it it felt like my chest was full of rocks and I was glued to the floor on my back, just relaxing. It's very nice for helping me get to sleep and stay asleep, and the anti-anxiety effect lasts long after...”"

Mottomoot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/connie-chung/reviews/1348975,"“Great for pain and insomnia management.  Growing was easy and did well outside.  Smaller yields due to plant and bud size.  However, potency of this strain far out weighs smaller yield.  Planting this pretty little thing again.👍”"
