Got it in a sugar wax form. I was on the verge of dry heaving before I heated up that nail and within seconds of inhaling a fat rip the nausea vanished!

The more Immature example had more of an antidepressant effect and more lemon flavor, it was really a happy high, more happy than most strains (this effect really stands out) with resolution and lasting relief from migraine ,nausea, nerve pain.
