Reminiscent of its True OG lineage, Ill OG is a true Indica among indicas, and can be identified by its dark green appearance and earthy/piney aroma. Ill OG is a highly recommendable strain for easing stress...”"

So, why only 4 stars & not five? One reason, cost. I can get strains that are just as good (to me) for less money. Ill OG is a top shelf flower, one just must decide if the bang is worth the buck.
