I found myself rocketing up, levelling off for a good time then gently gliding down. A really energizing strain, don't overindulge else you may spaz out. This with a morning coffee and your co-workers will either think you're a mad genius or just completely mad. More head than body effects. It will cheer you up, make you more talkative, erase ...”"
Baphometropolitan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-borealis/reviews/1390099,"“One of the heaviest strains I've tried, but with enough mood-elevation to keep you out of the swamp. 

I medicate mostly for insomnia and inflammation, and have found AB to be absolutely perfect for both. It packs a fantastic indica body high that's ideal for both serious pain and post-exercise soreness (and especially as a pre-sleep hoot).

jeffkeith,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-borealis/reviews/1371529,"“Our new fave on the Indica side! Great looking light golden buds give up to a wonderful smoking experience...to me its taste is the perfect Afghan landrace that Hindu Kush also exhibits....classic hashy sweet and earthy tastes abound. The  very best nightime med that we have ever tried. I love all the purples out there and have smoked them all and this Aurora  blows them away. Dont get me wrong...love GDP, Grape Ape,...”"

So I sat down on the couch. My mind was pretty clear, and although I felt like I had the energy to get up and move around, I didn't, I just wanted to laze. Thankfully it didn't make me paranoid like most strains. I can function pretty well, which is great for being out socially. It definitely helped my migraine t...”"
Bart8888,https://www.leafly.com/indica/aurora-borealis/reviews/1744307,"“Typical sort of Skunk Kush strain where the Afghan is quite dominant but you can also detect the Skunk 1.

Great for mid afternoon to early evening sessions when you just wanna chill out and veg. Would recommend”"
