I bought 1/2 oz. of this about 2 weeks ago, along with a tiny and highly over-rated CBD water pipe that I paid $100 for.

This strain has been my favorite high yet! While it did dry out my mouth a bit more than usual I wasn't too worried about that. It gave me a good bit of energy and is one of the first strains I have had where I felt like I could go out and about and be productive on it.
