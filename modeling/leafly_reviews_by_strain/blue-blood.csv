HerbeHeureuse,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-blood/reviews/1376880,"“Blue Blood is my very first high CBD low THC strain, and would you believe it, Blue Blood is in my top 5 strains? It takes first place in smell and taste - it truly smells like pure blueberry, more than any other "blue" strain I've tried, and I've tried many of them. For smell and taste alone I would give it full marks, but the specialness of Blue Blood doesn't stop at smell and taste.

While the THC is low (mine onl...”"

Had a nice narcotic high very sedating. I grew fat dense nugs, all ture organics not fert line. If you tried it when I cut it and then again after I cured it you would have been loving it twice! I grew it for medical purposes wish I could have made it a bush! I had to tie my nugs up it was so heavy at the end...”"

SpiritMtFarms,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-blood/reviews/1369151,"“This medicinal plant is a cross of Blueberry x OG Kush. Great nerve pain reducer for me, CBG's at work... Nugs have a blueberry undertone that comes out in the smooth exhale. Works well to relieve my leg pain and helps with sleep. Creeper stone with full effects in 10/15 minutes after ingestion.”"

SmokeyThePanda,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-blood/reviews/1277112,"“Got a nice bag of Blue Blood from a grower friend of mine. The smell of those familiar OG terps filled my nose on first contact. I love OGs. A bit of fruity undertones can be noticed once you crack the bud. Strong OG flavors on the inhale with a smooth fruity flavor on the exhale. A slight sting in the back of my throat indicating harshness, but a decent tasting bud nonetheless. Mostly body buzz which is great for ni...”"

ryndembot,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-blood/reviews/1224438,"“so this stuff can be really, really potent. a couple months ago i tried an og blue cross that sent me into absolute outerspace everytime i smoked it! ive been smoking for 7 years and nothing has ever come close to the trippy effects. this stuff should really be looked into if you can aquire the pheno with 3:2 thc.cbd ratio. I think the other cannabinoids could have be a large factor in my perceived effects. my sample...”"
Katilies127,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-blood/reviews/1222880,"“Like that it was mellow and not harsh.
