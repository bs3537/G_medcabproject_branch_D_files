crazycolton55,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-rock-candy/reviews/1385426,"“This weed was just unbelievably amazing with its very light and fluffy buds that have a similar feel to sage leaves, but when broken up is just  super shiny on the inside with crystals. When inhaled, it gives you a super delicious sweet candy flavor with an incredible sage and citrus aftertaste. The high it gives you is super creative, euphoric, and mellow. 5/5 you can't ask for better weed than this.”"

This is the #1 indica dominant hybrid. 

This might even be #1 of all

I never buy more than an 8th at a time in case I don't like the new strain I'm trying.

The buds are really pretty to look at, every time I have had this strain the buds are tightly compact with a bit of a dark green color with a sticky layer of white sugary trichomes. The flavor isn't like I remember rock candy as a kid but it definitely has a sweet taste to it through a vape. Very clean finish to the taste as well. The effects are prett...”"

The testing done on these buds had the active THC at 32%. Whether that was right or not I'll say this stuff hits hard.  The kind of bud that makes you put your joint out half way through.  With extremely strong notes of citrus on the exhale this strain will shortly have you couched locked possibly pondering the reason for your existence.  Definit...”"

IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-rock-candy/reviews/1715223,"“Unique scent, like you mixed all the fruit sodas together, dank and sticky pungent with purple leaves sticking all over to match. Carries over to the taste and smokes smooth despite the fruity sourness that makes some harsh. Really calming body stone and a general happy relaxed feeling. Not too potent but worth checking out for bag appeal alone. 4.5”"

Works better than anything I've tried so far for pain. does not give you couch rot, but I wouldn't be able to function at 100 percent. it's right in the middle.”"

I have only ever seen or gotten this strain at Kind Love in Denver, CO.  They grow the best herb in all of Colorado and the rest of the world until I'm proven otherwise- They got the real *KindBud.

See what the hype is about!!!”"

I had heard from many that it was a potent strain but was a complete let down when smoked. Perhaps it was the dispensary but flower display was poor in size and also taste.
