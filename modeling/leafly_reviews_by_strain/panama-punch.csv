FIVE STARS.. Bright tropical floral notes pack a punch, mellow, balanced, non-racy happiness ensues. Get it. Get it now.”"

This primarily sativa strain has go a lot of energy to it. In large quantities it even gets your heart beating faster. Great for the start of day. If you have anxiety problems and still want to be productive this is a great strain. I felt like I had wings on my feet for a couple hours.”"

Picked up an ERA POD of panama punch based on my budtender’s recommendation.  He was not kidding when he told me the flavor was amazing.   It’s like I inhaled a big gulp of Hawaiian Punch.   Hands down the best tasting vape I’ve had. 

Seeing I just took my first rip, I’m just feeling the effects; a warm, cheeky glow acc...”"
TokeyRobinson,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/panama-punch/reviews/1379240,"“Interesting that this is listed as a sativa and my dispensary had it marked as a hybrid... The nugs are nice and it smells like a Tazo tea. I had a nice cerebral high for a bit then a nice body high kicked in. I could feel a lot going on in my body and when I focused could feel the blood flowing through me. I would also like to mention that I had a hard time keeping a joint of this lit unless I was continually puffin...”"
Flipper666,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/panama-punch/reviews/1385549,"“One of my favorite strains. Giant nugs, super chill high. The sativa effects don't really show up as much for me. I get a really nice body high that's perfect after a long day. If you see it, cop it.”"
larspeart,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/panama-punch/reviews/1522362,"“Not the big berry flavors I was hoping for, but sweet, and smooth, for a Haze-y, sativa-dominant strain. Uplifting head buzz, and a nice case of the smiles. Not over the top, but all around good stuff.”"

I love smoking this and going outside as it is super energizing. This is a great strain for smoking and exploring with friends or solo. Pair it with some kief if you wanna get real schwifty.”"

slothymanatee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/panama-punch/reviews/1420079,"“I did not expect to like this at all, as energetic sativas usually make me incredibly anxious, but this stuff is awesome. It has a mellow energy that makes you high without feeling out of control. Went fishing and it was a great day. Would definitely have again.”"
Larquin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/panama-punch/reviews/1366184,"“This is my go to when I need a mellow lift up. The aroma of the bud is straight up candy fruit flavors, and smoked it has a nice chill spicy finish. Lower THC content means you're not balloon head and you can session this stuff all day. Clinic in Denver seems to have it all the time, get busy with it.”"
