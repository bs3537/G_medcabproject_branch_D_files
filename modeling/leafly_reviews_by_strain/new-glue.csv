Nickbayon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/new-glue/reviews/1412767,"“This strain is amazing, I am a heavy smoker and even I find myself very high with a little amount. Very potent, and comparable to the intensity of edibles if enough is smoked. Very cerebral and a strong sense of time and space distortion. I find that usually after smoking GG#5 I'm laying on the couch on my phone looking up information or documentaries. Makes you mentally alert in a way but physically truly (gorilla) ...”"

GG#5 doesn't hit you right away, but when it kicks in, it leaves me stuck wherever I may be at the time. I fell asleep on the floor because I was glued there. I didn't try and fight it and I went to sleep lol. it relaxes your whole body and gets rid of all pain that you might have. I have chronic tmj and I can't feel anything after ...”"

Dastomba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/new-glue/reviews/1388131,"“I was much happier with this strain than some who reviewed this strain.  I found this phenotype to be similar to GG#4 in its ability to give you initial energy to get stuff done.   Like it's parents it will glue you to the couch.  Unlike its parents, this one will have you growing roots out your backside into the floor.  Very heavy come down.  Great for after dinner/work strain.  Very strong medicine for pain, insomn...”"
AkaTeddd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/new-glue/reviews/1418942,"“Gorilla Glue #5 has it's own uniqueness to the strain.GG#5 hit's you hard in to 30-45 min's session after medicating and your stuck in chair in daze.
GG#4 hit's you immediately and your stuck like glue.
I would use this strain with a migraine medicate then hot bath,relax and hope for sleep and pain.Gives you time to settle before GG#5 hit's you hard like a sledgehammer.

I smoke almost everyday pretty heavily and I still find my self stuck wherever this ends up hitting me. It takes a minute to kick in but once it does it’s just good vibes from there. It relaxes you’re whole body and always brings a smile to my face.”"

Method of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer.

Pros: Good for pain relief and relaxation. Hits the body first then creeps into the mind for a uplifting, occasionally giggly feeling. Can help with sleep.

Cons: Dry mouth. Harder to find as most dispensaries carry GG4

Overall/Other: More indica than GG4, this strain hits the body more than the mind. Normal draw and exhale, has a piney ...”"
