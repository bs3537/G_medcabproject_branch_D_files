Chloe

FatAmy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1416460,"“Absolutely 5 star worth. I believe we grade too highly on Leafly but this is award winning for a reason. One pass through a grinder and Chloe could almost be mistaken for Kief! Simply incredible Battle Born strain. Enough OG to be west coast but still it's own.”"
Hendertucky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1416754,"“Excellent day time strain. I use this as a wake and bake. You can feel your mind wake up with motivation and creativity. Although it is a very uplifting strain I never received a hint of anxiety or paranoia. Balanced between cerebral and body effects.”"

Judes1967,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1416753,"“Thee best strain from Medizin! It's my go to strain at the moment. The taste is great and the high is the best kind for my conditions. I can use it for daytime use and at night. I definitely would recommend to everyone. They have them in prerolled so you can always have that option to sample.”"
JonnyHughes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1395747,"“I'm happy that I had a chance to try this strain. Can't seem to get my hands on it as of late. I heard Medizin, a local dispensary in Las Vegas, will be carrying soon. Can't wait!”"

nuckscelts,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1349998,"“On a day to day basis I have to deal with the symptoms of ptsd. I can be fine one day, and one trigger can put me into a ridiculous depression. Well that was today. My local dispensary just happened to have this in new today so I grabbed a 1/4. The entire time rolling I could not stop focusing on how depressed I felt. Less than half way through the joint I found complete peace. 10 minutes was the difference between f...”"

bigtone412,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1368922,"“great everything smoke for pain. sweet taste. even better as a wax”"
Acapulco_GoldOG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1424314,"“Very solid smoke. It is not my favorite Sativa but it is a very good strain from Medizin. The only downside is this will give you an extreme case of the munchies.”"
alexl0pez,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1329300,"“So far the best hybrid”"
jerbear88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1496911,"“Just a solid strain all the way around. The buds I got were so dense and heavy with resin I get happy just thinking about it. The high was euphoric and uplifting then melted right into a great body buzz. Chloe is my mistress now.”"
ABK702,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1419392,"“Before I really got my med card which was a couple weeks before it got legal, this strain for awhile I would stay away from mostly because how high it got me. It's been a long time since I've had that sort of feeling. I definitely recommend this strain, and a must try if you have never had the pleasure before.”"
Cblow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1556141,"“No doubt a hella great statin plus created locally- always trying to support LV’s hometown growers- see you all soon for my prescription refill!”"
ThePolishPothead,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1505523,"“This is a top shelf sativa. Super uplifting and happy feels with a lot of thinking and creativity going on. Great for smoking during the day or when trying to get something done. It’s a little pricey but if you can pick it up on a day they are doing a sale then it’s a must have.”"
nomadseanluke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1719856,"“A sativa powerhouse. This strain is a very euphoric high. It has a little bit of body but mostly mind stimulating. Maybe a little too much for a productive day but low dose would be perfect.”"
SSMAMA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1364597,"“One of my Medizine favs!”"
Jonzer2049er,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1357218,"“This strain is amazing.  I am so glad I somehow discovered Medizin.”"

DaddyZammitt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1348231,"“I'm more of a Sour Diesel fan but god was Chloe good. Nice easy body high but a lot more cerebral. Watch interstellar with this strain!”"
Nembudz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1364494,"“This is a very unique strain. I pick up from swc. Medizin is doung the right  thing. Im good with strain crossing myself.. im thinking this mystery strain is somewhere in the neighborhood of platinum og x gorilla glue #4. It deffinatly has gg qualitys to it as well as an og smell. Very good med.”"
shottyqueen420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chloe/reviews/1375218,"“Called after me because I'm called Chloe and that basically says it all as I am once massive stoner who loves weed and is trying to smoke every strain going but this is amazing ! 🍁❤️🍁❤️🍁❤️”"
