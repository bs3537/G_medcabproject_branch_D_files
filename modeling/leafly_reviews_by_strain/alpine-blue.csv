The onset is quick then settles into a focused and energetic calm that would be great for daytime use. I'm surprised this isn't made more widely available. It's hard to find, but worth the effort. Absolutely the best strain for arthritis, spasms, and general pain relief.”"

Very intense rush and feeling like your trapped in the space/time continuum for an hour or so before coming down to couch lock after a couple hours. Got this from the breeder, Evergreen Farms in AZ.”"

The flavour is very sweet and earthy...almost like a forbidden fruit lol. Every time I smell it my mouth waters! I feel more of the Indica in this strain...gives me.m a full relaxed body high with a slight euphoric feel. Not so much energetic in my opinion but it varies when I take it. Would recommend this to anyone else!”"
