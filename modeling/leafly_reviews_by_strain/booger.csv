Darker leaves, but bright trich's blanket the buds.
Satisfying, appealing aroma isn't matched, but yet accompanied by a sweet taste. That of fruity pebbles, or sherbert. Head high is minimal at first, with the heaviness being that of the indica. From head to toes, deep relaxation creeps in, leaving a sedated effect. With that, the sativa creeps and becomes more noticeable. Tru...”"

Every bud has its own uniqeness. Unlike all the other dispensaries that have a bunch of the same boo boo make sure you go to swell farmacy so you can see for yourself.”"

stevenkitzinger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/booger/reviews/1394069,"“Get this now! That being said. if you like super fucking thick fucking smoke that is Powerfully Pungent and leaves a delightfully heady blissfully citrus feel in the nostrils and on the taste buds that is  reminiscent of sitting in chair on the beach eating a mango and receiving oral pleasure simultaneously. Swell indeed.”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/booger/reviews/1540251,"“Great combination of strawberry cough & bubba kush. Whoever thought to put these complete opposites together is a genius. 
I've been keeping my eyes open for the concentrate, the flower is just beautiful.  I wouldn't recommend heavily consuming this strain if you're a beginner, the sativa parent might give you some anxiety.
If you can find this strain grab as much as you can.”"

Sweet/fruity and not very harsh. The high was so intense that it was like being a kid stoned for the first time. Giggly and super euphoric. The only strain that I don't feel comfortable driving on.

Almost immediately after smoking, I was overcome with pretty intense anxiety and a panic attack which lasted a while. Once that subsided, I mostly just felt brain dead and lazy. Also made me really horny, for whatever reason. Probably won't get this again once I run out,  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with anxiety.”"
