Sour Apple is that girl in your class who you didn't even know was in your class to begin with. She is plain, boring and doesn't seem to give a damn about anyone around her. You're at party and every hot girl there is either too good for you to approach her or you're scared of that buff guy around her who you think is her boyfriend. Life sucks now because your plan...”"

The Bud: Super frosty as if these small dime shaped funky chunky looking nugs that are light green and have bright sherbert hairs; these are super dense to bust open, lots of cbg is released and the trichs on my finger tips aren't coming off. Dunked in the sugar bo...”"

blaqhippiejesus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-apple/reviews/1332692,"“Sour Apple is a wonderful, gentle hybrid strain.  I'd like to categorize it as sativa-dominant, but there is a nice body component that develops in longer smoke sessions.  This strain's mental effects are on the quiet, introspective side of things.  Reflective and soft, rather than mentally energizing, Sour Apple is a great choice when needing a moment to think things through.  The relaxed body high that evolved as I...”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-apple/reviews/1350683,"“This was one of the more expensive strains that I've bought. The great thing about sour apple is that you are very much aware of how high you are, so if you wanted to smoke and run some errands, you'd very easily be able to moderate yourself. Not to mention that after about 2 bowls, I was FLYING. Everything was hilarious, and there wasn't a single sad thought in my mind, even a few days after smoking (I go on toleran...”"

This strain is gentle and it doesn’t give you that “wow I’m definitely high” feeling, but that can certainly be a good thing. That’s why this strain is best for the nighttime. If you wanna just chill out and clear your mind. If you want to feel good all over this is the strain for you. After one hit I feel so relaxed and focus...”"
OCWeedReview,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-apple/reviews/1414846,"“There have been some beautiful late harvest buds around the OC lately, busty and plump, with coatings of amber trichromes.  Sour Candy Apple has dark leaves and light emerald flowers, flush with pale hairs.  There is a fruit scent similar to an apple or pear.  It’s a bit piney also, but barely so.  The buds I got were really fresh, making them hard to break up.  Once they dried after a moment or two on a dish, they w...”"

Terpene quality is through the roof. 

It feels like a good blend between Indica and Sativa; my face gets the tingly, melting feeling while im flying over skylines in my mind. But if it were anything, it leans towards the Indica side. 
Another user stated it already,...”"

KushedKat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-apple/reviews/1336284,"“With notes reminiscent to Granny Smith Apple, this cross of Sour Diesel and Cinderella 99, abolishes stress, provides plenty of pain relief, and gives a boost of energy, staying true to being to its sativa roots. 
You will be licking your lips after trying this strain.

I took a nice joint of this and went biking, and it was the most carefree and lovely trips I've had.
