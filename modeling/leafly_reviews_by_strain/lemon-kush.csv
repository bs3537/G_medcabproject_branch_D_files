Lemon is ever so present all throughout. The nugs smell strongly of Lemon. The nugs are SO tightly compact - THEY SNOKE YOU, you do not smoke them! Lemon aftertaste is very strong in the mouth! That is saying something given it's THAT present through the smoke. A strain that will cause dry-mouth (no cotton mouth). VERY heavy sedation, novice users start slowly with dosage.

I acquired a purple x and it was delicious.
Strong piney lemony aroma, quickly fills up the whole house. Blanketed in crystallization, it glimmers in the light. Its almost a shame to smoke.
