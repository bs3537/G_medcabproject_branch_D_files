Flower: beautiful smaller sized nuggets. Nothing extraordinary in color or frost. 
Smell: piney kush earthiness. What I would  expect from the parent strains. 
Crumble: good and fluffy. 
Burn: even and clean. 
Taste: on exhale you get the OG Kush dominance. Piney and fresh. 
High: all other things about this strain are average but the high is not. It is superb. This knocks you on y...”"

Last time I really smoked was about 20 years ago.  Let's just say after a smallish bowl , it was like floating in front of a freight train then getting your body completely pulverized into a pink mist.  I chuckled as I found myself walking in circles a few times.  Yes it is that good.  I have tried about 30 strains since then and o...”"
daynedimmick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/supermax-og/reviews/1382074,"“I wouldn't recommend this for new smokers or occasional smokers. SMOG will get you about as high as you can get. So, just be prepared for that. Also wouldn't recommend smoking before doing anything important, because SMOG WILL make you sleepy and hungry, which leads to grumpy. It's great stuff though.”"

I'm a fan of heavy indica blends as well as sativa, and any hybrid in between.  I've tried about 20 strains in the last few months. !  ;)  .. I freakin love Supermax OG.  It's 70/30 Indica dominant and some people do feel like they get sleepy on it of course.  However...the relaxed yet pronounced euphoria and calming is so enjoyable that it puts me in the...”"

If I was stranded on a desert island with an unlimited supply of one strain this would be it.

This was by blue roots. #1 grower imo. This flower is what you see on the front page of high times for the month of April. Perfect strain for me. Not a good strain for the light smokers. Frosty wet lime green crystals with minimal dark to pine green long narrow leaves with long thin orange hairs. Very stinky like a tox...”"

natec,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/supermax-og/reviews/1386604,"“At first smell it's strong pine with what smells to me like orange zest or citrus . Once I grind it the skunk gets strong in this one. Seriously smooth and strong enough to pass on the second bowl. Thank you to my friends at Tru Med for the suggestion.”"
