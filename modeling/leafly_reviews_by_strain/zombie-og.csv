SmokinLioness,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-og/reviews/1394381,"“As a woman with strong cycles I need a good indica that puts me down.. PMS, cramps, bloating, unable to sleep due to discomfort, bitchy-ness...  Been trying Zombie and it's something special. Can't wait to make edibles out of it so I can feel it more in my body.”"
HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-og/reviews/1398152,"“What's that I smell? Lavender, you say...First thing I picked up was the linalool and the pinene. Flower is dark green with tricomes galore. I think Zombie OG has a terpene profile, and THC to CBD ratio that may benefit people looking to reduce pain and experience positive mood enhancement. Look for softer selections of this strain, and administer in small doses to assess tolerance. Heavy body feeling kicked in about...”"

JoeSlops,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-og/reviews/1373069,"“Zombie OG is a great nighttime strain that allows me to relax, slowdown and ultimately cradle me into a deep, refreshing sleep. Upon purchase the flowers exhibited delicious berry and fruit notes, but the longer it was kept in a glass jar, the smell took on a savory, butterscotch aroma.  Highly recommended strain!”"
Minnymich,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-og/reviews/1373413,"“Okay. So. You guys (Leafly) need to get the strain Zombie Stomp on here.  I'll just leave a review on this strain. Mat Lee and Mr. Doobee leave good reviews about it, if you can actually find information about it. Anywho, this supposedly indica leaning strain gives more of a head high when consumed in small amounts. It's a thinker and chatty type of high. Great conversations come with smoking this shit. When consumed...”"

TickTockCroc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-og/reviews/1517515,"“Wow. This one is for those with a high tolerance. I hit one bowl of this through a bong, and I didn't feel anything at first. I was pretty disappointed. Then all of a sudden out of nowhere, BAM! I'm standing there with my eyes closed, trying to comprehend the huge rush that's hitting me. I guess that's why they call it Zombie OG! Like a Zombie bite that infects you with time. Amazing strong indica that is great for p...”"

The girl behind the counter did warn me but i thought id have the tolerance to shut this down, instead i woke up in a pool of drool. Night night strain for sure”"

iamkeysersose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-og/reviews/1311666,"“So far, I really enjoy this strain. It's mellow, but not so mellow where I have couch lock, which is a good thing. I'm using it for edibles and I think it will be really good for pain relief, and it's mixed with agent orange, so hopefully the doses in the cannaoil will be not only potent, but long-lasting. Yes, this is a favorite 👍”"

If you smoke it correctly, it will give you a high similar to crack cocaine for a few seconds, but that is a poor shitty comparison but I can think of nothing else similar. It's like god giving you a hug. I don't neccesarily beleive in god(i've no idea)but if there was one and he could do that, then this is the strain or one of them. I have experienced similar traits but only from other source...”"

Interestly enough, more available in September than October. 4/5, a good fall treat every year but didn't find it to do much but treat anxiety in a different way than anything before.”"

When I bought this the name was "Purple Zombie" I can't seem to find that strain so hoping this is the closest on Leafly. 

Great body effects, just softly flowing through you, no anxiety, total dry mouth, a little pasty eyes (need water!). Ahh!! 😀

The smell of this bud is amazing. Smells so sweet you know there are good terpenes in there.
