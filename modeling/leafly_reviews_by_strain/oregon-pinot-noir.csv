Although 80% Sativa, w/ a wonderful, creative cerebral high w/out being speedy or inducing paranoia, it also has a strong, relaxing feel of an indica w/out inducing a brain-sucking couch-lock. Perfect strain👌, in my opinion. Note: this strain is 25-28% THC, so definitely not for light wieghts. ...”"

Look: Square solid gold/tan and flat chips, very nice. Probably the best look of the 8 differnt concentrates i just picked up( 8th of each, i do it for Jersey baby) .
Smell/Taste:  a sweet wineish grapey licorice taste, with a hint of kush,very distinct.
Effects: Straight heavy high n couchlock. Major pain relief and stress is gone. I was told this thing grows like a sativa but produces indi...”"

I am hoping that someone with the appropriate knowledge (I obviously don't have it) can explain how and why this is listed as a Sativa.”"

Moving from the east coast 15 years ago to Oregon one of the most charming aspects of the Willamette Valley was all the wineries.  So when hearing the name of this strain and seeing that both the parents are flowers I enjoy very much there was no doubt it was a must try strain.

So finally about a year later OPN s...”"

Tastes sour, fruity and hazy.  As I smoke more a more dominant haze flavor is noticed/becomes more pronounced.  The effects are pure haze upon the first hit.  A follow up hit results in a more hybrid come up and one begins to feel a little body kick in.  Subsequent hits result in a 50/50 hybrid split in th...”"

It kind of fell into that price area where is rather spend a little more for (seemingly) a lot stronger bud, or I'd rather pay a little more for a lot more quantity of something cheaper. However, it always stood out to me because of the name...and it loo...”"
