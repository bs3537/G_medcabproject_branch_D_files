Ebab-wel,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-haze/reviews/1310701,"“This strain is a great value. You should be able to find it at a lower price point. I vape and it performs well in my Pax2. The flower yields a nice earthy flavor with an abundance of vapor. The high is a nice balance of uplifting effects with no paranoia and a hint of muscle relaxation. Grown by Pioneer Nuggets. They are a pretty good grower.”"

olearyair,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-haze/reviews/1375452,"“DA Deep, Dark & Dank Domina Sativa Dominant Strain with Scents of Savory aged Stouts in aged bourbon barrels, the Pioneer Nuggets way. Tones of anise, fennel and black licorice that uplift and enlighten the spirit. Typical of a forbidden fruit with black buds along lime colored stems, a true contradiction of  social trends to define sativa vs indica effects.”"
PoignantTips,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-haze/reviews/1333439,"“oh brother! you have to examine this one closely. there are so many colors in it! they remind me of autumn with their deep shades of green and purple. I enjoyed finger busting this one down to catch the aromas bursting forth: very subtle flavors only those with clean palettes can appreciate. I'm not the type but I managed to rip a few hits that didn't make me cough and experienced some earthy tones with a tad of swee...”"

ijreem2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-haze/reviews/1174858,"“Had it last nigh 7% THC 12% CBD felt high without the paranoid feeling... I'm still looking for something with less THC . Not looking to get stoned, just want the pain to go. I've found that here in Washington at most of the recreational spots only have high THC percentage with very little CBD. But Black Haze was to bad for me.”"

jesfos,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-haze/reviews/1362524,"“I originally gave this a 2 star. I changed my mind. This does make me sleepy. not good for day time use as I was told, but it has a nice head high. Although it makes me tired it gave me enough energy and motivation to make a cauliflower grilled cheese. Don't ask. it's not worth the time. But I will say, I am a really good cook while high.”"
grumpfish1969,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-haze/reviews/1236538,"“One word: wow.  Slow clap.  This is a phenomenal sativa-dominant hybrid,  calming while remaining cerebral and energetic.  Awesome visual effects, a walk outside was incredible.  Gave me the munchies something fierce though.  

This was a hand-roll from Mister Bills of Buckley.  I normally vape, but treated myself with a J which may be why I found it so delightful.”"

This is by FAR the worst tasting strain I have ever tried. Normally I love the flavor of weed, even if it is a little diesely or skunky. This stuff, however, tastes like shoe leather, asphault, dandelions, and Starbucks Tribute Blend coffee.

That said, I still gave it four whole stars, because the effects are very nice.  Very ve...”"

dankaroo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-haze/reviews/1249118,"“I been exploring higher cbd strains. 4.36 % thc and 9.56% cbd. for me this was a perfect pick. I've been hesitant to smoke much because of my anxiety and PTSD but this just diminished all of those feelings. I can feel a little high without the negative paranoia affects I would normally get on higher thc based strains. I would definitely purchase this again. as for smell, it wasn't so appealing and taste is not the be...”"

I've been doing a lot of sampling strains lately and all of them have been exceptional quality, but Black Haze was special. Its color is such a dark, rich purple and the aroma, especially when broken a little,
Is more than just eye-watering and powerful, but has a smell totally unique. Definitely a strong "purple" base, but with an entire boquet of sweet, heavenly
scents all its own. T...”"

I usually stick with just indicas but this one I’ll definitely be getting again. No paranoia, no anxiety that I usually get with sativas either. Just wow.”"
Create8705,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-haze/reviews/1672607,"“I give 4 stars. While I think its cool that cannabis can produce fruity smells, it is not what I prefer. I personally just like my buds to smell earthy and piney. However, the high is absolutely amazing!! Very euphoric and instantly a rush of creativity! Love it! Oh and not at all sleepy after!”"
