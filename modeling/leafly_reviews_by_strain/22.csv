PesodaPlug,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/22/reviews/1747968,"“Too me it the high hit in fast but smooth at the same time. It’s nothing that’ll get you off your ass but it’s enough where you can have fun and chill. I might be me that I didn’t really get smacked because of my tolerance being high”"
ChrisMonte86,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/22/reviews/1797478,"“Great daytime strain, I personally use it right before I have a work out. It’s my go to pre-workout gym strain, I find myself getting lost in the music and the feeling of my body working as it also keeps me anxiety free calm and almost in a Meditative state while pushing my body to its full potential!! 

Try smoking a joint of this and taking a spin class it’s awesome!! 

Much love fellow beings !”"
