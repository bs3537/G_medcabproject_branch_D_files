Valiko,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1413196,"“not everyday you get to smoke a bud with 29.1% thc and what a bud it is!

first flight after two weeks dry was amazing even reminded acid trip little bit :) yet its not getting to the aroused-giggly feeling (maybe its just meh)

helps smoothing the bi-polar episodes, mood swings are less swingy and general mood is much better, ppl at work are finally tolerable.

the insomnia seems to be gone, sleeping is so much enjo...”"

This has me extremely uplifted and gives me pain relief.  I feel it's a wonderful daytime strain for depression or PTSD.  It gets me motivated!”"

11thThesis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1372878,"“Outstanding and likely the best of Med Releaf's Tikkun Olam 15 dollar strains. They claim the genetics are proprietary, but the name gives up the ghost, this is basically Alaskan Thunderfuck, perhaps crossed with their own Eran Almog.”"
abaylis97,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1394696,"“Got this strain from Medreleaf. Opened it up and first thought was it smelled awful, then after my first toke i realized it smelled like a beef pot roast, now i love it 😂”"
TB-303,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1412499,"“Pretty good smooth smoke. Doesn't make you feel cloudy, so great for daytime activities and getting things done. Has a very spicy, cedar taste that caught me by surprise since I love the smell of cedar, but have never tasted it so strong in a strain before. A nice high that's a combination of mellowness, relaxing feeling behind the eyes and some alertness, but not jittery at all, very chill. Reminds me a lot of Skunk...”"

T0K3R,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1387716,"“Alaska is a high THC strain. It has a nice uplifting high. It helps with my pain relief without having to use a lot of it to obtain the effects.”"
WhiteGyrfalcon,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1379059,"“Fasten and tighten your seat belt for the ride upward after three or four inhalations. The sativa jazz here hits strident notes in high THC octaves. This 'arctic' strain is not for the inexperienced, or faint of heart, and for me it generated far to much anxiety, racing mind, internal flutter as a by-product of a near vertical trajectory for 30 minutes, that will spin you out unless you are going to the disco. I am s...”"

Christa80,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1412501,"“Really enjoy this stuff. First time ordering it, and it's perfect! For me, I get more creative ideas, a relaxed body and overall happiness. I enjoy watching movies, or drawing on this stuff :)”"
guybasetrap,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1260557,"“This is what i called an uplifter!!! must say this is my favorite strain so far.

mr.chokabich2018,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1341306,"“Alaska, first time with this fantastic sativa, very smooth, smell and taste is phenomenal, earthy mint, keeps you afloat on a steady ride. Perfect gram count, fresh and ready for action. I always vape, but with this strain I actually had to go back to the roots with a fatty aswell. Either way, you won't be disappointed. Love how quickly my parcel arrived, and those lockable containers, brilliant, i'd love if all my L...”"

bradencox131,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1601966,"“For a strain with roughly 10% THC, it’s a bit deceptive about its potency. A very active high, I enjoy the energy I feel under it’s spell. A great aroma, earthy and not overwhelming, Alaska is a great name for this strain. Quality is great, though it dries out quickly.”"
hotdiggitydank,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1328570,"“Well worth the investment! The light green colors of the bud and the fresh smell are very inviting. I received this nice pleasant feeling and it seems to creep in and out but it is a great feeling. This worked on pain and I would recommend this for morning consumption with a nice cup of coffee.”"

cannabis saliva dominant end energized 
I was very inspired end felt artistically”"
cindiloo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1254012,"“Got mine through Med Releaf.  Plenty of aroma when I opened it, the flavour (when vaped) was a bit sweet, a bit minty, with a good dose of earthiness.  The effects started to kick in pretty quickly, starting off in the stomach, before moving up to the forehead, then face, then down to the solar plexus/chest area.  Feeling relaxed but clear headed, a little sleepy but not overwhelmingly so.  A faint ringing in the ear...”"

GreenAssassin420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaska/reviews/1738166,"“With this strain, things have a way of making sense. I feel as if my brain is on hyperdrive and I could make a life altering decision at any moment! It’s all about getting that first urge to get up off the couch, which can prove difficult after getting locked in to your favorite show or what not. It however, can be used as a creative pathway to the art of your choosing... though it cannot make one bold on its own. Ma...”"
