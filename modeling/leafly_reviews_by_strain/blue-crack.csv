Oldmedsmoker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-crack/reviews/1362434,"“Great house-cleaning weed.
The lack of a serious head-high is actually a plus for me as an MMJ patient and a severe RA sufferer. 
Makes me more tolerant physically and motivated mentally for tasks around the house and work.
If Bob The Builder smoked, this might well be his strain of choice.”"

Very helpful personally when I needed to start focusing and getting tasks done during the day. Also helpful with anxiety and if you need to strike yourself up an appetite. Heavy red eyes, though! 😁”"
