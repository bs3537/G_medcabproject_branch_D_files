Nice pungent smell with a bit of sweetish smell to it. 

Thick dense nugs loaded with fiery red hairs. The nug itself speckled with hues of dark green and purple.

Not to mention it looks as is powered diamonds were sprinkled over them. So frosty.

Very uplifting yet relaxing high. I feel the need to just phase out of existence while I just write to my hearts desire.”"

I have become a fan of Cresco as of late.  They always throw a Boveda 58 in their bulk flower!  Definite perk!  When I opened this up it looked like a dead octopus still trying to camouflage itself.  Very dark initially, little red/orange hairs everywhere like feelers, and pungent.  Almost looked lik...”"

I saw one of its parents are StarDawg (one of my all time favs) so I had to pick it up.

First of all, KT Dawg has a very unique and distinct flavor that you’ll probably either love or hate. The best way I can describe it is like raw mushrooms (not the magic kind). I like mushroom...”"

StudentoftheLeaf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kt-dawg/reviews/1658687,"“1st, absolutely gorgeous to look at. I wasn’t expecting the hues of black/purple against almost copper hairs. The buds themselves are less dense then you’d expect, but they break up beautifully in my Sharpe Stone grinder. Nice, long lasting cerebral head space with this strain. You can focus creatively if your inclined, or just people watch. The flavor profile wasn’t as pronounced as I’d have liked. That said, my wat...”"
