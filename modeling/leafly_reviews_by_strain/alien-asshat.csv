Alien Asshat
=============
Jacob87,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-asshat/reviews/1369157,"“Wow. On the inhale notes of fruit and citrus really come through leaving you smacking your lips to continue tasting the draw. Uplifts and really pierces my frontal lobe. Not racy or overwhelming. Good strain for being around a bunch of people. Can't emphasize enough how fun this one is. Lower doses great for activities where higher doses leave me contemplating staying in my sitting position in a relaxing haze.”"
NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-asshat/reviews/1351030,"“Really fun high! With a Total THC at 29.97% I wasn't sure what to expect, it turns out that the high was really much more mild than I was expecting, and by mild I mean zero anxiety, zero couch locky gotta stay in one place kinda feeling. The bud is very dense with a kinda sweet skunky smell that turns out to be a citrus flavor when the smoked. So all in all its a strain that tastes pretty good, with a fun high that i...”"

Good strong, long lasting high that doesn't make you fall asleep. Also creates a large amount of kief and grinds/rolls nicely. Will definitely buy this weed again.”"

NorthsideIrish,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-asshat/reviews/1249665,"“Had for the first time last night and it was pretty solid, but to be honest I was expecting more from a strain with this high THC. 

It didn't hit me instantly, but rather slowly built up. I was already in a good mood, but it had been a very long day. Alien was pretty uplifting with some 'carefree' effects as well as being a small motivator. 

I like the strain and I will be smoking again, but I wasn't knocked on my ...”"

This strain is actually pretty stony, but not as much as the THC content would suggest. It tends towards the sativa side of hybrid. What disappointed me was the almost total lack of taste or smell. It's slightly grassy and earthy. I will probably smoke the rest of it, a dayti...”"

AnfieldRiot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-asshat/reviews/1349661,"“First time trying the Asshat and thus far it's been an enjoyable experience and is close to earning itself a place in my top 5. The high is smooth and uplifting, a very positive feeling. Two things standout for this high, I've never slept better, super deep sleep and no burnt feeling when awakening. I've also noticed that sex is also heightened as well, so there's that too. All in all, I've been toking only twice per...”"
