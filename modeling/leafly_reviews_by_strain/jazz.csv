amazony711,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1447266,"“I've been smoking it for about a week, maybe two. I seriously hurt my back a couple days ago and van barely walk. Jazz has been such a life saver. It's pain control level is amazing. For the last couple days, I've been on average about 6/10-12/10 on the pain scale and its helped me cut the edge down so I can relax. I have oxycodon, but can only take it every 6 hours and it makes me nauseas anyways. So happy I have Ja...”"

BiggieJ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1313620,"“I thought it was a bright, clean, cerebral effect with no notable couch lock attribute I could detect anyway. 
A must for the daytime working hours.”"
GrampaGrumpy420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1354417,"“Clear high...not buzzy which left me wanting more  citrus pepper taste  lingers with a dry mouth feel”"
amazony711,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1521561,"“This is my pain strain. It makes me feel like I'm curled up in a blanket of cats who are purring....while drinking the perfect temperature of hot coco. I have disk problems and nerve pain and this relaxes my entire body which eliminates the pain.”"
amazony711,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1442814,"“Definitely sinks me into the couch, which is what I was looking for, high lasts a long time. Put 4 stars because I was looking for a strain that didn't make me hungry, or think I'm hungry, and this strain didn't have that as a side effect. I'm pretty sure I ate all my new groceries last night.”"
edgydrifter,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1357671,"“Vaped coarsely-ground in my MFLB.  Mild aroma, pleasant fruity-tart flavor like peach skin.  Good, strong high.  Some visual distortion--flattened depth perception and color enhancement.  Intense body high, very tingly and uplifted.  Felt like being tickled from the inside.  Initial high seems to fade after about forty-five minutes, but then returns in waves for another hour.  Would definitely buy again.”"
BNSlums,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1336565,"“Good smooth smoke. The citrus smell is phenomenal. Clear high that leaves one able to accomplish any daily tasks easily. Daytime smoke.”"
bouncyroo11,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1625060,"“My new fave. It's a high sativa, very energetic and happy weed. I really enjoy it. I don't recommend smoking this at night.”"

fibrogal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1308645,"“Really enjoyable & compliments CBD strains perfectly.  It's great for still being functional but relaxed. The happy relaxation lasts long after the buzz wears off. Good for people who don't want to be too stoned when they're stoned or used more medicinally.”"
Wizardtears,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1542285,"“This rare bud is a must-buy if you see it - a perfect body high with stimulating happiness/calmness effects that turn it into a sort of 'seasoned users' functional high.”"

Tropwhen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1340852,"“Nice smooth flavored. Hints of flower in the taste. No coughing for me. Vaped it, not much of a smell. Definitely feels nice. Felt my creative juices flowing. Gave it 3 stars because the effect doesn't last that long. I do like it though.”"

godsindeath,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jazz/reviews/1499200,"“If your looking for a head high, move on.  But this will get you feeling good, focused and productive.  I need to be punched in the face a little harder myself.  2 hits off a $9 joint and I'm feeling great!”"
