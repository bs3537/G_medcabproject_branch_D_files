I used this strain during a rather severe Anxiety Attack; to my amazement after only smoking about 0.2g the Anxiety was COMPLETELY GONE!!! It's terpene profile is reminiscent of blueberry pancakes with sweet & earthy undertones.”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/quin-n-tonic/reviews/1259022,"“Quin-N-Tonic is my favorite of the 4-5 high CBD strains I've tried... it's a mix of dark green, purple and almost blue hues and smells almost sweet. The addition of cannatonic to Harlequin reduced the face-melty, hard-to-focus quality I dislike in Harlequin. I ended up mixing a couple grams with some Bay 11 and it made for an incredibly relaxing, happy, clear headed smoke.”"

Djack45,https://www.leafly.com/indica/quin-n-tonic/reviews/1371090,"“I like this strain a lot because it is a very relaxing and mellow strain.  Doesn't really make you feel "high" due to the fact that it is a CBD dominant strain.  I would recommend to anyone dealing with stress or anxiety.”"

Bright orange hairs all throughout the dense yet fluffy nugs. Slight "cat piss" aroma which I associate with the Quin part of this Tonic, however the taste is still enjoyable. Great to ease racy ...”"

I wouldn't recommend this one for depression, it wasn't particularly uplifting. But if you're needing clarity or help sleeping, Quin is wise and soft.”"
