emichaud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1352172,"“I've probably smoked my weight in marijuana many times over in the past couple of decades and THIS IS MY FAVORITE. Zero anxiety, zero paranoia, just pure relaxing peaceful body high with some euphoria and giggles. Interesting flavor but I don't smoke pot for the taste or smell. Super strong-- three hits and I'm good for the night with no headaches, no depression, no pain. I can get things done if I want to OR sleep. ...”"
Mangeykko,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1351757,"“Bought 3 grams of this and boy it was smelly, it is really dank too, buds are long and slender and very shiny with all the sticky trichomes, they will stick to anything, even inside a different container (after i ground some up for my vape pen). first let me say i haven't had a cheese strain before, but this bud is a new taste that i love. The smoke was very smooth, a mix of sativa smoothness and the somewhat rough h...”"

Stephiney,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1370252,"“Not the largest or most beautiful nugs you'll find (at least with this batch),  but I cannot complain about it's taste or potency.  Very sugary smelling and tastes like Sweet pink grapefruit.  Delicious!  A little will get you nicely relaxed,  a little more will put you to sleep. Very nice appetite stimulant as well,  but don't carb out and fall out or you'll wake up feeling icky,  trust me 😉.  Would've been 5 stars...”"
CherryKushFan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1363420,"“Pungent, great to relax. Puts me to sleep after a days work. Great for playing video games or listening to stand-up comedy.”"
massoud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1278847,"“This strain caught my eye in QP nug jar. Was calling me and what a nice strain. I love good cheese has nice x contrast while keeping cheese structure and smell. Good head body balance great for game time.”"
derderder,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1255478,"“I got this strain from my local medical dispensary. it smells great! has a bit of a sharp smell, but not too piercing. After 2 hits from my bong I was already feeling relaxed especially in my shoulder/arm/upper back and head area. nice and warm with a small bit of tingles. my anxiety and pain completely went away, and I could just chill with my wife and son. Not my favorite strain, but I would for sure smoke again es...”"
IlikeCats520420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1275086,"“Nice skunky spicy cheese smell mixed with a vague sweet smell. Light green with tons of orange hairs some crystals but not that noticeable. Good effects for night time. This strain makes me hungry, pain free, relaxed and ready for bed. Taste could be better for this particular batch. Overall smell, look and effects are great I'd give this batch a 5 star if it tasted better.”"

Delana95,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1208098,"“Incredibly stinky. I don't get a fruity smell from this strain, but more pungent and sour. The buds are also kinda small, albeit very dense. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars. The high is super mellow and relaxing. Give Cheese Candy a try, especially if you like super stinky bud!”"

Crazyred444,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1238514,"“This was an interesting strain but I really enjoyed it. I've never smoked a cheese before so idk if that's why the smoke tasted different, but it was a taste I really enjoyed. Probably one of my favorite. I was also a little worried because I didn't want the munchies. But I actually didn't get any munchies. I've been having a lot of GI pain lately and swiftly took all that pain away and I had no hunger. I felt very u...”"

drumdude91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1317480,"“Fantastic strain! Heavy head high at first. The head high softened up and was followed by a really damn heavy body high. I was glued to the couch for hours. Great strain for those in pain or having trouble sleeping. Easy grow for beginners.”"

Blackhawks15,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1227410,"“Absolutely not recommended for the novice, this was the first herb I bought with my medical card.  After I smoked half a bowl, I got so paranoid that I couldn't remember if I'd driven home from work or took the train, it really freaked me out.  The taste was pungent, true to the name.  I passed out about an hour after enjoying Cheese Candy, not sure if it is really that potent or if I should have tried something else...”"
ss925,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1243550,"“Smells like sweet fruity candy, with earthy tones, my all time fav!”"
Claudegreengrass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1286533,"“A nice smooth and relaxing strain, but I would say it smells more musky like cat p*s* than cheesy and I mean that in the best possible way. maybe its the skunk side of it who knows but i've had this strain many times(N.E. England) and it always smells the same and its always really nice.”"
WeedPriest,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1332164,"“Cheese Candy'a effects take a little while to fully it but once they do it's a mellow, calm high. Though this strain is not too potent it is a nice way to relax after a long day.”"
KooLCat7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1223306,"“Oh man. I got this as a pre roll. Don't know what else to say other than it gave me an extremely bad case of the spins and my mind kept overthinking everything. Eventually, I puked my brains out and spewed my soul into the toilet. I then crawled to my bed and wished I'd never been born.”"
Garedicus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1341574,"“I picked up a gram of this, grown by Doc Croc, harvested 9/18/2016, consumed sometime in late January, 2017. There are no notes on the package regarding pesticides or grow location, but doccroc.net states that they use no pesticides and grow everything hydroponically with a perlite/coco mixed media. The smell was sweet, cheesy, and pungent, all of which carried over to the taste. As far as the high is concerned, I've...”"

ghostinthetoast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1351756,"“Good social bud, nice contained high that leaves the wits intact, slaps down social anxiety, and provides a peaceful, cheesy feeling.

Tragically I was let down however.  

Big negative for me was the "weed hangover", a strong anxious feeling in the chest which lasted well into the next day.  Bad vibes.”"
MrManOverThere,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1460651,"“This strain is great. Perfect for just a "go to" on a busy day. It's pretty clear headed after the first hour or so, and doesn't make me tired at all while still calming. Eases my anxiety even if I have some and go to work. Great strain, not the best for intense socializing or task-based situations where you have to recall information on the fly, but would we wanna smoke for that anyways??”"
LAZYFUGITIVE,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cheese-candy/reviews/1355533,"“good night time strain for eating &/or sleeping

i topped my bowl of this delicious bud with some PURA EARTH/sativa/SPACE ROCK, it was good night after that!
