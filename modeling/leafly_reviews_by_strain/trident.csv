millsbaker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1378875,"“Trident is a sativa-indica hybrid with an extraordinary concentration of CBD (12%) and quite low THC (6%); as such, it's useful if you need the medical relief provided by CBD but don't want to feel high.

It has a unique taste and small, and was as sticky as anything I've ever touched!

I used it for two purposes: (1) migraines and nausea, and (2) letting someone who reacts to marijuana with paranoia and anxiety ...”"
HolbySouth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1416562,"“Trident is one of my go-to strains. At my collective Caliva, it is a very affordable bottom-shelf strain, but don't let the low price fool you. This is the best high-CBD strain I've found to date, and it has recently replaced Green Crack as my "focus medication" as it isn't nearly as psychoactive.

My wife unfortunately experiences an uptick in anxiety from high-THC strains, so she is only able to medicate with high-...”"

Taste: Delicious. Lemon sherbet.

Effects: Within a minute or three you'll experience instant relief from aches and pains. Tension fades, as does anxiety. Mild, calming psychoactive effects.”"

celestialheart99,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1347489,"“This is a great strain! It is a high cbd strain that is almost perfectly balanced.  Doesn't get me high, just makes me feel like the best version of myself.  It relaxed my brain without relaxing my eyes and body.  It keeps me focused on the tasks at hand.  It also does NOT cause me any panic attacks.  I have had panic attacks before from heavy indica strains.  The indica did not help me relax because they were so hig...”"
SFpsycho,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1347490,"“I purchased this strain from a local dispensary to treat some severe arthritis pain in my knee. I chose the Trident for the high level of CBD; 12.2% CBD & 5.8% THC. I wanted something that I would be able to smoke during the day without any sort of "stoney" aftereffects. The effects aren't super long lasting, but I often "notice" that it's been awhile between when I last felt pain after smoking. Definitely try this o...”"
KronicK707,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1416561,"“One of my favorite CBD strains. This grown by HPRC, has a strong nose and taste. My favorite to be functioning throughout the day. If I'm looking to pick up this strain, I prefer HPRC grown compared to other vendors.”"
GothicLucien,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1435290,"“Pretty good day time maybe for a weekend morning for me. Pretty relaxing and good for pain but i found it doesn't last for long still a good medical strain in my opinion. Very easy to grow and easy to get to yeld well.  I would recommend it as a first grow for sure!”"
benjigold,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1384014,"“I was using it for it's CBD properties, but did not expect to get high. Granted it wasn't a bad high or a heavy high, but enough to know I was feeling it. After about 5 min I was ready for bed, falling asleep on the couch. Relaxed, tingly, comfortable. So this strain will definitely help with insomnia. My original pain had subsided, though I did feel new pain from getting up. Waking up the next day I did feel better ...”"

karlwireless,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1442000,"“This is for what the label calls a 2:1 CBD/THC. It doesn't say what percentage of each. 

Having been using Harlequin for a while, I find that this Trident relaxes me as much without getting me in the least bit jittery. I was able to go through a full bowl and felt good the entire time. 

If anyone knows where I can find this strain in Flower, let me know and definitely try it!”"
Cjbarret,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1651948,"“Fantastic CBD strain, sticky flowers and relatively easy to grow. My go to CBD.”"
the_preroller,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1722491,"“Having over 8 different strains at home, this is the one that gets me the most excited after work. It has thick, sticky buds with a light green / golden texture, and has a perfectly fresh and earthy scent.

The effects of this strain are relaxation, comfort, and satisfaction. I feel creative and calm, say goodbye to stress, and still feel clear minded with reduced aches and pains.

This strain is hard to come by, but...”"
Alexiacee83,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1294479,"“I don't like to feel foggy, so this was a great strain for me. I walked all day with no pain, I talked to all sorts of people with no anxiety and I had a general feeling of happiness and slight euphoria. This is perfect for beginners, or if you want to stay focused and happy all day. 5 stars!”"
GCWellness,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1286886,"“Wow, not sure who grew this but he deserves a handshake and a 5/5 star rating. This is by far one of the best and most potent strains that I've tried in a while.”"
FonkFiend,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1741882,"“Smells of sweet, piney, and with a hint of citrus, reminds me a bit of lemon jack x thin mint cookies or something.”"
panYpaz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/trident/reviews/1148321,"“A good friend and I went to go pick up another friend and go for a cruise. When he got in the car he broke out a bag of Trident which smelled Pine/minty and fresh. Packed a fat sherlock of it  and drove around some side streets. The cruise felt like I was propelling slowly through warm clouds as the CBD dominated my body. The body high sensationalized all over my body slowly tingling outward in waves like having warm...”"
