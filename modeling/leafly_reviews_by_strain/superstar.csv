Nojusarturo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superstar/reviews/1344506,"“My favorite strain that keeps me motivated about each and every day I'm able to some this good weed.”"
thuggerxthugger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superstar/reviews/1587150,"“This is easily top 3 strains I've ever smoked. Especially when I started smoking it and it was still fresh, the body high was literally pure pleasure. I didn't need anything, I just sat there and was completely happy with everything. It is a hybrid though, so the sativa-heavy half fucked with my brain just like most sativas. Lots of weird out-of-pocket theories and "realizations" that are later pretty stupid and some...”"

Roo182,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superstar/reviews/1414721,"“I really liked this strain for relaxing and reading a book. The flavour isn't that prominent, however there were no negatives off a couple of hits from the vape. Definitely more sativa dominant.”"

hawkchiefs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superstar/reviews/1664129,"“Superstar OG is a exceptionally potent hybrid strain enhancing every part of your life as soon as the first intake. With the flower actually smelling of sweet, berry  flowers(however that works). Anwy, anywhere close its a must to get;) (4.5/5)”"

wassafax,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superstar/reviews/1344504,"“Never heard about this one before smoking it. Probably won't talk much about it afterwards (so maybe that's why people don't seem to know much about this strain). Relaxed mental high, energetic.”"
