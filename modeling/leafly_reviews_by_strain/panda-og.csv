NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1413329,"“This is definitely a top shelf strain that Grow Op Farms (Phat Panda) seems to grow absolutely perfectly every time I've had it it's looked flawless the high is upbeat with plenty of energy while still giving a nice relaxing body buzz. The flavor is something that really sets this strain apart it's very original the berry flavors go great with the OG Chem and you can tell just by looking in the jar that the stuff is ...”"
roguemusic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1412315,"“it has a very strong sativa Buzz but the downsize to this strain is how much it made me cough. anybody is better off vaping this strain unless u enjoy the feeling of shitting in your pants while u cough lol.”"
CoryNiel,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1352858,"“Good solid smoke. I'm a night time smoker and this bud does the trick. Not a tired high. It not energetic either. It's perfect for relaxing and watching some TV before bed or maybe a little video gaming before shutting down for the night.
Once bed is the target it puts together an amazing nights sleep.”"

I recently picked up an 8th of Panda OG, I bought it strictly by its looks. Large dense nugs that look like they had all been rolled around in keif beforehand. Now my go-to wake n bake bud. Thanks Phat Panda for supplying the PNW with the dankest pot around!”"

petergreen80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1317244,"“It has an interesting artificial berry flavor, like berry candy with a slight chemical flavor.  The high was more energetic and trippy feeling than I had expected.  I wanted something more relaxed on my first try, so it caught me off guard.  It was enjoyable, just not what I was expecting.  The high reminded me of Amnesia Haze.  There was a nice body high and an energized yet trippy head high with some time distortio...”"

inditiva0,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1324600,"“Super trichome-y, like it's sprinkled with powdered sugar. Chemy taste with sour berry undertones giving the happy and euphoric effects reminiscent of og chem coupled with a nice body tingle.”"

noisyturtle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1307505,"“Secured some Phat Panda shatter this week. The high is strong and very sativa heavy, perhaps a little too much because this left me feeling jittery. Although motor functions were decreased, the strain allowed for greater focus and gave me a bit more pep in my step. I had to knock off a full star due to it's irregular harshness. Even a small pull would leave me in coughing fits, and my lungs tingled for a good bit aft...”"

Darrelltj78,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1323566,"“Thought the day I first smoked OG Chem it was the best weed in twenty years , but it became the parent of it. Panda OG, for me, is the best overall strain out there. Dense nugs, sweet smell ,amazing herb. Phat Panda always comes thru, and is actually worth the extra money, any strain. trust me.      Great job guys!!!!”"
TheVioletHour,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1329771,"“Uplifting buzz with no droopy eyes. Slight paranoia and anxiety. This is not a particularly happy high but there is a sense of being present and in the moment, not rocketing off into space. It's easy to get engrossed in YouTube or video games, but not books unfortunately. The short term memory fail is really noticeable. That's ok though, because your thoughts will meander pleasurably and you may experience small epip...”"
shortandstaudt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1312967,"“A nice, clean experience. The taste is not mundane; rather, the taste is energetic: earthy yet smooth. The Total Cannabinoid content is impressive at 26.2%. I feel focused and I have experienced moderate pain relief.”"
mstoneburgh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1258706,"“Great uplifting high. 
Not too strong of a Diesel taste.”"
Mandac0nda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1339486,"“Picked this puppy up from Kush 21 down next to the SeaTac airport. So frosty. Great head high, almost trippy. Excellent quality. Will be  phat pandas newest fan.”"
glindathegoodkush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1315264,"“Extremely earthy taste, incredibly pleasant. Rather smooth burn with minimal coughing. For a sativa-dominant hybrid, this kush seems to have quite some indica attributes. Definite couch lock strain, love it !!!!”"
25yearvet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1752422,"“Taste is ok, berry-chem.  Looks ok, burns great.  The thing is it doesn't seem very potent,  I smoke a lot and that has to take away one star.”"
parkerfoshay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1650716,"“This is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I can always count on this to take away my pain and anxiety. Good during both the day and night.”"
mikezinn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1273280,"“I got the vaporizer version and wow! great pull, really mellowed me out without making me too tired.  some cough on the first few pulls but other than that is is great!”"
rizlo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1382987,"“last 3 days i tried grow op farms(phat panda stuff) strains..golden pineapple,chem og,panda og,purple panda reserve. i gotta tell golden pineapple is really bad weed. chem og has pros and cons. good but not superb..but panda og and purple panda reserve is really really good. while purple has more psychedelic indica type that panda og is strong sativa-hybrid stuff. it's good”"
Kash0427,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1420957,"“Nice high. Great for making you feel chill and relaxed during the day and sleep at night. Does have light harsh burn, so i do suggest to drink water before and after lighting it up.”"
nater82,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1388663,"“unimpressed by the smell and taste. phat panda is normally on point when I come visit. the high is good though, just missing that og aroma and taste”"
Ladkahaidesi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/panda-og/reviews/1276331,"“My #1 go to weed. Phat Panda has a great Panda OG strain. Highly recommended this, good head high and a chill undertone.”"
