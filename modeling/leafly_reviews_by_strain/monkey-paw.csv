Monkey Paw
=============
Stevenspowersports,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1394127,"“5/5.

Old Michigan Cut. Some of the classic, tight, sticky icky icky you can get around here. Pungent, fruity, spicy aroma, and Rocklike, sugar-coated buds of Lime and Pink. It is so much like a Kush cut but with NONE of the crashy, heaviness of the afghani roots. The best strain for paranoia and anxiety, a crippling duo that my friend says is crushed by the Monkey's paw.”"
MrMedicineMan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1387538,"“Smells super skunky and tastes skunky with citrusy after tones. Very happy smoke focused, and creative. Yields very Nicely finished at about 70 days. Long dark green finger like buds I love everything about this strain”"
instg8ter,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1374893,"“Being from MI I remember getting the original cut back in my HIGH school daze. Used to come in once a year from outdoor grows in saline, i have always loved the earthy tones and as for appearance, it's the gnarliest looking bud you'll ever see. I was just reintroduced after 35 years a few weeks ago and and am writing this while laxing out to my final nugget....Heaven!!!”"
geppygep,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1374894,"“THE BEST tasting in my 30+ smoking years.  I grow and breed these seeds and cross EVERY strain with this male.”"
Zinzah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1598664,"“Had a skunky, slight citrus taste, with earthy undertones. The strain that I smoked was called Red Monkey Paw, not sure if it is a child of Monkey Paw, but it smoked nice. Had a focused, relaxed high.”"
MitchellandFinese,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1505159,"“Being a Michigan native this strain was a must grab when I saw it and learned about the history. 
I can honestly say that it didn’t take long for the high to creep up on me. The pine taste on the inhale and the berry taste of the exhale makes this the perfect smoke. If you ever have the chance to grab it I would HIGHLY recommend.”"
MMConnoisseur182,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1326543,"“Just smoked this strain out here in good old So-Cal & just gotta say damn!....Super potent with a smooth finish. Definitely one of my top 10!”"
boy_nutella,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1650805,"“Almost like it was custom made for me specifically, great feeling all around, easy to grind but slightly more challenging to pack densely, definitely had some purple in there, impressive and one of the best from Michigan to be honest.”"

Felton18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1453029,"“This strain is ok. I like how dense and big the bugs are. Love the purple color the strain has. Good focused high and euphoric. The only downside of this is the sleepy after affect. I don't really care for certain strains that makes you sleepy.”"
1kushking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1680673,"“This rare Hybrid strain was a treat. THC level 15%. I first got the sativa effects, making me uplifted & happy. When alone, drifting into deep thoughts. When the Sativa weakens the Indica effects kick in making me very relaxed & even sleepy. Strain gives you two nice separate highs in one! Skunky, citrus, & pine, was the taste & smell i received. The sticky buds were darker green with burnt orange hairs. There is no ...”"

blissedoutbabe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1244761,"“One of my favorites so far. It looks beautiful but it smells like fart haha. It has a powerful high but with no paranoia. I feel like "all is right in the world" when I smoke it 😎 Definitely buy this if you see it!”"
AlexanderDMZ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1804559,"“Just tried it out and it has a very nice taste and is great for my symptoms. I may use sleepy Indica strains during the day, or a stimulating Sativa at night. This is uplifting and helps with depression.”"

Agent907,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monkey-paw/reviews/1367401,"“I remember this strain. I would tell people about this herb like a legendary mythical creature. It was the early 80's when I discovered this weed that I'm surprised has sativa orgins. This shitt iz NICE and STRONG. I was a teenager so my tolerance was low AF, but this was another level indeed. All I know is this strain will get you HAF!!!”"
