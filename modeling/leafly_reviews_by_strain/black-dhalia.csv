Black Dahlia
=============
CosmicBlort,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-dhalia/reviews/1143810,"“This bud is very dark, almost black in color. It is noticeably darker in color than any other bud that sits next to it.
The taste is almost cigar-like, with a smoky strong taste that is not in any way like skunk or 'normal' bud. It's a great after dinner smoke, with a shot of single malt or port wine.
The effects are of course different according to the user, but was enjoyable for me, not in a debilitating way, jus...”"

Stossa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-dhalia/reviews/1159789,"“This is flat out the best Nighttime strain in the book for me! THC levels regularly at 21%, CBD regularly around 3%, this strain is the best at allowing me to get a good night sleep while controlling my pain, so much so that I regularly use it to ween down further on pain medication at night, it provides so much pain relief. Death Star & my own home grown Mr. Nice Guy are the only other strains that even come close t...”"

vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-dhalia/reviews/1317926,"“This strain was just relaxing. Not much psycho-activity. I started to wonder if it was weed. It was relaxing leading me to think it must be high CBD.  I blended it with some sativa which was not so good for pain, and found the combination was excellent. For $5gm, I can improve the pain killing power of other strains.”"

jleeishigh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-dhalia/reviews/1247549,"“One of my absolute favorites. Looks like deep purple, almost black roses. Gorgeous. Good for calming down and anxiety before attacks to prevent, and after to wind down. I mix in a little for the daytime to keep me chill, then just this in the evening. Too much makes me sleepy, but it's perfect when I am trying to sleep. 
If goth weed is a thing, this is it. <3”"

Confidential or any of the more "peppery" herbs. Black Dahlia certainly has some rubbery undertones though, and I view it as a nice Daytime Herb.”"
fizzyfyre,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-dhalia/reviews/1163404,"“This strain is great for rest and relaxation. I have no problem sleeping whenever I smoke it, and it effective against headache pain and nausea as well. Definitely a heavy hitter though; I would avoid using it during the day.”"

JanetA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-dhalia/reviews/1143433,"“My absolute favorite strain so far for my arthritis!  It's like a no pain shawl over my shoulders and neck area.  Within 10 mins, I can get relief from the deep neck pain.   Wonderful body melt.  You simply can't be uptight or in a bad mood with this.  Friendly, enhanced high.  I just LOVE it.

markgarf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-dhalia/reviews/1309697,"“Wow what an interesting strain! When you grind it up it looks like this beautiful reddish purple color. It was a very potent mind racer with a slight body high. Wouldn't recommend for beginners as it induced some paranoia. Overall very high quality and a must try. The effects were distinct from other strains and it just looks gorgeous after grinding.”"

Looks fantastic, smells decent and has a very dark composistion, but the taste is bitter and the head change is very short. Good medicinal qualities such as, nausea relief and pain management. It also is a sleepy flower. No problem crashing.”"

The high lasts for a couple hours, but it never felt like it peaked. The taste leaves something to be desired. I appreciate the very first hit (the green hit). This strain did not seem to have a green hit.  It also made me a bit dizzy.”"
