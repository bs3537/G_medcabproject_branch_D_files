Dankeffect420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1397582,"“Put this on your cereal! This strain will wake up your lungs, for sure. This is a good strain for a laid back day. Great for a walk or relaxing bike ride. Keeps you focused unless you consume too much, then your mind can get a bit "busy"”"
dombovy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1354170,"“If you want to laugh your ass off, i recommend this weed strongly. I smoked 2 bowls of banana diesel and 1 bowl of blueberry and i watched superjail and the tim and eric show on adult swim and i never have laughed so hard in my life. this weed tastes like bananas when exhaling but doesnt smell alot like bananas.”"
karozzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1411002,"“Wow!! Just wow!! If you're suffering from depression, anxiety, a breakup, lost cat, lost remote control for your t.v, if you got the blues then this is the strain for you. A review said this strain is like a cup of coffee in the morning but it's more like having the best coffee you've ever had and waking up to your direct deposit being in your bank account. Banana diesel is just hands down uplifting.”"
biscuit96,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1366786,"“shared a decent sized joint with one friend. took about 10 minutes to start feeling it. i found myself getting distracted from what i was going to do very easily, but at the same time focused on very small things. couldnt stop laughing (i havent found a strain that doesnt make me laugh) over random things. kinda felt like my brain was twitching occasionally, in a good strange way. my friend started talking about how ...”"

orbitingearth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1397583,"“I found the banana diesel to be a welcoming relief from recent strains that had me bogged down. It gives you an intense uplifting high that is perfect for wake and bake sessions. It left me feeling intellectually stimulated and wanting to complete unfinished tasks. Definitely recommend this one even for heavy consumers it will brighten your day indeed!”"
gameon17b,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1373057,"“Good taste, really potent. Had sex in the shower which was amazing. You get pretty horny and talkative when smoking. I kept finding my self repeating what I said, and would lose focus occasionally.”"

Munchiez2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1330467,"“One of the best Diesels ever. Banana taste really surprised me instead of the dominant diesel gym bag taste so that's definitely great, it's smooth and great to run through anything I'm gonna have to try some shatter of this stuff because the buzz is like no other definitely top shelf”"

LeroyBrown420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1243024,"“It's been a long time since one hit of anything made me feel this good but the second toke was pure bliss.  Colorfully dense nuggets with a sweet n sour, skunkish, earthy fuel order that wont wash off your hands. Supper sticky, smelly and potent with a rich hash flavor. Squashing pain and stress, oozing let's get stuff done. I hope Santa brings me more more of this deliciousness, I've been a good boy.”"

senorstrain,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1226558,"“Great not so heavy high , good time waster. Wish I had more I burn through. Smelled a little fruity and did not linger. The  resin taste from the joint was better the smoke itself , flower was sticky and fluffy  , crystals were found through the flower”"

guanope,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1288109,"“Beautifully sticky, this strain was recommended to me because it was "just like a cup of coffee in the morning without the crash". I was skeptical, but it kept me perky and in a good mood to sit through a boring morning meeting at the office, so it lives up to that. I kept a good momentum well after a smoke, definitely recommended for a morning jolt!”"

Magnison,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1314615,"“Tried this for the first time today, well this morning actually. This is a super pungent strain. When I broke open the first bud and buried my nose deep in the trichomes the first thing you notice is the diesel then a sweet after aroma tickles your nose. The high was very nice as well. The way I look at it with my tolerance, is if it gets me high and helps my pain, its a damn good strain.”"
carterkush092,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1323408,"“I really like this bud alot. Beautiful nugs, filled with crystals and a very pungent fruit smell.

Perfect as a morning joint with a good cup of coffee. It gets me clear headed and focused, while keeping me in a great mood for the tasks ahead. Tastes great, with a balanced mellow smoke.”"
yellow_ledbetter,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1148802,"“Nugs: Little sticky and light green in color.

Effects: Great head high, clear focus, and increase in appetite. No heaviness and smooth high through out. Diesel in taste and a bit harsh to smoke.”"
StickyfingahZ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1159865,"“Really good strain, would definitely get this again. I medicated with this and went for a walk, the effects lasted about 2 hours. Pain relief was good and even my anxiety. I was high but focused with what I was doing. I felt comfortable and happy. Talkative and I felt sociable. Super sour diesel is one of my faves and this strain was just as good, more munchies craving with this strain.”"

Alloy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1171619,"“Probably my favorite for when my ADHD/ADD kicks in full-effect. A little bit goes a long way and lasts about 3 hours. I've been really happy with this one from my local dispensary. An almost almond-like aftertaste... toasty. I have noticed that my eyes get a bit more red than usual with this strain, so eye drops closeby will be handy!”"
SamuelArizona,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-diesel/reviews/1181784,"“I liked this. very tasty. Not too heavy hitting like an indica. Very enjoyable and tasted like bananas. Good for daytime use and focusing.”"
