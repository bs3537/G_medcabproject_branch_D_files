The Hog
=============
itsallgravy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hog/reviews/1383658,"“The hog is fire. All these people leaving negative reviews don't know anything. We don't want a review of someones terrible growing abilities. The hog I'm smoking is tested at 29 percent from analytical and is amazing. Tastes of hash, limes, pepper and blue cheese. Great body high. Can feel behind your eyes immediately. Has me feeling couch locked and not even wanting to put my wet clothes in the dryer. Gonna take a ...”"
gypsymadman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hog/reviews/1356150,"“Hog is a very good, classic strain. Quick head change and nice, natural flavor. This has become one of my favorites because it's never disappointing and none of it's effects are too extreme. Only downside is that depending on the environment, it can give you a good case of the giggles, but that's not really a downside, now is it. I highly recommend Hog if you're just looking for a good ol' high.”"

Very good for relaxation and anxiety relief. I was worried about the overbearing couch-lock I have heard about with this strain but I was able to relax without much lethargy.  I'm very fortunate to have been able to get some of this special flower!!!!”"

MaryJane113,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hog/reviews/1351522,"“I grew this strain indoors. Very hairy. Decent yield. High was unique for me. Strong body buzz, with a nice subtle undertone of head high as well. Also, usually Indicas make me want to relax, this did not sway me either way. I actually walked 8 miles to a friend's house because it felt like it was a nice night for a walk.”"

MiguelAEstrada,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hog/reviews/1067157,"“Taste: Has a sweet earthy taste which is very smooth and has no other conflicting flavors. 

Look: Buds are bright green with orange hairs all over. Fairly dense with plump buds. 

High: Mellowing but over powering. Definitely more towards night time because it will knock the wind out of you and make you feel like you need nice deep breathes. Very meditating.”"
