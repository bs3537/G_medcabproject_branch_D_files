MikeOGKush420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/corleone-kush/reviews/1375861,"“VERY potent, high in THC strain. Smells wonderfully delicious, a true OG smell with a kick, very sour lime and pine scent is very obvious. Picked this up right now at URBAN HEALTH in Sylmar on Roxford St and San Fernando Rd.. Lab tested to have THC % of 29. Redicioulous high, very evident indica with a strong sativa head high which is a bit overwhelming even for an experienced medical cannabis aka "stoner" as I; bewa...”"
XanderFrost,https://www.leafly.com/indica/corleone-kush/reviews/1371532,"“My dispensary got this in recently and finally I gave it a try and I wish I had sooner. Potent strain that immediately just eases any pain you have and relaxes you. The buds are covered in delicious crystal goodness. The sample I picked up was around 27% THC so it's up there in potency. Recommend....highly. <( ~ . O)>”"

She talked through treatment, and got the munchies (she was eating during treatment which is unheard of). No headache, no nausea. I don't know why this strain works the best, but the two times we did not take it (tried another strain) she got ill, and had a bad headache and felt like she was go...”"

DaFreshident,https://www.leafly.com/indica/corleone-kush/reviews/1382319,"“Picked this one up on recommendation from the budtender, looking for a good indica strain to ease back tension. Like the other reviews say, there's a definite sativa onset, my head felt like it was filled with sand.  I never spent much time off the couch.  The first hour of the high was happily fuzzy, I spent most of it watching youtube poop because it was just choppy enough to keep my attention.  Slowly my body star...”"
WestAmericans,https://www.leafly.com/indica/corleone-kush/reviews/1371534,"“This strain is my favorite sleepytime indica above all now. It's uplifting in addition to completely relaxing, which is a rare combination. It also knocks you out the entire night. I just wish it wasn't so rare. I know what to do next time it is in stock at least -- buy the Corleones out.”"

Thors_Bud,https://www.leafly.com/indica/corleone-kush/reviews/1601117,"“This strain was recommended to me for sleep. My pain (nerve damage) makes falling and staying asleep difficult. This strain definitely relaxed my body. My mind however, was launched into some crazy loony tunes orbit. I didn't sleep a wink and rode one of the worst roller coaster highs I have ever had. Definitely made my bi-polar symptoms worse.”"

Gorgeous amber sap, sweet and earthy scent with that mouth watering Kushy flavor.  The effects were beautiful very relaxing but stimulating.

 And night time use”"
PhoenixWrathBCG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/corleone-kush/reviews/1721356,"“This strain goes down pretty smooth, with earthy flavors that warm the throat without creating too much coughing. Immediately after smoking, there's a bit of a head buzz it creates, and the full effect sets in about 2-4 minutes later. While it didn't exactly keep me glued to the couch or anything, I did find myself spacing out quite a bit. Overall, it kept me more alert and capable than some other Indica strains that...”"
RStreet,https://www.leafly.com/indica/corleone-kush/reviews/1619802,"“The buds are not as dense as most indicas, but this strain makes up for it in potency and the kief yield in your grinder. In fact, this strain seemed to produce more kief than was possible from the amount of flower in the grinder, and the flower was still potent without having to add any back to a bowl. The effect is a bit sleepy - if you wake and bake, you may end up falling back asleep for a few hours.”"
Nebulosity,https://www.leafly.com/indica/corleone-kush/reviews/1717540,"“This strain has given me a very euphoric relaxing high.  I could imagine having a great nights sleep with this.

CBDizzly,https://www.leafly.com/indica/corleone-kush/reviews/1222529,"“Corleone is one of the most heavily sedating and physically relaxing varieties of Kush I've ever had.

The high is pleasantly heavy, like being under a weighted blanket. It's very zoned-out-while-tuned-in, too. Smoked from the right pipe, it's great.”"

earlofamerica,https://www.leafly.com/indica/corleone-kush/reviews/1269457,"“This strain tastes like hashy fruit and berries. Then it hits you with the cerebral component, which is fairly strong for an indica and makes you feel happy and somewhat focused. Minutes later it spreads out throughout your whole body. The physical high of this will definitely get you, cause couchlock and maybe sleep if you smoke enough.”"
