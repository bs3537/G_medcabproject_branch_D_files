I took a couple of hits and my eyelids immediately started drooping and my whole body just loosened up and relaxed. I may have never felt this relaxed in my life, actually. I’m cool as a cucumber, and I don’t even like cucumbers. Happy, chill, relaxed, and gimme those cookies please. Happy girl. 👌🏽”"

This is so dank, so dark, so nasty and strong I actually wondered if it had begun to rot or spawn into some unearthly fungus here to funkify the planet (picture extremely dark and sugary Concord grapes)...Yet the flavor was always spot on. Proud to say it was not zombies but yet it is killer. I would suggest finding some ASAP it's a...”"

Lately and this could be because I’m more used on it - it has been a good blend. It’s euphoric and happy but also focused on what’s in front of me. Still indica but a blend like it should be. Fast end though not much of a landing. Definitely a nighttime smoke. Gets you sle...”"

Just4Looks,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-cookies/reviews/1709075,"“My friend said this stuff is how "weed is supposed to be." And I couldn't agree more. Such a nice Euphoric strain. A lot of strains get you high and maybe in a better mood, but this shit actually gets you pretty euphoric. It's a nice nighttime strain. Doesn't coach lock and it isn't too heady or anything either. Very balanced and just easy and nice.”"

Lost my appetite for a week from stress, didn't have any bluebs in the house. Picked up this strain, & it has finally got me working out, cooking, and starting to take a few bites. I had a few modest bowls over a few hours and was able to sustain to get through to a nice little drop as I was finishing up cooking. Little bumps of enthusiasm with the bowls. The euphori...”"

Beautiful greens with purple and blue hues running throughout, with lovely orange and yellow hairs, covered with white crystal trichomes. The flavor has a pleasant nutty/blueberry/cookie flavor. The effects were outstanding, very uplifting and can be quite relaxing also. Overall, Blueberry Cookies is an exceptional “co...”"
