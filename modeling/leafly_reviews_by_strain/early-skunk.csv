Qashewnuts,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/early-skunk/reviews/1394423,"“This is a quality potent skunk strain from the Sensi Seed seedbank. A 65/35 % Indica/Sativa hybrid which delivers a smooth, pungently sweet taste and smell and equally smooth effects.”"

Early Skunk smells amazing and can have a short 6/7 week flower to milky trics;)

Low nutrient, mite resistant, I hit everything with Organocide in veg, SM90 if mold appears if too humid. No spray post stretch. A little molasses in final days flush water makes Danky, Stanky, Pacific Northwest bud! Great indoor or polar latitudes with shorter grow season;)

I’m more of a sativa toker, but I really enjoy this strain because It doesn’t make me sleepy, and I swear, the person I got this from has the best weed. The first thing I noticed was the flowery diesel taste as my depression and anxiety melted away as well as give a great body buzz for pain and neuropathy. Very happy and giggly. Great for comedic r...”"

peterpanzerknacker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/early-skunk/reviews/1446134,"“I got 5g of this Strain and in some way it knocked me out.
It kind of prevented me from getting clear thoughts and i was confused about everything and nothing.
I remember playing the Game of Life and i just couldn't pull myself together.
This never happend to me before.

If you get some of this strain I hope you're experience will be a better one.”"
