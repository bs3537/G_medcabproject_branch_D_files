Not recommended for noobs to bud, or if you’re just trying to relax. It only takes me one good hit to have my brain at full alert. Honestly, it’s a bit too potent for my needs most of the time, but I sure do enjoy watching my friends try taking more than a few hits. It usually takes a next level smoker.”"
