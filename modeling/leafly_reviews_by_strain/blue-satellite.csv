Blue Satellite
=============
ChefD,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1388407,"“Starts quickly but levels to a nice overall body high without a lot of the head high.  No extra energy, but does not keep me glued to the couch.”"
nutcase911,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1385553,"“The Blue Satellite #1 is the result of a rare, Blueberry Sativa mother, pollinated by a choice second generation Skb male. This a flexible plant that trains well. The smell is astringent, like cleaning fluid. Very kind! The yield of the mother is below average, but with the Skb influence you can expect to find bigger, more vigourous specimens, as well as the skinny head stash of the mother. The quality is unsurpassed...”"
Jzt,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1385554,"“stress relieving and excellent for relaxing. music is unusually enjoyable. Euphoric and uplifting -very connected and warm feelings towards others. 
cons: dry mouth, lazy”"
totalnv13,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1388408,"“this is a great strain. just picked up and even though it taste very strange it hits you very hard after the first few hits. Expect to get incredibly stoned after smoking this. Very dense nugs”"
juelz06,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1385555,"“I use this strain for my anxiety and to relief from stress. The cerebral effect is definately long lasting but doesn't hurt or make you couch potato.  Daytime strain is the ideal way to smoke Blue Satellite. I smoke it after a long period of studying or to relax during the weekend. I really like the blueberry smell. Really potent too. I don't have the %of THC but I wouldn't be surprise to be between 17-19%”"
PetesBuds,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1385556,"“This strain is quite the getty-up. A couple hits of this and you'll be set for hours. Great for wake and bakes and not so much at night. Your creativeness and overall recognition for life will increase! An odd problem I believe that is linked to this bud is the very large 'coming down' feeling that it gave me. Rare and good Bud.”"
EdibleEm,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1348499,"“This strain is one of those love/hate ones - I love it sometimes but it has a few drawbacks for me. Of course everyone is different. The particular plant I have been medicating with is aquaponically grown. 

I like the high and for me this weed is a bit of a creeper, like it slowly seeps into my headspace. It makes me focused but can also make me carry a bit of tension. Sometimes I am nicely uplifted and refreshed an...”"
Unitizer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1375063,"“I am not normally a fan of sativa, but this strand is so bonkers that I just had to post how much I loved it! When I say "bonkers," I mean energetic, talkative, and pretty much off-my-rocker energy. I cleaned my whole house…AND DID THE DISHES!”"
vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1194075,"“Sticky buds, the inner stems were like wood and had to be removed as I broke up the flowers.  Tasted like berries and honey. 
It was "up", talkative, happy, fun. Not the best for pain, but it took a bit of the edge off and gave me a lift after work for more than an hour an a half. In a fog as I came down. I will be vaping an indica soon for relief, though.”"

TeddyTheCrab,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1301822,"“This strain gives you a really happy, euphoric head high. I felt upbeat while still able to get a more "stoned" thing going. Would definitely recommend”"

chronic.cooking,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1469599,"“Very nice stuff. Long-lasting cerebral effect. Pleasant, happy, chatty, floaty high. Is quite effective on nerve pain, which is impressive for a sativa. I've had indicas that are better, but this stuff does a bang-up job. I will definitely buy this strain again for a daytime pain relief medication.”"

I bought a good amount for a discounted price and I have to say this is great for stress and midday relaxation while still keeping that heady cerebral attention of blue dream. Oh smokes great”"

Appealing smell, Fuel, sweet, Very kind. Helps nausea caused by digestive problems and hand pain from carpel tunnel becomes a little more bearable.

VanIslandCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1314903,"“Blue Satellite has beautifully dense and compact buds with a purple hue that blends in with its yellowish green colours. I love how easy this strain is to smoke, definitely light on the lungs. A very nice high that is almost psychedellic and the comedown feels like an indica. A great overall strain.”"

circlesquare,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1155975,"“just tried this for the first time last night.  right away the smell from the bag was very pleasant. it smoked well in a traditional joint however it needed to be put down occasionally as the conversation began to flare. the strain came from a very reputable grower and is one of the nicest looking strains of sativa I've yet had access to. looking forward to some snowshoeing or music making with this.”"
wassafax,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1229893,"“Well, i can't promise impartiality with this one, for it is truly one of my all-time favorites. Smoked it a couple of years ago and couldn't find it again until very recently. Every time i smoke this particular strain i seem to have  so much fun. Off course you can never attribute all of it to the herb you're smoking, but the uplifting and social -high it provides are a big helping hand for sure! Recommended highly f...”"

StukaFox,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1398445,"“"What the fuck? What the actual fuck?" That's exactly what I thought when I looked at the $5 gram of Blue Satellite that I bought from a nameless dispensary. In the little 

Ziplock bag -- the kind of bag you usually would associate with a dimebag sale, circa 1989 -- were exactly three untrimmed, scraggly, buds, each one a little bigger than my 

thumb nail. The label, which looked like it was printed with someone's ...”"
DrPersico,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1578100,"“This is actually one of my favourite strains. Bought a gram to try it out and the name describes it as it comes, Blue satelite. It feels like you're lost in space but still awake.”"

beachbabe21,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1223767,"“A longtime favorite strain of mine. I love blueberry offspring strains, this one in particular is very euphoric. I think it is more of an indica than a sativa, however. I love sitting down in a hot shower after smoking this strain.”"

Poganman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blue-satellite/reviews/1414968,"“about 3.7 for me. Kind of a creep effect. Once I felt the effects it was very cerebral. I was very uplifted, energetic, and talkative. Preferred day time use. But has a slight relaxing sensation for a bowl after a long day.”"
