Frisian Duck
=============
Teamcanna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-duck/reviews/1327872,"“We love her. She has it all, Smell, Taste, and Yield.... When processed to concentrates, her fruity terpene profile remains with her through and through. Harvesting at 75 days (indoor w/ 30% amber trichomes) will bring out a high, that is uplifting and hits you in the eyes initially, followed by a lasting "stoney" effect, that will have everyone at the sesh sitting silent, deep in thought within a few minutes.”"
mattyweed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-duck/reviews/1472675,"“I grew this outdoor in the UK and man what a beast, 6oz dry yield. Sexy purple buds with a sickly sweet aroma. Easy to grow, mould resistant and smokes great.”"

Big fan of purple buds, which is a plus.
Great hybrid, more towards the sativa side, so it's great for day time use. 
Awesome for stealth growing!”"

Super Beautiful!! It was Easy to germinate! took off like wild fire!!! out of the 4 plants i had going it grew the fastest and had a large harvest in the end I was pleased!! Mine finished on flowering day 72! i gave it a bit longer to mature! It smells so good...”"
SamKid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-duck/reviews/1361831,"“Absolutely 5* for this strain. Really easy to grow, a wonderful energetic, talkative high. Some of the plants  had stronger elements of Purple Star hence the buds were purple and even went very dark blue almost black and some others had the Skunk gene dominant and these were greener and slightly stronger to smoke.  A hybrid but definitely more on the Sativa side.”"
Krollgod,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-duck/reviews/1368800,"“I Loved This Strain!!! Taste Reminded me of drinking Cranberry Juice on the Holidays!!! Not to mention how Gorgeously Purple the Buds where!!! <3 <3 <3
-Note: Not very Potent though! Still Good!!!”"
macqo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-duck/reviews/1314305,"“I always thought that in general cannabis is for 'after hours relaxation' till I met this strain. I was surprise of the focusing effect it gave to me and I have no problems to use it during a day especially in the afternoon when my mind becomes a bit sluggish.”"
irishskunk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-duck/reviews/1351488,"“Really interesting strain; I had two phenos while growing it:
-One looked more like an indica, with small and compact green buds, had a pine taste with some citrus hint.I harvested it with almost no amber thrichome to get less body effects.It's nice in every moment of the day, but beware!Vape/smoke/eat too much of this and you will get couchlocked just as every other indica.
-The other had purple leaves and stems; ta...”"

Crystally, but not the most potent strain ever”"
lowied,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-duck/reviews/1294845,"“really easy to grow! the buds turned really dark purple with green and purple leaves wich made them look just beautiful. The smell was spicy and really fruity, the smoke really smooth and tasted like berries. i had a really nice energetic sativa high and running on my bare feet suddenly felt great. The best strain for stealthy growing cause the leaves are unrecognizable”"
Kifferspritze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-duck/reviews/1610696,"“Habe sie nur Indoor gezogen. Wächst mehr sativa-dominant, aber sehr kräftig mit einem gewaltigen mainbud der bei mir  sogar Indoor noch schön lila wurde. Man kann sie nach 45 Tagen schon ernten, mit guter Wirkung und massig Blüten, die frisianduck hat ihr vollstes Potenzial aber erst nach 65-75 Tagen erreicht, ist zumindest bei meiner duck so, typisch sativa halt. Die Harzdrüsen sind bei der fdk auch sehr fein/klein,...”"

CaptainDickson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/frisian-duck/reviews/1380105,"“The only interesting thing about this plant is the looks. I just hated the effect, the high is almost non-existent, the only thing it does is make your mind go empty and get you tired, no creativity and no energy what so ever. If you really want to waste a few hours of your life smoke this.

I've tasted this strain from two different growers with the same results, definetly NOT recommended.”"
