I'm eating an apple as I write this and the taste is even better than normal. It's so sweet and crunchy! My body pains feel non existent. I can't even recall my typical complains right now lol. If I wanted I could stay up longer but 3 bong bowls have my bed calling my name soon. Will have a nice ride with this strain. Grows big btw be sure...”"

BlitzFury,https://www.leafly.com/indica/money-maker/reviews/1373696,"“Nice thick buds. Smooth earthy flavor. Not the most crystals I've seen. My batch might be 12-18% THC. I got it for $7 a gram in a medical store. It does make you sleepy and couch lock. It's advertised 80% Indica and 20% Sativa hybrid in the store. Smells earthy. It also creeps up on you.”"

SuperTokes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/money-maker/reviews/1210186,"“Very strong indica completely couched us, this was a very euphoric and giggly high, that made us question reality and whether or not we were actually awake or if it was a lucid dream. Not recommended if work or societal interactions are in your near future. Smoke it and watch a movie because that's all your brain will manage.”"

Just like all reefer it makes me appreciate everything more, so everything I ate tasted amazing! I ripped another bowl after and then hit my bed again appreciating how comfortable the bed actually was...”"

Perfect for at home after work chilling on the couch with a movie and plenty of munch. My eyes got super heavy and my mind slowly faded into a daze. Super relaxing and euphoric. I didn't want to move.

The bud smells real good and grinds up nicely. No feelings of paranoia or anxious thoughts. A new favourite for me.

Really stout colas that will require some support so plan ahead.  This strain has allowed me to cut the amount of pain meds I have to take to 1/3 the dosage I had to use before using cannabis-great results.”"
