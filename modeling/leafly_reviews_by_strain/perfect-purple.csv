Perfect Purple
=============
Britter1320,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/perfect-purple/reviews/1669934,"“I just bought this strain from a dispensary in Detroit and it is amazing! Very good heady high that I like a lot. The bud is mainly purple covered in frosty trichomes and it smells like grapes! I'm very impressed. This high feels more sativa leaning, but I'm still feeling a body stone with it. I would buy again.”"
