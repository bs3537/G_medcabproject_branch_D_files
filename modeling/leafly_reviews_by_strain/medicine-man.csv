Definitely one of the most visually appealing strains that I have seen. High is very evenly mixed head and body effects. A mild body buzz but no lethargy or laziness. Very euphoric and uplifted, with no paranoia or stress. Focused and alert, strong desire to listen to music or study. Mild but noticeable headband-like pressur...”"

It tested at 9.64% THC and 8.85% CBD, which to my knowledge is one of the highest thc/cbd ratios. It instantly cured my back pain which had been excruciating. It also gave me a great body buzz, and relaxed muscles. I will certainly be picking up more very soon.”"

It's the first strain that I have ever smoked with a near perfect 1 to 1 ratio of THC to CBD. The particular crop I got from my local dispensary came out with 9% THC and 10% CBD. It's a very mellow, clear-headed and euphoric high. Great for muscle spasms and my Crohn's pain. In heavy doses, I often experience visual and auditory enhan...”"

Very euphoric and uplifting, quick onset (decarbed before smoked) amazing pain relief. Good for strong and chronic pain. I have a higher than average tolerance, this is a really good daytime str...”"
