You delight my senses
Twinkling purple streaks
Amid gold and crystalline embroidery
Your taste - smooth as a river
Flowing from my lips
My lips which relax into a smile
Smiling up at the sun
The sun smiling down on me
Me and my sweet little bowl
of Epic Rainbow Kush”"

I'm a high tolerance person where it's really hard to find strains that work, Rainbow was the first strain that I researched to find out that Rainbow was even better than the reviews. My only problem I have is that the availability since it so hard to find. For myself I have tried Rainbow Kush and it didn't work for me...”"

Would recommend for someone who wants pain management but still have a good head high.

Really good strain!”"

This fruity indica dominant strain leaves your mind in the clouds with your body buzzing on the ground. The smoke for me was pretty harsh but I love the high you get from it. Waves of euphoria that tingles in your toes and fingers make this bud a top 5 bud, if you can get it do it!!”"
