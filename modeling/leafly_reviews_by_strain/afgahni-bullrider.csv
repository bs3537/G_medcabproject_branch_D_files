earthwell,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgahni-bullrider/reviews/1412865,"“Lots of orange hairs is accompanied by light green and yellow buds with a myriad of cream colored crystals.
Excellent smell. A mixture of fruity, sour, and piny scents. Overall reminiscent of a very intense sour smelling candy.
Nice Taste intense mixture of head and body high. Eyelids become heavy and cognitive skills slow. An excellent sedative, analgesic effect.”"

Take a hit of this and write some short stories or make a photo collage.

Feeling very social and interested in everything everyone has to say! All of my friends sounded like they were rapping just by talking! Feeling very distracted and "tipsy" almost (no beer required!)

One of my top sativa's by far!”"
talofa20,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgahni-bullrider/reviews/1369430,"“Very potent strain that I have come to love! It's potent THC levels, along with it's own sweet aroma, and powerful effects on me helps me to actually function on a more peaceful but yet mindful of everything around me.”"
bsonk,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgahni-bullrider/reviews/1416404,"“I got some OK Bullrider, not great. I'm sure this strain is better when properly grown. It's an Indica-dominant hybrid that took me a couple bowls to get where I wanted to be. I got nine grams of littles for free from a trimmer friend, and have smoked bigger buds as well. Not a huge fan- it doesn't have very much character and it's not as potent as a lot of other strains out there.”"
