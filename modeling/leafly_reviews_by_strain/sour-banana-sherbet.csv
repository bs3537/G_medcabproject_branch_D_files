fizzygizzard14,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-banana-sherbet/reviews/1418700,"“This strain is legit MADE for people like me, who suffer sometimes from weed-induced paranoia/anxiety. The high is smooth as hell yet exciting and fast-paced, like a water park slide. Even some nice closed-eye visuals for an added treat. The high is also, and I can say this for few strains I've tried, HIGHLY controllable, meaning if you feel a little too high you can easily put your mind to rest. Best strain I've had...”"

It keeps you focused and motivated but also allows for some well-deserved relaxation upon completion of your task. I personally enjoy it best before mowing the lawn, raking, or other yard work or boring household chores like straightening up, vacuuming, laundry, or dishes. I also like to use it before sitting down to work on a sewing...”"

I found this strain to be great for relaxation and calming of the nerves. Strong. Hazy. A light head high keeps you moving and the fun and stoney body relief is noticable but not hindering. A little bit does go a long way. Moderate lasting high (1-2 hours). A little bit does go a long way, I suspect cons...”"

QueenGanja,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-banana-sherbet/reviews/1468153,"“Sour Banana Sherbet is definitely one of my favorites. The high it gives is very heavy but although it is heavy it doesn't give off a strong sleepy high. Sour Banana Sherb has a really strong gassy smell to it with a hint of the sherb, But when it's smoked the sherb taste is stronger. This strain makes me feel uplifted and relaxed. It is good for anxiety and depression.”"

Ladyopal420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-banana-sherbet/reviews/1547667,"“This strain is an amazing strain for stress and depression. Sweet smelling, covered in crystals, breaks apart to show thick rich nugs. The flavor is surprisingly sweet, and no "resin mouth". While it didn't do much for my pain, it did relieve the stress from my back enough that when paired with a normal OTC I was able to have a good night's rest. Careful with this strain, you may end up being overly talkative.”"

It is a little like being on a roller coaster, that kinda exhilarating feel without the paranoia. It has a kinda fruity taste with a little diesel.

Awesome hybrid strain, one of the best strains I’ve smoked in a long time. Definitely a heavy hitter but still can be productive throughout the day. Don’t often write reviews on strains unless they really stand out to me. If you have a chance I definitely recommend picking up some SBS!”"

This is one of those strains where you stink up a 10 foot radius everywhere you walk unless you put it in a sealed container. Seems to me it is more on the indica side.”"
