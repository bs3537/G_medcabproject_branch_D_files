Hindu Kush

nycyankeesm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1416953,"“Just got this strain and have been smoking it for a few hours, and it's a different kind of indica high for me but I really like it. I have the body high and am completely stoned, feeling uplifted and euphoric but somewhat couch locked. But I'm also getting really weird visuals when I close my eyes. The strangest thing is it makes me really focused and I'm getting some studying done at almost midnight now. I recommen...”"

I have 14 screws and two plates in my leg now and depending on the weather I'm either fine, or grinding my teeth all day trying to ignore the pain.

MellowSailor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1416459,"“As an indica fan, this is my favorite.  It's not easy to find, and it sells out quickly when it shows up, but anyone who enjoys cannabis needs to try this historic strain.  It's a truly pure indica and the seed has been around for hundreds of years.  It's not like most of the hybrids we are all used to - this one is a pure indica, deep and mellow.  In a word it's incredible.

The first time I tried it I felt the ef...”"
Cannabisconsumer98,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1395448,"“Hindu Kush is a definite indica. After I smoked it I immediately wanted to sit down, there is a very strong body high extremely relaxing you. Another good thing about this strain is that you will sleep like never before and wake up feeling happy and refreshed.   My buds were very dense with a very strong pungent smell. I would recommend grinding these nugs to get the best taste and experience out of this strain. HAPP...”"
HealthyMedJuana,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1395447,"“The sweet fruity scent of this strain drives me higher 😁 it has a GREAT taste, the high is AMAZING, RELAXING & Chillaxing...definitely the strain to go for if you just wanna kick off your shoes and relax your feet, Watch a movie, or sit on the beach and watch the sun set 💚💛❤️”"
greengrant,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1395905,"“Phuk i'm baked. I'm riding a rollercoaster of tingles and zings through the 4th dimension, if the 4th dimension was essentially composed of you having a perpetual orgasm whilst sheathed by an extremely dense atmosphere, one much denser than our own. The atmosphere would closely resemble that of Titan's (Saturn's largest moon). If I could describe this high in one word (and I can't) I would describe it as euphorically...”"
unclepappi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1386508,"“I found this strain to give me a heavy, sedated feeling. Definitely great for severe pain, insomnia and stress but would make sure you have nothing to do after you smoke this strain. It is a smooth smoke and an intense indica body high. Would recommend if you need to just chill out and rest.”"
JungleManDan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1386507,"“This is one hell of an indica. The smell and floavor is earthy and dank. Like anywhere I have it I get complaints about it smelling to dank and the smell sticking around. That's what I like to hear! The onset of the high is like any other. It's the after the onset where this strain stands out. First it's normal, then it's holly cow I'm that baked? A definite strain to try if you are into indicas.”"
Joeymogren,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1417905,"“The most relaxing strain I have ever had. Crisp, clean refreshing high. Hardly any head high.”"

I added pics too.”"
AcidBlitz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1370174,"“This is an absolutely fantastic strain. It also is kind of a double use strain. Smoke a medium to large amount of it, and it's incredible for helping insomnia, but smoke a little bit, and it's one of the best strains for helping with depression and stress. I, like many others, often have days where I struggle to even get out of bed because of depression and anxiety, but one hit from my bong of some nice, BC grown Hin...”"
gtsutter,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1415937,"“Best indica strain , that i have ever tried. being an ex heroin addict this is a very good strain to use to wean yourself off opiates and benzodiazepine medications which both have fatal withdrawl effects if been using at high doses over long periods of time.  Recommended for those trying to get clean and dont want to deal with the "life controlling" methadone clinic.”"
pnlcooper,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1326944,"“This strain is one of my favs. I can be high strung and this strain can turn that around very fast, without knocking me on my butt. I am alert, but just very relaxed. Giggly at times and wanting to talk some, but also fine chilling alone. Great strain for me all around meds part of my on hand stock.”"
rancorvalues,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1415935,"“Everyone is different but Hindu for me has more of an uplifting, positive and tranquil feeling than anything else. Eases pain very well. If you have muscle or back pain and want to be productive and positive its perfect. it makes sense that this strain came from spiritual lands. Its blessed by the Gods.”"
perdurabo93,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1415933,"“I have to start this review by stating that I normally don't like pure indicas; too sleepy. I tried a nugget of this at the recommendation of my budtender. I'm really glad I did. It's a nice, mellow high, pain is gone, there's a certain amount of tingliness. I'm real comfortable on the couch, but at the same time have moved from it several times, did some cooking and cleaning. The whole time I'm very relaxed, but not...”"

I just 20 minutes back had 5 hits of this wonderful flower in my bong.  I at first thought i was dealing with a 'all tick no boom' bud.... But maybe into the 3rd hit i found out my mistake. (happy too, not cheep lol)  I would recommend this to anyone who has seriou...”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1415932,"“I always assumed that I did not like indicas -- I like a clear, productive high. However, I found this to be very consistently helpful for writing and ideation. 

The taste is terrible... I thought it was just my batch. 

I noticed that it gave great visuals, while in bed. Very dreamy... 

And not much of a problem in the morning, either.

I had a twinkle in my eye for my wife ;-)  Hashy smell and taste, maybe with a hint of lemon pepper and pine. It was smooth in and out, even the second bag at higher temperatures.”"
wuukiee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1326316,"“One of my favorite all around strains. Excellent for fibromyalga pain, migraines, arthritis, and insomnia.  Woodsy, nearly incense-like smell and taste. Very mellow and relaxing.”"
BJW,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1415934,"“Interesting strain - pretty easy to 'spot' when you've seen it once or twice.  

Dense, balled up nuggets that grow off each other up and down a central stem - tends to look like a natural thai stick ... telltale long thick dark orange hairs with a color hue on the buds ranging from dark olive green to beige/khaki.

2Dfruity,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1186139,"“Very relaxing. Will get you a bit couch locked, great for right before bed. Even though it makes you so sleepy, it doesn't give you that sluggish, foggy feeling in your head like some indicas do. You'll want to sleep, but your mind will still be active and creative. Great for brainstorming ideas, art, writing, and crazy dreams. VERY stinky, not the best flavor. Think like a bitter mix of pine and sandalwood. Definite...”"
curlysgod,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1185927,"“I received a strong version of this bud.  I smoke or vape every few hours usually.  This has a body high effect.  It is best taken if you are planning to lie down or take a ride to a store, safety first.  It is good for body pain and muscle spasms.”"
mamers,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hindu-kush/reviews/1333517,"“Usually a not-so heavy hitter for others, Hindu Kush helps me de-stress and relax when I need it most.    Really helps with mood disorders and those times when you just need to relax”"

This strain of cannabis completely takes all of my pain, anxiety, and stress away within the first five minutes of toking. Normally these effects would only last about four hours, but this Hindu Kush leaves me pain-free and stress-free for about a day.

When I was informed it was available, I practically fell backwards. I had heard of it, but never smoked it. The smell alone is amazing. And this is before the packaging was even opened. I couldn't stop smelling it. It was amazing. Once I opened it, the smell was to die for. I had never realized how amazing...”"

Anyways all I have to say is if you hear of this strain please get it and try it.”"
