Now I am trying this again and it's one of the strains that work for me. I can remember quiet a lot and my action represent all of the keys that I am typing lol XD. By far this is not an over powering strain like ak-47, or GCxSD *GreenCrack x Sour Diesel*. I recommend this for people who have pain, stress, PMS, Mood Disorders, Anorexia ADD/ADHD and Alz...”"

I would say it smells kind of skunky but lemon and tree fruit like. I would highly recommend this for those can't eat, but don't wanted to be medicated all day. I've found that it treats various forms of pain, helps with depression, Mood swings, hypertension, Tinnitus and not to mention anorexia. ...”"

Its smell and bud structure remind me of ship wreck and its a slight euphoric but more of a hungry strain than spacey. Perfect for getting my hunger up, it does kill my depression and my disorders. I haven't been eating much today so more of this tomorrow and we'll see :D. I feel very relaxed a heavy sleepy wave washes over me like a ti...”"

I'm originally from Vancouver BC so I was stoked when I heard my guy had some. Unfortunately the visual aspect isn't as pleasing.... FORTUNATELY the smoke and effect is true to nature.

BouMa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bc-big-bud/reviews/1284513,"“For a sativa-dominant i get more of an indica high. Mellow and happy, but with some burnout. I find it right for the day but had some with some less tolerant smokers and they said it him em pretty hard.”"

solodbv,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bc-big-bud/reviews/1205796,"“With DBV: Wonderfully peppery and citrus in taste, fragrance, and flavor! However, due to how intense this bud can sting the nose, it relieves pressure in your eye and nostril area and leaves you in a cool, indica-fueled calm daze. 

Seriously, this stuff is great and I'm sad that I only have a decent nug left of it... Oh well, but off to another BC strain: Roadkill!”"
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bc-big-bud/reviews/1168343,"“Great for relaxing and calming down after doing a lot of heavy sativas during the day I recommend this for people like me with an appetite and who have mood disorders ADHD, and of course aniexty and focus problems. Love you all this will make you feel like that great for those who need something Euphoric Relaxing a lil bit of dry mouth, happy and creative. I would say its a thin vape all green leaves almost no hairs ...”"

Nice, controllable head high. No added anxiety. No added Paranoia. Good strain to be creative, or to help you get things done around the house. 
I didn't have that ants-In-the-pants feeling but I did have a deep desire to increase my creative output -- for me, this is not a watch Tee Vee on the couch strain.
Vaporized, it had a great earthen taste. A deep loam that does...”"
