CheebaMeeba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sugar-punch/reviews/1332248,"“I grew this strain in soil under a 400W HPS with General Organics nutrients.  The yield of this strain is immense and the smell is out of this world; It has floral notes that intermingle with an intense fruitiness of grapefruit and other flavors in the citrus family.  When ground up, it exudes the same terpines, but at a much higher intensity.  Oddly enough, when I crack open the bottle of ground up herb, I smell mor...”"

BUT! The taste is outstanding! A mix of different berries and much much much sweetness! Cant stop smoking cause you don't want the flavour to fade haha. Just great!”"

biigyellow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sugar-punch/reviews/1185146,"“Interestingly delicious; however, it left me with quite the headache. Take acetaminophen thirty minutes prior to indulgence & prepare yourself for an above-average high and elevated secretion of ghrelin (the neurotransmitter responsible for simulating hunger).”"
g1nj4110,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sugar-punch/reviews/1137672,"“Excellent Strain. The buds are really nice and the smoke is clean and smooth. Gives you that clean and focused high which is great for day time smoking.”"
nailingmonika,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sugar-punch/reviews/1142583,"“Just purchased some from Relief Choices.  Great for daytime use, help for focus, took away my headache and knee pain.  Gave me some giggles, munchies and will be looking forward to experiencing again soon.”"

WeekbyWeek,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sugar-punch/reviews/1242863,"“Got it from The Stud in east of Amsterdam. Dry and crunchy and have a sweet and calming smell. 

The strain is strong, but not too heavy. I got in a creative mood, and think this strain is perfect for creative souls. 

Not for consentrating or listening to others( in a lecture and totally not paying attention). EarlierI felt a bit stressed over school, and stuff I hadn't done yet, but soon got myself to start on stuf...”"

ashighasabird,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sugar-punch/reviews/1313491,"“First thing about it; it looks amazing. Purple and green leaves, covered in crystals. Just so you know, I had blue sugar punch not sugar punch. So, it's sugar punch crossed with blueberry. They didn't have that particular strain on here but anyway, this strain smells sweet.. literally like sweets haha (with a hint of bluberry). Strong taste of lemons immediately as you smoke it. Sweet again and a taste of blueberry. ...”"

flowergirl1982,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sugar-punch/reviews/1254569,"“100% Sativa dominant ... Awesome awesome strain!!! I call it my "miracle motivational  weed " cause it makes me want to all the stuff I don't want to do!! Clean ? Laundry ? No problem.. Just have some sugar punch and you'll actually have a good time. Puts you in a good mood. Also helps with creativity . One of my favorites!”"
suitofgold,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sugar-punch/reviews/1153617,"“Great for a night in by yourself. Nice dreamy effect, especially with some slow or sad music; makes you feel melancholic though. Headache comes when the high wears off. Moderate munchies. 

Body high is pretty heavy when vaped, and you can just fell yourself sinking in the bed when you lie down. Doesn't leave a nasty taste in your mouth.

I love this strain!”"

blazin520,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sugar-punch/reviews/1144531,"“My first time trying this strain, and my husband and I both really did not like it. It increased my anxiety, made my mind race, and makes us feel kind of depressed, not a good high. The bud quality, potency and all is fine, just not a good fit for us.”"
