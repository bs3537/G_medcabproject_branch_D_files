OhYes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/vcdc/reviews/1416047,"“4.5:  A great combination of sativa uplift and CBD relaxation and overall goodness.  I can function fine and it completely eliminates any 'nervousness' that one may be looking to alleviate.  Don't underestimate the low THc's ability to put you on cloud 9.”"
kustom51,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/vcdc/reviews/1189337,"“Favorite strain  !!! Great for pain and anxiety.”"
ElWeedoKid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/vcdc/reviews/1417865,"“This is one of, if not my most, favorite strains. The CBD is very apparent, making it amazing for anxiety and any discomfort in your body. It's also fantastic for nausea.”"
Perki2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/vcdc/reviews/1417849,"“A bit challenging to grow inside as it tripled in height during the stretch, and didn't respond that well to being topped. Good resin production - I extracted 6 cc RSO from 1 oz. The buds tested at 13% THC and 12% CBD (using thin layer chromatography plates). Very effective for my daughter's chronic back pain, without making her feel too out of it. Helps with my irritable bowel and insomnia too.”"
tylerdrew,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/vcdc/reviews/1300897,"“I have tried three CBD strains to date, this strain is by far the strongest, it's exceptional, it's a five. If you like strains that hit you between the eye's this strains for you. I use this strain at night, it makes your body go numb and you will sleep like a baby, it will rival stronger THC strains. To me this strain is a stay at home, late at night, get a good night sleep powerhouse. The strain I tried was 13% cb...”"

rooscruise,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/vcdc/reviews/1417844,"“Honestly... Top two favorite strains (with Canna Tsu aka Fioraleve A in CT MMJ lingo). First purple too!!! Dark berry flavor. 🍇🍠🌳 Easy for me to breathe in (unlike other strains). I vaped the flower, crystals were awesome and was very sticky. Body and mind high, absolutely love. I'm not a big THC fan and am pretty sensitive to it; so this was perfect. Pain ease, was also nauseous before from my immuno suppressants...”"

SOWPERIOR,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/vcdc/reviews/1462161,"“First time smoking cannabis since Jan 2017. First time smoking VCDC or any high CBD strain ever. I have anxiety and panic attacks frequently... first I took 1 baby hit at a time and it didn't do anything mentally.... next time started taking bigger hits, started to get a little head feeling with a mini anxious feeling. Next day started taking 2 big hits and FINALLY I felt pretty high! Normally my heart Beats 1,000,00...”"

Probably best to smoke this one on an empty stomach if you're not trying to put on weight. Not a clear head bud or one I'd smoke before having to do anything that doesn't involve a couch.

I usually use Cannatonic,  but purchased VCDC at the recommendation of one of the employees. I explained to him that I have severe anxiety and he stated that this should work. Well, I had the complete opposite experience. It made me extremely paranoid/anxious/panicked. This may work for some people but for me it was a terrible experience. ...”"
