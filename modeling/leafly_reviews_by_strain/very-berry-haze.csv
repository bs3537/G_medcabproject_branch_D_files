It gives a very euphoric and energetic high, no heavy and drowsy feeling. Good for going out and doing stuff. Tread carefully though, I found I was very easily distracted. 
It did a lot for pain, Within in minutes Arthritis pain in my hands was decreased drastically and my appetite sky rocketed, almost to much, but still great. (not munches, fu...”"

This strain took care of my nausea and got my head in a good place. I was also able to focus on my schoolwork while using this strain.  would wake bake and go work on homework and projects with my team and i could handle the work fine.

Great for focus, movie watching, cleaning to music, sex of every kind!  Great rythym when backed up with God Bud.”"

I'm ganja level with you and say that this bud smelled like straight up diarrhea i kid you not. And it wasn't even unpleasant. I enjoyed it, because I knew what was hitting my nostrils was top shelf, very potent, well grown, a+ quality bud. I would also say that the bud's structure texture were both very aesthetically and practically pleasing. This is not a...”"

honeybum,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/very-berry-haze/reviews/1410718,"“Very mellow, puts you in a good mood. The effects aren't super strong (doesn't make you feel intoxicated) but it makes for a good wake n bake. Helped with mood, nausea, headache and giving me the energy to get out of bed and start my day. Didn't give me any anxiety or paranoia and the dry mouth wasn't that bad. That being said, it wouldn't be my first choice. I prefer a good kick of euphoria.”"

It's given me a strong cerebral high that makes me want to go for a nature walk or see fire works.  I feel happy, euphoric, giggly and still able to do tasks.  It felt decently strong and gave me a big grin.  🍓😁”"

Works amazingly with stress and anxiety which is what I am trying to treat. Please make a cbd  (swiss tsunami) strain so it doesn't hit me so hard.

A marriage of two of the best strains to treat stress and anxiety that we know of. Both with different paths they go about in the brain to accomplish this. They come t...”"

urhighnessxoxo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/very-berry-haze/reviews/1363759,"“I am more of an Indica/Hybrid type of person and the representative at the store that I got this strain from said it was an Indica so I ended purchasing it. Boy was I wrong, the first time I took a hit of it, I loved the taste but it kept me up at night and I can't keep still. This is definitely good for the day time though.”"

The berry flavor is crazy good. 
Perfect for people in pain and for those who suffer from depression.

TheFriendlyViking,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/very-berry-haze/reviews/1295837,"“Very Berry by refine listed as a hybrid I think it leans sativa. THC is 66.58% and it's consistency is sugar wax.

High was a nice energetic euphoric and happy

Smells like poop and crunch berry cereal which was unique to say the least. Taste was a sweet berry with none of the poo smell at all.

Enjoyable dab!”"

Mediocre especially compared to Super Silver Haze in which this is supposedly bred from. Still, decent sativa high, knocked another strain off of the bucket list.”"
Kimb,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/very-berry-haze/reviews/1296713,"“Maybe my tolerance has increased, maybe it's not a great batch but I had to smoke twice my usual test amount and still the effects were very weak and only lasted about half an hour.
