A medium to slow come on that gradually grows in pleasure - like an orgasm in extreme slow motion. You may think that‚Äôs hyperbolic, but the whole body literally radiates with pleasure. This degree of physical feel good-ness, euphoria, and sensory accentuation -all coupled with an impressive ‚Äùgoneness‚Äù catapult this high into the hallucinogenic echelons of LSD.

leahwaz73,https://www.leafly.com/indica/paris-og/reviews/1416444,"‚ÄúI picked up this strain upon recommendation of a budtender for something for insomnia. I'm usually not an indica girl, but they are usually more helpful when i am really desperate for sleep. Two bong hits and the tingly head effects were immediate. The taste was very earthy.

Hawaiiangrower808,https://www.leafly.com/indica/paris-og/reviews/1392470,"‚Äúto me this OG is different from the other OG's, Paris well make you sleepy but really happy and not that hungry. it's a different type of indica it's hard hitting but it keeps you smiling :) 10 / 10  similar to Skywalker OG and SFV OG. (my opinion)‚Äù"
GhostOfJack,https://www.leafly.com/indica/paris-og/reviews/1391861,"‚ÄúGood structure, good color, texture, and gland coverage.  Under 100x Glands are unusually dense in coverage and have overly enlarged trich heads shaped closer to the shape of a mushroom than a sphere.

The shape of the buds is Kush dominant strawberry or tear shaped.  The density o...‚Äù"
Shinehead,https://www.leafly.com/indica/paris-og/reviews/1391677,"‚ÄúThis Strain pleasantly reminds me why I need to smoke more Indica Strains.

911wasaninsidejob911,https://www.leafly.com/indica/paris-og/reviews/1416446,"‚ÄúParis OG is my new favourite Indica. It totally relaxes you, but doesn't knock you out. It's also incredibly smooth to smoke, let alone vape. Paris OG delivers when it comes to pain, yet also has nice cerebral effects. I've visited some really cool dimensions with this stuff! Overall it's a pretty amazing strain and totally worth trying for yourself.‚Äù"

Gabelovesguac,https://www.leafly.com/indica/paris-og/reviews/1503435,"‚ÄúParis OG is a heavy hitting indica-dominant strain. The bud has hints of purple and dark green. The bud is covered in trichomes and has a sweet fruity smell. The effects bring about a long lasting and intense feeling of rest and relaxation. I would recommend this strain to a patient who is looking for a sleep aid that will also work to relax your mind.‚Äù"
h33,https://www.leafly.com/indica/paris-og/reviews/1391675,"‚ÄúSmell and taste are appealing.  From my experience, Paris OG is not as heavy-hitting as you would expect from reading other reviews.  I assume this is due to Paris OG originating from 2 hybrid strands, which I feel also contribute to how uplifting Paris OG feels for an Indica.  I don't ever feel "couched" from Paris OG, but I definitely feel the body high once it takes effect.  Overall, I find Paris OG useful for hel...‚Äù"
