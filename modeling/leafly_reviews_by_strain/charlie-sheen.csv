My head feels like a suspended balloon - distant from my body. My arms look soooo far away as I'm typing!  Super disabling and physically paralyzing. Blissful distraction.

The flavor is a bit stern and mildly bold with a hint of berry or fruit as it shortens (if smoked via joints or blunts). The mental effects...”"

Springy, slightly sticky, dark green nugs, moderate trichrome frosting, quite hairy. This is lemony, tamarind candy dank, with undertones of sweet, compost pile funk. With my asthma, I normally prefer to vape, but I find Charlie to be too harsh after the first two bags, with peppery hot turpenoids reminiscent of wasabi / horseradish. Smoking produces decent tasting if slightly harsh rips, with p...”"

Smell — I will divvy this category up into three pieces. Full flower, grounded up flower, and smoke.

Smoke — The woodland scent profile mellowed but the sweetness became more...”"

alexnstuff,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/charlie-sheen/reviews/1290973,"“Went to my dispensary looking for a bomb hybrid for the weekend and they recommended this. Said it was sativa dominant so I went for it but definitely feeling some of those indica effects. Really nice head rush that leads into a body high. Dank bud, but would not recommend for going out haha. It had me pretty couch locked but in the best way.”"

DabbinMiss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/charlie-sheen/reviews/1142887,"“Wasn't looking for a new indica but I had try this strain. Not your typical heavy hitting indica, starts mellow and gets progressively stronger, and then your asleep. I would recommend this 30 - 60 mins prior to bed to enjoy this gradual night time medicine. Great quality flower from Green Leaf Express!”"

fayewrey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/charlie-sheen/reviews/1282575,"“I have not had true 'Charlie Sheen', however, I did try the grower's choice at AZ Cannabis Society, called, Charlie's Dream.

Due to the OG Kush being introduced to the Blue Dream and Green Crack, it is considered an indica dominant strain.

Disagree with that, but no matter. The taste is over the top and will be your main love, besides the energy high, very motivating type strain!

And ..... hand's down, absolutely ...”"
jaxygyrl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/charlie-sheen/reviews/1343432,"“I love the name, and I think it's totally appropriate. This strain feels like I'm "bi-winning".  To be honest, its not my favorite strain because it speeds me up in ways that aren't always comfortable. Definitely a day-time smoke, and in the right situation -- anything that engages your adrenaline, be it sex, an action movie, or reading -- its magical.

Hope this helps!”"
chuckcabbage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/charlie-sheen/reviews/1245343,"“This strain is nice and relaxing, and will certainly get you high. That said, and I'm not joking here, the residual smoke smells unmistakably of semen. I found this very disconcerting and will be smoking different strains in the future.”"

I have tried many and this one was especially quick for muscle spasm relief. Pain was greatly relieved and I enjoyed the sleepy 2-3 hour sleep come down after smoking especially for a Sunday afternoon.”"
