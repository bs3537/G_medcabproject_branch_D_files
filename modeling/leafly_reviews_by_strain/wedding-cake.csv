A+++!!

It's been a very long time since I've been this high (with a dash of stoned) and it's a fantastic high! 

I picked this up today while I was looking for a new sativa to try. During the day I like to smoke something that will both keep me alert and mentally clear. So far, now 40 min after bong hits (and this is all I've written), and I'm definitely alert and ...”"

With my fiancé, I figured it was only appropriate given the name lol, my fiancé and I gave it a test run. 
Time was moving slower then usual 
More then other strains have done previously.
The best thing of this strain would be the SEX 💦
I've never preformed the way that I did before with any other strain.

So Wedding Cake, also called Pink Cookies, is a familiar taste that I know & love with GSC. The mix with Cherry Pie made the strain a new high. The dessert name does much justice in classifying a general themed taste, sweet! In addition the smell is very strong & pleasant. In terms of the high itself, for ...”"

I wrote about Wedding Cake a few months ago, but I just got a batch of Cake today from SCSA Dispensary, and its so damned good, it's worth noting, and I don't know about you, but each time I smoke a strain, grown by different breeders, they affect me differently.

I get anxious easy when I smoke weed and my adhd usually speeds up that problem.
This is not how I feel when I smoke wedding cake. So far it has been a great help dealing with my stress and feels me feeling light, sparkly, and comfortable.  I ack goofy and “geek”out when I smoke usually.  but this weed makes me feel like I can slow down and articulate my ideas better. 

This isn’t...”"

How I ended up with a random wife, idk.”"
