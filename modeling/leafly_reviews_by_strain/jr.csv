StarlingDarling,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jr/reviews/1370557,"“I Call it Jager like jagermeister. I definitely see why it has that name, It has a pungent pepper and black liquorice smell.

Although i adore this strain i wouldn't pay more than $10 for it. Great for unwinding at the the end of the day. A bit couch-locky.”"

This will sound ridiculous but the taste reminded me of how a janitor mop bucket water with cleanser in it smells. The other thing I didn't like was it gave me intense sinus pressure & a headache. I waited a day & wanted to give it a good second chance, so I tried again. Same thing. This is the first time I've ever gotten a headache from weed & I've be...”"

flipndip187,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jr/reviews/1234128,"“update* This strain has exploded onto the scene recently. All over NJ, but i do belive this is a knockoff version. The batches i have been getting have a strait pine diesel smell, no sweetness to it at all. Although just about everything else seems in line with the description. Maybe they sold a lesser pheno instead of the A-one, still high quality bud.”"

Malachitte,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jr/reviews/1242642,"“This stuff was weird. It also had one of the strongest scents my friends and I have come across. Didn't smell skunky, but obviously still smelled like strong weed.
Helped pretty well for sleep, but I was generally super "foggy" the next day. I don't suggest doing this when you work the next day.”"

This is not a pleasant feeling. I know the worst of this will be over within 30-60 minutes, but I also know that it'll linger until I wake up tomorrow...”"

Seems like AZ has a non Kush version.  I picked up some for 20/8th and it's nice smoke but nothing like the real deal.  Straight licorice reggie. Not even gassy like seeded Durban from Africa. 

So it seems like a lot of the good smoke I know has non-elite versions going around.  It took me years to figure it out but a...”"
