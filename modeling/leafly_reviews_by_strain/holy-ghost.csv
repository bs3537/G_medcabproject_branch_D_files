 almost immediate sativa effect and the indica slowley settles in for a nice blend. Defintly top shelf bud”"
ArtGnosis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/holy-ghost/reviews/1336482,"“1st strain I've tried on my journey to rediscover Cannabis after about 25 years of no use.
Found the strain Uplifting and Mellow, not overwhelming with some mild euphoria. Felt relaxed and a peace with the world, which is not my usual state of mind.
