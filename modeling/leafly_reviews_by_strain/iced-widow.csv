Stevenspowersports,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1396868,"“Got a 1/2 ounce of Top shelf Medical grade Iced widow, a.k.a White Castle. 

The flavors of this strain remind me of Northern lights or a funky Jack Herer clone. very piney, a hint of menthol behind it. This strain STINKS due to the amount of trichomes, stink proof baggies needed, goodwich bags will do the smell no defense
the flavor is something way different from your usual bud, Woody, mentholy, and, to be honest, ...”"

Had just three small puffs from my Haze vape. Relaxed, creative, no anxiety at all, just CHILL. I am a far better Mum and wife when I'm relaxed and better at coping with two screaming, fighting, happy and way too clever toddlers(4,2)!!  I enjoy...”"

Fonsy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1279019,"“Love it. This one is also called White Castle. Very tasty smoke, unique smell and if flushed properly, it will not be harsh smoke at all. I know this strain very well and cannot get enough of it. Thanks Nirvana seeds.”"
ShuswapBlazer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1503110,"“Just picked this up and after looking at the Bud it was a very dense nice colour with lots or orange in it very stinky!  i busted that nug up and took a rip and even the after taste left such a great sweet taste in my mouth i would definitely give this one a go for those looking for a wonderful all around strain it's very tasty!”"
TheHighmay,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1476718,"“surprizing amount of kick in this strain, enjoyable for heavier smokers. Much better than the similar but different strain 'white castle'. Iced widow is more indica where white castle is more sativa dominant. Often mistakenly thought to be the same strain with two different nicknames. Try this one out !”"

SmokeyWomble,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1153738,"“Really nice smoke. Smallish buds with pale orange hairs, covered in crystal. This strain has a serious smell to it. It's a sort of earthy sweetness with a kick of citrus at the end. Really great high. Feel very relaxed and content.  Would recommend.”"

Newbie561,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1237299,"“I'm new to smoking so I am a "light weight" and get high very easily. This strain is my favorite Indica so far because it made my back pain disappear and I felt completely relaxed without feeling like I'm meeting into the couch lol.”"

91Chevy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1636062,"“More frequently labelled as “White Castle” this is actually a pretty balanced hybrid strain, (About 60-40 Indica dominant). Very euphoric strain with a medium body high. Good daytime smoke that simultaneously relaxes you, but also leaves you  fairly energetic and sociable. Not my absolute favourite but a good flower nonetheless.”"

Asurai,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1355886,"“This strain make you super duper extreme mega ultra talkative. unlike other indica, it isn't so heavy but super relaxing so you coud feel that kinda dizzy and very dried mouth due to common effect of weed + talkative(from this strain). super enjoyable in any places but not at office work.”"

borbas,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1343092,"“These buds are covered with a web of crystally orange hairs. When smoked from a pipe, the piney flavor was buttery smooth. Experienced a giggly, psychedelic high that felt more like a Hybrid than an Indica. Had the sensation of having a giant head. Make sure you bring some SNACKS.”"

DukeRaoul,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1458044,"“Sold at my dispensary as White Castle. This is some very tasty bud, kinda has a strawberry jam flavor going on with some hints of vanilla. 

The effects were fairly balanced and not really racy or sedating, just mellow and relaxing. More of an evening smoker if your not planning on going to bed right away, great for watching TV of a movie or just hanging with friends.”"
cctastebuds,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1568637,"“Taste 2.5/2.5
Phenomenal taste. I didn’t get any strawberry, but definitely fruity and tropical. 
Looks 2.0/2.5
Full of orange hair trichomes. The heart of the flower is white and frosty. 
Smell 2.0/2.5
Super fruity and pungent. Doesn’t smell like the typical strain. More similar to a concentrate smell. 
Effects 2.0/2..5
Instant body and stress relief. Small bit of paranoia, but if you’re used to smoking it won’t mak...”"
bluevpfree,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1326508,"“White Castle! A strain is so nice I ordered it twice. This indica dominant lady has nice euphoric and sociable qualities. Awesome for a party because its strong but not debilitating. It put everyone in a great mood. Lots of laughter.”"
laysketchupchips,https://www.leafly.com/indica/iced-widow/reviews/1569182,"“I picked this up as white castle. Very dense and well trimmed. I found it to be an almost citrus aroma with a sweet, earthy taste. It was a medium smoke with a nice relaxing yet uplifting high. I did feel a bit 'hazy', but in a good way. Definitely a hybrid that I'd use for mornings/days.”"

Been cloning with good success for 4+years now and still have one precious bean left. Grown full hydro, in dirt indoors, and outdoors.  Fair yields indoors.  Phenomenal results outdoors. Prefers lower humidity climates.  30 to 40 times the yields. Bugs love it so be sure to treat often.  I used a 3 in 1 treatment that...”"

Crazy to think this strain is essentially the grandchild of 6 different strains as the father Ice strain comes from 4 parents itself, but that’s what it feels like smoking this! You get hit left, right and centre in the brain and body with effects from all sides of this strains heritage coming through. Definitel...”"
