Flo
=============
toadondrums,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/flo/reviews/1419007,"‚ÄúI've suffered from a seizure disorder for about ten years now. About a year ago, I stopped taking the pills they were feeding me and got my Medical Marihuana Card. The majority of the cannabis that I've smoked since I quit taking pills and picked up the pipe has been Flo. It's been a year and I haven't had a seizure yet.‚Äù"
warpedcassette,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/flo/reviews/1416851,"‚ÄúI really enjoy Flo. Being a Sativa-head, I find myself naturally inclined to select Sativa, or Sativa-dominant, strains. I ended up picking Flo by accident since the dispensary was out of Bruce Banner, my original selection. Flo didn't let me down.

In flower form, this strain smells like candy. It's the sweetest smelling strain I've come across - so sweet, you'd think the trichomes were actually grannules of sugar. ...‚Äù"

Pharmakon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/flo/reviews/1414353,"‚ÄúA lucid, happy high unlike I've ever experienced before.

The high was strong but not overwhelming. It didn't cloud or even slow my thoughts but energized them and granted them a clarity I would otherwise have to put more effort into to attain. Sort of like a calmer but just as energizing adderall high.

I became sociable, elated yet relaxed and toward the middle of my high, introspective. I was completely functional during the day. The strain also assisted me in relieving chronic pain in my shoulder.  Personally had a wonderful time sans paranoia or tingly body high which I'm not fond of at all. 

If you're looking for a well balanced high, go with Flo.‚Äù"

The taste is pleasant and I don't get any appetite stimulation,  which is also a necessary requirement.‚Äù"

WestAmericans,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/flo/reviews/1166770,"‚ÄúPretty nice. Felt like an energy-inducer, but with a good amount of euphoria. Very little lower body effect.

I felt euphoric and happy. Very talkative. Great for having deep conversation.
