StarBud
=============
zipy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1388861,"“This is one of the most powerful indicas I have smoked. My husband, sister-in-law, and myself think that this is the hard hitter out of all the strains we smoked. This is always a knock-out punch, leaving you flat on your ass. This is the type that will leave your ass on the couch and you are thinking "Why the hell is my body and head so heavy?! Am I turning into a rock? Why is gravity so strong?!" If you have issues...”"
FrenchKush,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1381120,"“Thick and compact buds, dark green. Pungent and skunky smell, the smoke is heavy. VERY strong strain, the high is overwhelmingly powerful, the first time I smoked this strain alone, I was embedded in the couch, having auditory hallucinations. Not a weed you want to try if you have to achieve something during the next 3 hours.
Definitely the most potent and long-lasting I've encountered.”"
MindRite,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1373288,"“This is a connoisseur's Cannabis, not unlike a fine alcohol to drink from a snifter.  Take your time, experience the smells, tastes, and feel of this high-class, heavy-hitting flower.  It's time to sit for a bit at the end of the day, and melt those pains, strains, and worries away.  Get together with some buds, put on some records, and enjoy one of the finest strains of ganja on the planet.”"
EugenesFinest,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1373286,"“This is some serious fire.  I'm a seasoned smoker and got my hands on this stuff and it knocked me on my ass.  Most potent stuff I've smoked in awhile for sure!”"
PFirefly1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1373287,"“I suffer from Crohn's diseae. I have tried many different types of this magnificent plant. NONR gave me the complete ease of pain and healing qualities as did Star Bud. The 2 closest were Querkle and Hashbery. I am very grateful that I can order the exact medicine I need without wasting money for an unknown effect. Thank God for this strain.”"
surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1317854,"“Another super bud, similar to Death Star this strain offers a dank, twisted chemical scent followed by a sweet kick, tastes thickly of deisel. Dense, compact, pungent buds. Stank up my whole zone. 

Nausea gone 
headache gone 
stress gone 
mood elevated 
dreams colorful

PDXRev,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1221109,"“My oh my! StarBud is a knockout. I was lucky enough to pick up some flowers from Greenland dispensary in Portland, and it is my new hands down favorite. 

The taste and smell are not its strengths, but it is a beauty to look at. It smokes very smooth, but not a lot of spice or zing to it. But Holy Geez, it has a wonderful quick high. Very relaxing, nice and calm. But it does come on pretty quick. 

If you get a chanc...”"
weednerd7450,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1492874,"“This strain is very narcotic like, A deep relaxing body stone that left me attached to the couch. Starbud's bud structure is very dense with a darker green appearance. Tasted earthy and sweet! As a budtender I highly recommend this for pain and insomnia.”"
stonedsteg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1230449,"“A very strong and heavy indica smoke, great to relax as the couch lock is immense. Very pleased with the rare pepper undertones and the strains medical ability to eliminate pain.”"

HighSaberTooth,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1604025,"“I opened this up and The smell hit ya nicely. Light it up and good lord, you are out there. You feel an amazing, very smooth, gradual high. Once your done smoking you aren’t at your highest yet. That happens later. And you just feel euphoric, your dizzy and happy all at once. I love it, great for wake and bake because you can still be functional after you smoke.”"
ultrapop,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1260648,"“I would love to award this one five stars but it's just not there, it's close but seems to fall short. I love exploring the indy world and this one seemed appealing. Don't get me wrong it's a nice flower, the taste is a bit on the earthy side and the head is relaxing but for indicas i prefer more heavy hitting strains! Hence where it falls short in my book. For the beginner smoker venturing into indic a land, a good ...”"
420Pete,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1282667,"“Been growing this strain from Hortilab for a few years now.

Always super chemical tasting and pungent, best smoke around imho.

In taste.”"
Papirius,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1373000,"“A really amazing strain with strong mental effects for an indica, it cheers you up like Red Dragon and numb your body in a very pleasant way. The taste is also quite unique and really worth a try.”"

Hazesfordays,https://www.leafly.com/indica/starbud/reviews/1499028,"“The effects were mostly very nice and it was a tasty smoke. Good calming, detail oriented effect for low energy chores.

It's smooth and peaceful but make no mistake ... this is a "I wanna go lights out" strain. 

Not for beginners and may not be for anyone who wants to stay remotely active but man is this top shelf stuff and certainly something any indica fan should try.”"
