First time I hit it, I started giggling my way down the street so bad that everyone was looking at me like I was zebra striped.  It wasn't me just being paranoid either, this strain had a great relaxation effect and an uplifting cerebral effect which actually made me focus better.  Especial...”"
HybridDragon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/thai-girl/reviews/1392325,"“First off,I didn't find anything surprising about this strain as far as taste goes.Just regular herb smoke but it was resinous enough that it put out my joint a few times before I was able to finish it.Which I like usually but you may want to let it dry for a couple of days first for a better burn.Now to the review...this stuff is great!Have always preferred sativas over indicas anyways the high was racy like a sativ...”"

JerrySprunger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/thai-girl/reviews/1321122,"“Very unique strain, for a sativa this flower was very chunky and sticky almost like an indica dominant, lime green, with orange-yellow hairs heavy trichome glands. Resembles the profile of Dutch treats just not as of discntive scent. My first hit out the bong send a happy tingly sensation throughout my jaw to begin a euphoric heady high. cool high that gives a body high like an indica strain. smooth smoke.”"
nanis2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/thai-girl/reviews/1353594,"“This is a good strain to use if you want to think everything is beautiful and dig deep into all the ways life is a gift. Euphoria! Thoughts are going a mile a minute and digging deep into concepts. Hard to finish a task because I keep starting new ones. But starting a lot of 'em. Hard to focus because everything is fascinating... Good for the heart :)”"

Sean420guy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/thai-girl/reviews/1310276,"“tight little nugs, burns very well while providing a relaxed but alert with slight head buzz. this would be a great summer time loungin on the beach weed!”"
jlmurphy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/thai-girl/reviews/1471685,"“Got me really high AND very anxious. Do not recommend smoking this and watching horror movies. Otherwise, pretty decent strain.”"
naturallyjass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/thai-girl/reviews/1316357,"“Thai Girl personally doesn't get me as high as I would like before a work out. I can't quite concentrate through the pain as other strains. However, it does put me in a good mood for a long time and it tastes great. It has a fruity taste like mango. It's nice right before work, helps me interact better with customers.”"
WhiteLioness,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/thai-girl/reviews/1319791,"“I have severe pelvic coagulation and usually go toward indicas for the full
body relaxation and pain control. But when my budtender told me about this strain for her back pain and after getting some oil, this is my #1 sativa. It's not as cerebral or halo as others, but more full body with an energetic, bright feeling like I just took an amazing shot of espresso. Exercising and hiking with this in an oil vape is an ab...”"
rando1832,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/thai-girl/reviews/1461953,"“It has a bit of a pleasant head high but it also makes me anxious and uncomfortable. I'm not one to normally get anxiety from cannabis.”"
the.legend,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/thai-girl/reviews/1479629,"“I mostly enjoy this strain, it tends to be kinda racy and energetic, good for being social and getting things done. Over time, it's become less special to me, but still a good go-to for those qualities.”"
