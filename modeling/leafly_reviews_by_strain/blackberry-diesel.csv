With a crisp texture, dried well it makes for great rolling big or small and burns with ease.”"

Wonderful balance of sativa and indica characteristics.”"

TheAfterMath41,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blackberry-diesel/reviews/1283770,"“Me personally,I was not a big fan of this strain. The taste was good but, the very heavy side affect of being anxious gave me a panic attack. I have friends with this same problem as me where I get panic attacks or anxiety attacks from strains with high negatives in; paranoia and anxious that it is really hard to enjoy the high. Good strain but just not for me”"
