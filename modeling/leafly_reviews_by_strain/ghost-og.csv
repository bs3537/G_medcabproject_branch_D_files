Ghost OG
=============
SonTarble,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1410766,"‚ÄúThe Ghost OG Marijuana strain is an Afghani hybrid strain. It has good balance between the traits of Indica and Sativa. The Ghost OG strain has won many awards and is know for being potent, but not so much that it will wreck your day. Also known for its solid body high and good euphoric effects. The Ghost OG strain smells fruity, and is great for treating pain, helping people sleep, and anxiety.‚Äù"
PackDUHBowl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1399060,"‚ÄúThis strain is very reminiscent in the looks of OG Kush, perhaps more tight buds. Smells a little more earthy and is a lighter smoke than OG Kush. I suffer from bipolar depression and anxiety and can say it certainly calms me down. I do not suffer from any chronic pain but I can tell that the relaxing body effects would probably be very helpful with pain. Great relaxing strain!‚Äù"
LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1411832,"‚ÄúBoy oh boy, Ghost OG is a very potent OG! Actually thought I was a damn Ghost for a minute lol!  Definitely indica dominant, helps a lot with Pain, Anxiety, Depression & Insomnia! Definitely give this one a shot if you come across it!‚Äù"
redbull2002,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1394156,"‚ÄúThis one surprised me because it's not much in the looks or smell department. The bud tender told me the looks were decieving though and the Ghost delivers!

In general its kind of trancey and stoney in a satisfying way. Sound is enhanced so music is really affective, it cuts through any distractions, like I was really jumpy when I listeend to jumpy music and when i listened to weird slightly eerie music, I was taken...‚Äù"

I have an extremely high tolerance and it usually takes using good bit in one smoke session. Every single strain I was warned about its potency and to be cautious bc it's a creeper.

I have been in soooo much pain and nothing seems to be helping me at all except for this strain!! A few hits and it‚Äôs as if my entire body is finally able to relax. It definitely reduces the pain enough for me to get some sleep as well...‚Äù"
NG2.Yoka,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1416009,"‚ÄúBought a half 1/8 first but then I had to go back for a 1/4. It has that strong kush taste that everyone loves and the instant high that will let you know that you're smokin' on some bomb! 3 bowls of Ghost OG was enough to get me goin; I began to experience the strain journey. I felt relaxed, in a good mood, and overall happy. Its the kind of high that I like for wake n'bake. I would buy this strain again, definitely...‚Äù"
Deitab,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1391097,"‚ÄúGhost OG is an amazing strain!  Perfect blend between indica/sativa.  More indica though which I like.  Going in my top 10 if not my top 3!‚Äù"
epad123,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1394112,"‚ÄúIt's a very user-friendly strain. The calming and relieving effects are felt throughout the body and the head, but they are not too strong. Nice smell, clean taste, and not harsh on the lungs.‚Äù"
LRS,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1416011,"‚ÄúHave yet to smoke this stuff, but I've been vaping it the past week and all I can say is WOW.  This strain has every good quality I look for in cannabis: It dosen't put you to sleep, it gives you both a head high and a body high, gives me great creativity, amazingly relaxing, and you can still focus and go about day to day tasks.

Cool name too.‚Äù"
Miketherealest420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1417300,"‚ÄúGhost OG has seen a revival in the medical industry, particularly on the east coast. This strain posses thick fluffy buds that, when cured correctly, posses a combination of milky white trichomes and sunburnt accents all along its' dense body.

It's very tasty I'm getting a lot of gummy worm flavors. 
The smell is very relaxing.
The high is very chill, everything is brighter, light haze, but very focused.‚Äù"
cretin71,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1396991,"‚ÄúA perfect hybrid. The flavor is straight OG: lemon, pine and earthy sweetness. The head high comes on hard and fast, followed by a strong body high about 10 minutes later. I love this smoke in the evening, because I can enjoy the combination until I'm
ready to sleep without being forced to sleep. That said, when I want to conk out for the night, sleep comes easy.‚Äù"
Ghoast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1385119,"‚ÄúGreat strain, got this one from quality medical collective in Chino, CA.

Boneman236,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1392036,"‚ÄúThis has to be my favorite hybrid OG! Great relaxed feeling but not sleepy. Has a good sense of euphoria as well.‚Äù"
fakeford,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1388123,"‚ÄúMy favorite strain so far. Incredibly calming and relaxing without locking me into the couch or putting me to sleep (unless I smoke enough). I can still be physically active and mentally engaged after smoking Ghost, without a trace of ruminative thought patterns or fixations or anxiety like I experience with some other strains. Definitely one of my go-to strains.‚Äù"
wrigsmc,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1396989,"‚ÄúTook a couple dabs of this and was lifted to the max. It felt like I was a just a kid again getting super high with my friends. Definitely not for rookie smokers. I tripped actual ball sack‚Äù"

EarthboundMisfit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1391099,"‚ÄúVery frost covered bud with a funky Kush-like smoke. Not a lazy buzz, more alert and uplifting. Worked well for pain and arthritis. Fine strain.. 5/5 would buy again.‚Äù"

kushplantwizzard77,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1259933,"‚Äúpeople talk about weed being good, but this stuff is different. the batch I have is only 18% thc and smokes better than strains I've seen at 27%. the buds are a super frosty bright green, and the smell is super pungent. the high is unique as far as I know, and starts really heady and tippy and then mellows out to a silly goofy high the more you smoke. I've seen many good strains, but this is "the one".‚Äù"

Snipps67,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-og/reviews/1781201,"‚ÄúThe flavor of this strain is phenomenal. I've been vaping a cartridge of it and it takes like sweet lemony citrus and vanilla.
