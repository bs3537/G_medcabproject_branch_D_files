From buymyweedonline.ca       Buds are super swollen with bright crystals and hints of color purple.  Very sticky with aromatic aromas make it an all out pleasure to work with and smoke.  Def worth the price ($260/OZ).  High is intense with no couch lock feeling.  This one is one of my Favorites!”"

liam5x,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ghost-bubba/reviews/1572936,"“I picked up this strain at my local dispensary as the budtender said it was one I wouldn't want to pass up (I was looking for a hybrid that wouldn't bring in any paranoia or anxiety. This strain is an extremely well balanced hybrid, with an initial uplifting happy high followed by a more dominant calming indica stoning effect but not so much that you it knocks productivity. This strain could be used day or night.”"
