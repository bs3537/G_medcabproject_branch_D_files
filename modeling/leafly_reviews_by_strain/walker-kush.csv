greengoddess413,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1361938,"“Walker Kush gave me a very nice relaxed and pleasurable mind and body high without being too sedating or heavy. Really enjoyed this one and found very effective for stress, PTSD, anxiety.”"
RC617,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1390842,"“I love my Indicas especially before bed, and this strain is putting me to sleep as we speak. Amazing for insomnia, I picked up some shatter and it's got an amazing taste/smell(shoutout NETA!) not too rough on the inhale or exhale, it's extremely smooth. With a fantastic blend of mind and body relaxation. Can't wait to try the flower next time it's on the menu! Definitely one of my favorite concentrates so far.”"
novicetoker81,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1392858,"“Whoa. Two tips I'm high. I haven't felt like this since I tried Pineapple Express. Pain gone,stress is dead.  I'm really enjoying my high from this strain”"
lgibson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1389054,"“This is my favorite strain for my anxiety, PTSD, and insomnia. It slows my racing thoughts, gives me a peaceful mind, and lulls me to sleep. From a true medical standpoint, I haven't found a better strain to treat my conditions.

This strain gives me a stressfree high without the munchies, dry mouth, and other side effects I normally get. Since I started using it, I find myself less anxious overall, even when I'm not...”"
daisies4u83,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1369518,"“One of my go to strains. Really helps to relieve stress. Not a super strong strain that will put you out, but it's relaxing qualities will definitely help you sleep if that's what you need. Can stimulate appetite.”"
DeviBliss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1369517,"“This strain made me very relaxed, spacey and drew me inward. I found myself deep in thought. Not a social strain, but good for a solitary, creative setting.”"

catling,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1358275,"“A few puffs of this and suddenly my feet aren't killing me anymore. Slightly uplifted mood. Pretty good all day strain. Cuts my anxiety and makes me feel more positive without a really high feeling (low doses). Wish it tasted better--I'm not a fan of the sour/cheese aftertaste.”"

JorgeG62,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1391429,"“A solid indica lean that's OK for daytime use and even workable, not overpowering, long lasting, enough happy sativa overtones to allow conversation, good pain relief for a slightly lower potency, bright green and orange, pillowy cones, nicely trimmed, piney earthy some citrus and wood, very nice from NETA.”"

Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1453846,"“Very Dank, and super fluffy these have huge amounts of trichromes all over these rounded boulder nuggets. The Look: A complex pattern of red orange hairs covering more of the bud than these dark sage looking leafs. The frostiness flakes off when breaking them off into the grinder cured to perfection to wet and not dry a mix in between.
The Smell: A light of the chemdawg is definitely in here I can totally smell the a...”"
LoonaMoth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1774553,"“Absolutely amazing for turning down racing thoughts, manic behavior and insomnia. This is definitely a heavy hitter for me. Not a great many strains control my muscle pain like this one does.”"
Mr.Widow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1702668,"“How has nobody reviewed this strain in 8 months WTF ? This shit is definatly a strain to keep in the head stash. With Genetics like Ghost, Chem, Triangle and friggin Albert Walker, which was fire already, it makes since why this is one of rare dankness' calling cards. In the MA. Area this is well respected and obviously its a strain that came to the east later than west, but we know good bud over here too! Its got a ...”"
Dahlia_Llama,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1773442,"“I was more than pleased with the high this strain gave me. I picked this out for a chill after-work hangout & gaming night with a couple of friends. We started feeling it after the first hit! Eventually we were very relaxed and comfortable on the couch. I loved this strain because it definitely made me super giggly and uplifted, but it didn't give the typical space cadet zone outs, memory issues or anything like that...”"

blajanfire,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1374068,"“This stuff is great! Good body high. I feel like a good walking zombie on it. Great for insomnia. It will put you to sleep at the end of your high. One of my favorites. :)”"
3eyedbluecheese,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1370767,"“My all time favorite. So relaxing, but doesn't knock you out yet if you get into bed you have no problem falling asleep. Doesn't give you couch-lock either, but I'm not saying that if you sit/lay down you won't feel so comfortable that you'll never want to leave.
 Great for stomach pain/nausea. AMAZING for anxiety and panic attacks (and probably PTSD). It doesn't make you stupid or foggy-headed. It's actually a reall...”"

nicnac7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1308231,"“This is my daytime go-to. If I feel a panic attack creeping on, I can take two or three puffs from my vape and I find myself grounded, clear, calm, and much more cheerful. It also doesn't relax me too much and doesn't cause drowsiness with light use - I work about 60 hours a week and am a complete insomniac so I need to remain alert. It is my life-saver. Bonus: yummy!”"
ThisOneTimeAtUmass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1334705,"“Might be my new favorite strain for morning/daytime use. Pretty much the best of all worlds. Solid heady euphoric high that sets in very quickly and stays both tight and mellow for quite a long while. Adds lots of the indica style body buzz and muscle relaxation without any real tendency towards laziness or sleepiness. Also brings with it an increase in appetite and solid pain relief, in my case related specifically ...”"
jaibhavaya,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1333773,"“This was the perfect balance of mellow and clear.  Very modest in smell and taste, with a very comfortable high.  Approachable for beginners I would say, but still a treat for more experienced smokers.”"
uberginger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1794441,"“I really enjoy this strain which I consumed in my Ascent vaporizer at 380 degrees - very relaxed high - calming ...I don’t feel sleepy but definitely not energetic either. I have a nice head buzz.  Honestly to me not a Particularly remarkable flavor but that’s not what I’m looking for in cannabis flower.  I would definitely purchase this again. So glad to have legal cannabis in Massachusetts!”"
herashr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1355817,"“The Strain has been very effective for all my symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks. It leaves me calm but clear. The one downside is I sometimes I'm left with a dull headache. #420sweepstakes”"
Matty_Kushmaster,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1794531,"“I have PTSD and this strain is giving me my life back. I haven't felt this good in a decade. Best weed I've ever had.”"
dualhammers,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walker-kush/reviews/1742609,"“Not a good strain for me. I find certain strains cause acute anxiety effects and this one was bad in large doses. 

A hit or two provided a light head and body, but when I consumed a full oven from my Magic Flight Launch Box it was difficult to stand without feeling dizzy. Going for a walk I felt deep fatigue which increased my anxiety.

Not a strain for going out and doing things unless you want to spend that time p...”"
