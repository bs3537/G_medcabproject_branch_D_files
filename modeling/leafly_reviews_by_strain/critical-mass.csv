I have really been struggling with chronic insomnia; 6/7 days at a time with no sleep.

allinlinden,https://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-mass/reviews/1209679,"‚ÄúGood pain relieving strain! Usually close to 1:1 THC to CBD! Mellow head high and good body effects. It's usually around 8-12% THC and 10-15% CBD and has a mild Indica type high with a little sleepiness but not to couch locky. I like it at anytime of day for pain relief. Good medical strain!‚Äù"

It is horrible- wracking coughs that go on for about 10 minutes a hit, no matter how small the hit. I hate it! I've been a daily smoker for a very long time and I recognize that the buds are good- no mildew going on or anything. Wtf?!‚Äù"
