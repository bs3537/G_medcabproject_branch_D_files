This instantly became a top 3 strain I’ve ever smoked. Have just tried flower personally but this is a nice heavy indica. I do find it harder to work the first hour after smoking but then I get in a zone and work better. So I would not recommend smoking this one while u w...”"

I believe more that it is a cross of The Light of Jah & Afgoo as it taste exactly like Jack yet has a bit more of a relaxing effect. It's great for all around use.

Personally I smoke it by itself in the day, I add CBD hash when I need a more energetic bowl, and hash when I need to knock out. If I could I would definitely make this one...”"

Mamasmokes76,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jah-goo/reviews/1610715,"“Jah goo is a good indica. It has a strong smell and is very calming. While I was relaxed I didn't feel tired. I felt more relaxed breathing & a bit of a tingly body high. Jah goo made my eyes and eyelids "stoney" feeling....yay!”"
TheMidnightRider,https://www.leafly.com/indica/jah-goo/reviews/1791814,"“JahGoo is one of my top 3 favorite strains. The best to come out of the Mendocino County mountains. It’s a cross between Jasmin and Pink Cadillac Goo. It is a hybrid that creates a very balanced high. Grown above 3,000ft elevation, JahGoo grows in full sun above the fog line; Certified organically grown outdoors fed with fresh spring water from the mountains, this is a fruity smelling, dense, frosty, bud structure st...”"

, relaxed body high with some fun cerebral euphoria. def 8/10 high for me though 😁”"

One hit and I knew this was a Hybrid, 50/50 I'd say, gave me the jitters and a sativa headache. I'm not saying its a bad weed, nice heavy dense buds, great taste and flavor, but I just can't smoke Sativa or Hybrid without getting a headache. You guys we...”"
