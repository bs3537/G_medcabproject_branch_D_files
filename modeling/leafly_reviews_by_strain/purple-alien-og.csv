=============
courtkush424,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-alien-og/reviews/1379947,"“Wow. For someone who prefers a sativa, Purple Alien OG is one of my all time favorite strains. A couple hits of this heavy hitter will leave you feeling so relaxed and at ease. Depending on what I am doing I can either get major couch lock or be just fine being active. The key is it amplifies whatever you were all ready doing. So sitting on the couch smoking a bowl of PAO and you'll be stuck there all night. Smoking ...”"

I probably should have smoked this stuff in bed because the walk from the back yard to my bed was more like a trial on Ninja Warrior.  Smooth smoke via J or via water pipe.  Tasted amazing with slivers from all parts of its parental lineage with the citrus rounding off the flavor.  If you see this strain, TRY IT unl...”"
