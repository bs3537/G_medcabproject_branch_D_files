Quite seriously and literally with everything. With my boyfriend, with my dog, with the weed I just smoked, with this peanut butter and banana sandwich I'm eating (holy crap I am IN LOVE with this sandwich!)... I feel so positive, like nothing could ever bring me down again, and I think I've declared this strain "m...”"
IndecisiveMrIndica,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1415994,"“Big fan of the CBD strains (typically indica) so I thought I'd try this for a change.  Picked up the Moani Naturals 7.29 thc 12.22 cbd.  Def no mental fog at all and or paranoia(usually sativa strains don't agree with me at all).  Good balance between mind/body and certainly does help with chronic back pain.  Makes me feel motivated to take on a large task.  
Buds smell absolutely delicious with very sweet yet delica...”"
iggy18,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1370502,"“This is one of my favorite strains. I've never been uncomfortably high after smoking this, Which is something I'm always cautious of. I'd recommend it for new smokers and lightweights like myself. It's a very clear and light high, so you can remain active and functional. I think my favorite thing about this strain is that it just puts me in a great mood. I wouldn't call it euphoric... it makes you feel like you're ha...”"
soccermom,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1363517,"“This strain is perfect for the soccer mom or professional on the go.  Relaxes your body, eases pain (amazingly well), and gives your spirit a slight lift.   Very nice!”"
toolbelt_1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1369009,"“This has to be the best strain ever!  It just makes you feel relaxed, warm, comfortable and quiets your mind!  I don't get that paranoid feeling or bad feeling like I have done something wrong like I did with other strains.  It just makes you feel good, period!  The reason I started smoking flower again was because of chronic pain and I can attest this strain is great for pain.  The lower THC content and higher CBD c...”"

Wow, is all I can say. I have chronic pain and this literally numbs it away. I tried it today for the first time by itself (I was mixing it with other stuff before) and I thought it would not get me stoned. I was wrong. The version I got in the form of a joint is from Moani Farms in Seattl...”"
JGNoll,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1352154,"“My daily aches and pains strain.  10+ years of construction work has left me with a worn out achy body.  With a little help from Hawaiian Dream I'm ready for the next 10.  Incredible taste and smell, like a fruity tropical cocktail with a splash of piney gin.  The high CBD (11.52) and low THC (3.83) eases away the pain and leaves for clear headed and energized.  Very enjoyable.”"
AnxietyQueen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1370503,"“This strain doesn't make your heart race like most sativa. If I have a class where I know I can't afford to deal with social anxiety this is a good go to. Productivity is good with this!”"
victoriauhl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1363452,"“Not sure if I encountered a weird batch of this or what, but I could not disagree more with reviews here. Came on way too fast + heady, could literally feel the "happiness" chemicals in my body / mind being forced to participate. Very synthetic feeling. 

From some notes I made during:

"I guess if you're a way experienced user and looking for this kind of high, you'll appreciate the melty / trippy / bloodrush vibes....”"
badangel00013,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1363450,"“This is a perfect low thc good daytime smoke that will get you through meetings, work and interviews. It had a good cbd to thc ratio and if you are like me sometimes you don't need something so strong to cripple you. This is where this comes in, beautifully smelling but the taste is like dick,  not a nice taste at all. But hey it's a good beginner weed for daytime function, helped my anxiety and focus but if your loo...”"
OminousWeasel,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1279943,"“One of my favorite strains. Extremely high in CBD which was amazing for any type of pain. Still got a decent buzz from it and maintained focus.”"
mickfromkent,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1394049,"“Probably had too much, basically a whole joint.  My HD tested at 4.6% thca; 14.6% CBD from Moani Farms in Seattle. First experience with HD was virtually nothing on a couple 3 hits so this time I figured I needed to smoke a lot.

I'm positive I've never had this much CBD ever before.  The high with it was OK but not fun. almost like if you're drunk at a party after having too many drinks and trying hard to sober up. ...”"
Logan777,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1689851,"“This strain is sweet! I'm dealing with anxiety for a while and can tell you that HDr strain is helping a lot since I tried a few days ago. It tastes good and makes you feel happy, uplifted and relaxed with no negatives at all (at least for me). I'm vaping it so can't be sure how it would hit you if you smoke it. Totally recommend Hawaiian Dream strain!”"
lemondude13,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1357530,"“If you love Blue Dream but are looking for a great CBD variety, this is it! I can perfectly describe this as funky fresh tropical bud. Grapefruity citrus sour combined with the familiar Berry funk of Blue Dream makes this smell as good as it smokes. Effects were that of a solid sativa, very energetic and motivating but with absolutely zero anxiety or paranoia. H.D. had me feeling uplifted and inspired for a very long...”"
thismtgirl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1261987,"“I suffer from anxiety and depression. This is my go to! Takes the edge off and helps me get motivated to participate in life. Totally functional 3 to 4 hits and I'm good to go conquer the day. I always get the Moani brand. This last one was THC:4.86% CBD: 14.91%. Very little stoney feeling if so usually passes with in 45 minutes - 1 hour.”"

surfzen88,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1353857,"“Hawaiian Dream, though SUPER delicious - the smell of this strain is good enough to eat - it had zero effect for me. Zero. This is coming from a hyper-sensitive person who has big effects from just about anything and who regularly tries high CBD strains. Maybe it was the particular grower.”"
dankaroo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1410399,"“wow great cbd bud. picked up in seattle moani brand. 4.75% thc and 12.7% cbd. got my body feeling good with a comfortable head high with no paranoid feels. eases my anxiety, tastes great and the bud was real fresh.”"

angier1212,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1202338,"“Very relaxing without being too sedative, nice and mild head-static high
Feels more like an indica dominant hybrid than a sativa”"
DukeRaoul,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1431206,"“Great strain for daytime use and tastes delicious too. Was one of the first strains that got me into CBD. 

Great for pain relief while still being very functional and clear headed. Felt like being wrapped in a warm blanket, 

This strain, as well as Blue Champagne is how I discovered Blue Dream, I found this to be very similar to BD effect wise and highly recommend for a high CBD sativa.”"
cthulhuhoop,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1303141,"“This was a really nice creepy high that helped with my fibromyalgia pain and migraine. I got some pretty strong munchies, which for me is a huge plus as I can't eat otherwise. I will say that it makes me weirdly cranky if I can't relax. I have no in between: I'm either annoyed or super chill, and it happens every time I smoke this one. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯”"
anaedouard,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1477066,"“This strain didn't get me super Stoney,  but it was my first time having a high CBD sativa and it was a good combo for someone like me who doesn't really like sativas. I primarily medicate to treat my anxiety so this was the perfect day time strain for me. It was also super tasty!”"

I like to mix it with something else, Jack Herer in the early day, maybe Grape Ape in the evening. I have not tried it simply on it's own yet, which I will do soon, so I can really see what the effects are by itself.

Ennis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1202339,"“Very focused high.  I had expected something a little stronger and so was slightly disappointed at first.  I smoked some a couple of days later, and the second experience was the true deal.  Hints of Blue Dream in the background -- the sativa influence isn't overwhelming (I have to watch the sativas, so I was happy about this aspect!)

It provides excellent pain relief with a happy, mellow feeling. I would highly recommend this strain for any sort of chronic pain condition. The effects are quite long lasting and taper off gently rather than leave you with a burnt out feeling, which I sometimes get when using certain sativas. The taste is quite pleasant ...”"
koomiekoomy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-dream/reviews/1523088,"“Good CBD quality with good anti-depressant and anti-anxiety qualities. It's a good strain for insomniacs.

Even though it's marketed as a pain relief strain, it still gives a very nice high, even body/head. I don't have too many physical ailments at the moment, so I can't really vouch for its pain relief properties, but the body does feel good.

A year ago I praised it for helping me sleep, but the last batch I bought (also from Moana growers) didn't help my insomnia as much. Don't know if it's this particular crop, or my insomnia is worse - and the strain isn't actually suggested for sleeplessness, so I must have just been very sensitive to it before.
