1. Sight: it's Beautiful. light green, covered in crystals, goldish-tan hairs. a real treat to behold.
2. Smell: the BEST. this baby smells like sweet, green apples🍎 with a hint of diesel and earthiness. one of my favorite smelling strains.
3. Taste: very very good. 👍 sweet, pleasant, and a little flowery/earthy. some hits actually tasted like apple to me. the sour diesel parentage let...”"

jimmyinspazzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-kush/reviews/1591583,"“When a reviewer starts out with an immediate first sentence disclaimer about anything there is good reason to be suspect.  So that is why the second sentence seemed a little more laid back with the padding of the first line which in this case seems more concerning.  Easy to put it off until the 3rd sentence to get that double layer of build up.  Can you feel it?  The tension building up for the most disclaimer-less c...”"

It seems like the gears of time have shifted to my favour. Apple Kush – the slower of time. Subconsciously sitting back, trying to write a poetic review of a strain I hardly ever heard, and basking on its glorified taste, just the way I like it. Apple hints can be traced from the mouth, like from a vision point of view it’s green.

I couldn't place it at first due to the strong twang it possessed, really pungent. I didn't want to stop inhaling it! Then apples was really coming to me but bitter. A thought of those applesours and that was it! Googled "Apple Kush" to lead me here and story certainly checks out with that lovely Sou...”"

Firstly, this is a very pretty strain. Secondly, the SMELL! 👃 🍎!!!
It smells like sweet, green apple with a hint of diesel and earth. I love that the most.
Third, the taste is quite good.👍
I haven't tried Pure Kush, but I have tried Sour Diesel- so it makes sense that it's offspring would taste so delicious! 
Fourth, it feels wonderful. So relaxing, happy, euphoric. Just what I need after a rough, ...”"
Mamen3000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-kush/reviews/1365379,"“First of, the smell, it's unique, the scent of apple is extremely strong and surprisingly tangy. The taste, heavenly, apple pie, sour apple, every thing apple. And then, the high, cerebral at first and creeps and pulsates through your body like rays and shockwaves of relaxation. Very good evening strain.”"

It smells like straight weed and sweet candy apple with dense buds. temporarily cured my cripping depression, anxiety, and ptsd.

When I received this off my 🔌 I liked the look of the dense buds in this 3.5g deal. Beautiful glowing green buds coated in scrumptious orange hair's. I 
Opened the pot to a slight apple more skunky smell, and could not wait to roll one of these babies up 😎👍🏻.

DNeuwir,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/apple-kush/reviews/1390349,"“This is one of the best strains for bedding down for the night. We vape flower at roughly 350F. Starts in the head after about 10 minutes and turns into "bed lock" about 20 minutes in. Not too bad on the dry mouth for us. To my palette, flavor is mostly pine and citrus--"Pine Sol" if you're familiar with the cleaner. Sticks around for about 3 hours but plenty of time to knock me out well when I'm trying to sleep.”"
