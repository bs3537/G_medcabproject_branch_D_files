Gorehill,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kush-cleaner/reviews/1186708,"“The smell was amazing - legit soap. The high is calming and I'd highly recommend it for stress and/or anxiety. Subject to Kush creep”"
Kacktastic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kush-cleaner/reviews/1351020,"“I thought that this strain was a perfect blend of og kush and jack's cleaner. The smoke was rather smooth for the most. The sativa high hit me instantly in the head and then what seemed probably like an hour or so very euphoric and cloudy. Then set in the mellow kush indica but it wasn't overwhelming or did I feel couch locked but I did go and take a nap. Seems like it would be best an hour or so before bed. I would ...”"

RobFallon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kush-cleaner/reviews/1351021,"“I am reviewing the Critical Concentrates Kush Cleaner 50/50 Hybrid Strain. The color is absolutely perfect, with one of the smoother concentrate strains I have tasted in a very long time. The flavors present are citrus, earthy, pine, with a small hint of pineapple. This strain is great for those looking to medicate their pain, or who want to get a focused and creative spark throughout the day. Very Euphoric with mini...”"

CanIHaveAHitOfThat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kush-cleaner/reviews/1351019,"“I've never tasted a strain like this one. It tastes just like berry cream cheese. It's so tasty. I thought maybe I was crazy, so my friends got some and tried it too. We all agree. This is an insanely delicious strain. It hits you like a Mac truck too.”"
TheManThatDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kush-cleaner/reviews/1390043,"“Kush Cleaner is a very appropriate name for this very powerful strain. I got this in Premium Nug Run Sugar and Live Resin Sugar by Paper Planes Extracts. Both were excellent and, unsurprisingly, both had very different flavor profiles. The Premium Nug Run rolled over you like a train and had a tasty terp profile. Earthy, piney, very kushy. The Live Resin had a much more subdued flavor and was a creeper. It was also a...”"

CalvinnHobbes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kush-cleaner/reviews/1515129,"“A friend repaid an old favor and dropped a little of this strain off before the weekend.  The buds looked well groomed and full.  Normally, I'm not kush person, but this looked good! The smell was fruitful with a touch of diesel. As I selected a bud and started to break it apart by hand, the buds proved to be as full as they look. Nowadays, I'm using an herbal vaporizer, so I packed the bowl and set it to low heat to...”"

JourneyAlee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kush-cleaner/reviews/1534874,"“Kush Cleaner packs the power! Dense buds make it imperative that your product has been cured correctly, so breathe deep, and ask for lab results before purchasing. Strong but pleasant scent of pine and earth, with subtler scents of kush, and kind of a pinesol/windex effect. All quite pleasant; nothing overwhelming. Smoke is dense; I'd recommend vaping for those who have difficulty smoking dense strains. The high THC ...”"
Anastasia0101,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kush-cleaner/reviews/1418116,"“Smells a mix between skunky or earthy and pinesol or lemon. Doesn't take much to get high.”"
Meow4me420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kush-cleaner/reviews/1370372,"“I've got the Paperplanes Live Resin Budder, it makes you feel tingly after the 2-3rd hit than it really creeps up within 2 mins. Smell/taste is dank, so fresh & so clean-clean.”"

I was lucky enough to receive a cut of his Jack's Cleaner male and crossed it to all my favorite mother's. Kush Cleaner(sfv OG/ jack's cleaner) is by far the best cross out of the dozen or so I made.”"

Inu420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kush-cleaner/reviews/1335900,"“I initially dabbed this as a 4th option, but it's pretty good. It's onset taste is sour diesel, spice,& wood; and the effect is relaxing and tingly.”"
