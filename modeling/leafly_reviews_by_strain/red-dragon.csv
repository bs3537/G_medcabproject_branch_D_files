AriDavila,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-dragon/reviews/1169159,"“I am in love. It obliterated my writers block with the force of the earth movement. I was clearly able to see the reaction between smoke and humidity, in other words, I saw how smoke turned into liquid drops of beautiful impossibilities.”"
DurbanTurban,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-dragon/reviews/1170319,"“Loved the back of the eyes, uplifting high of this strain. The sweet, herbal and somewhat spicy taste was really tantalizing as well. And who can forget those wonderful red hairs!”"

GoldenSilver,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-dragon/reviews/1084506,"“Red Dragon is very potent to the regular Joe. Be careful mixing with RX drugs, smoking too much will put you on the floor! It does hurt the throat a little bit. I would recommend mixing it with a sativa like Amnesia Haze. Rolling joints, this is a fairly moderate burning strain.”"

cascadianpatriot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-dragon/reviews/1202948,"“Great Sativa with just enough Indica to make it interesting. I actually giggled. Uplifting while still a bit heady.  Good flavor, darkish buds that have some nice color. Doesn't last a particularly long time. But a fun one. F-U-N is a great descriptor.”"

One of the effects I love; you know the feeling you get when you go fast over a hill in a car? That's how I feel...like chills in a good way.
