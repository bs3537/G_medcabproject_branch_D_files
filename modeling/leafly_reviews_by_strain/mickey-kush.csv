Both mentally and physically soothing. Like you’re floating absently in tropical waters. Heads got a slight buzziness - like there’s a strap from the chin, around the cheeks, to the top of the head. Vision is explosive, compelling, and the most fun to get lost in. Nature is very psychedelic - hig...”"

It's a MUST TRY.  I am the type of smoker that likes to try a variety, but I could be content with choosing this as the only sativa I smoke for the next year.

Supermade,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mickey-kush/reviews/1388332,"“This was up there in price at $17 a gram, but its worth it. Very quick and heavy head high. Relaxes the temples and face. The bud looks great, medium to dark greens with many light hairs. The smell is deep, right away you get the sweet citrus but theres a skunky, dirty smell to it as well. The taste is sweet and smooth. Overall great, high THC content, 22.85%.”"

Gives you that feeling that your head is slightly pulling away from your body.   I'll have to try it again earlier in the day to see if the effect is any different.   You know, the weed offered by Arizona dispensaries is really good.”"
heretochill,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mickey-kush/reviews/1418979,"“I've never actually found a strain thats effective for my headaches before this one. Almost instant relief from my most resilient of pains. Very impressed. As for mood, it makes me very talkative and positive, and even gives a sense of confidence? Very clear, focused high. Definitely for good converstantions with friends or before starting a task.”"

Very sweet honey and citrus taste upon inhale and an earthy sweet on exhale, I love her!! The sativa effects are evident, but not enough to induce paranoia. Highly recommended day time medicine.”"
