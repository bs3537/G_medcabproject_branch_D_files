ball8mj,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-diesel/reviews/1372860,"“You will become super focused. It totally creeps up on you and you will get lost in doing somthing. At least, I did. Got a bunch of things done. Took a shower 30 min after smoking too and thinking becomes very clear also which was my favorite attribute.

I am giving it 'exceptional' because of the previous, combined with it literally that it has the nicest smell ever like fruity smells, but dark and not overly potent...”"

As a veteran smoker, I was anticipating the need for a much bigger toke, but one bowl quite did the trick! Veryyy sweet notes while nary a diesel arom...”"
dp61,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-diesel/reviews/1371350,"“I am very particular about which strains I use to manage my symptoms and this Sweet Diesel is a pretty good strain for treating my ailments. I was very surprised at both my ability to focus and having the energy to manifest my efforts creatively. The taste, although slightly like Sour Diesel, is not as "fuelish" and I liked the Earthy after taste, especially with coffee!”"
fortheloveofbudz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-diesel/reviews/1372857,"“This was a great strain, I got it from south coast caregivers and they have A+ quality meds. I was up cleaning my apartment and I was also pain free... Not many strains can give you the best of both worlds.”"
barnell27,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-diesel/reviews/1393102,"“Recieved 1.2 grams of this strain.  As soon as I opened the package I could smell the nonstop sweet aroma take over the diesel smell. This flower is extremely Sweet and smooth tasting.  The nug I recieved was incredibly dense too!!! Burned nice and slow. As the euphoria began (3 hits) I also had a sense of laziness in my legs. But nothing too strong or sedative.

Acquired from PARC Dispensary 
22% THC”"
ms_SWAGG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-diesel/reviews/1372855,"“I liked this better than Sour Diesel.  It tastes good, it's super dank, but it smokes fast (due to the dryness).  I found myself focusing on something so much that I couldn't hear people talking around me, nor did I acknowledge the existence of anything except what I was focused on.  When I was attentive, I was slightly sleepy, but I felt creative, "giggly", and ready to do shit.  This makes a good smoke every once i...”"

kway00,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-diesel/reviews/1371352,"“Easy to smoke and nice taste without a bad long aftertaste. It's a creeper though. It took me about 30 mins to really feel the effect off of one bowl. I talked a lot on it, and the body high is where it's really at. Almost like eating an edible.”"

kefinger20,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-diesel/reviews/1224896,"“Combines two of my favorite Sativa-dominant and Sativa strains. Classic Sour D bud structure. Unmatched OG Kush smell. High is almost balanced. 65/35 ratio Sativa I would say.  Some really great stuff man!”"
neptunechillwave,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-diesel/reviews/1371354,"“Smoked a couple big bowls of Sweet Diesel mixed with Fruit Loops. Nice average high, really creeps up on you.

Curious to those that would know... What's the difference in Headband, Sour Al and this strain? All three are Sour Diesel x OG Kush strains. I've always wondered how you get so many strains from crossing the same two?  Apologies in advance if that sounds like a stupid question.”"

Had very dark thoughts while using this strain and figured it may be my state of mind, tried the next day and had the same results. Granted my state of mind was likely in the same place. Maybe try with friends instead of alone.”"

Very fast stony sensation right behind the eyes as stated in the strain description. I love Sour Diesel. It is one of the few sativas I have grown to like. This is another one of those delicious strains for a good daytime buzz. Keeps the mental cleared but I'm good and toasted and enjoying myself.”"

No snoozing even towards the end. Literally smells like sweet diesel along with a sweet taste. Helpful for depression as well.”"
