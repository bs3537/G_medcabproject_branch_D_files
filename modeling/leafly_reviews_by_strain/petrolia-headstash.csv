Paletrain,https://www.leafly.com/indica/petrolia-headstash/reviews/1478235,"“Absolutely incredible. Sticky, sticky, goodness. I lean more Sativa hybrid, but this particular strain did not provide me with any of the negative symptoms I would usually associate with Indica strains. 

No sleepiness, no unwanted lazy mental attributes. 

The flavor is very reminiscent of the O.G. family, my all time favorite strains. Perhaps this is why I enjoyed it so much. 

Buy it, buy it now!”"

Strong High is great for anxiety, and pain relief and leaves your body feeling relaxed and decompressed. This strain is very stony!

Great Pine Flavor!”"
