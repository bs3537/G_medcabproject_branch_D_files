I've been smoking this before I'm ready to bed down for the evening. Body high is intense. It's easy to lose yourself in relaxation. I don't know what I'm thinking about before falling asleep but I don't care either!

I've combusted with a spoon pipe, bong and a desktop vaporizer. I much prefer the bong with this strain and my intended outcome, everyone's tolerance and wanted results a...”"

It totally got rid of my generalized anxiety for the evening, and helped me get a good nights sleep. The next day I had zero anxiety issues- it was great!”"
mando15,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-happy-rancher/reviews/1359254,"“This strain smells delicious and tastes really good. When I smoked it it gave me a relaxing high but didn't put me to sleep.”"
BerndV,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-happy-rancher/reviews/1359253,"“I tried this strain based upon the recommendation of the budtender at The Novel Tree in Bellevue.  It tastes great, smells delicious, and the high is very relaxed, clear, and euphoric.  At first it feels a bit sativa-like because you don't feel couch locked or sleepy.  However, after a couple of hours I drifted off to a nice sleep.  Overall, a very happy high.  Highly recommended!”"

Udhara,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-happy-rancher/reviews/1743192,"“I really liked this strain. It is a great evening toke. It mellowed me out yet didn't put me in a fog or make me too sleepy right away. When bedtime came a few hours later I didn't need to smoke more I was able to just crawl into bed and fall asleep in good time. I had a great nights sleep. Definitely a good standby for a regular evening. Can still function if I needed to but very happy to just chill on a couch knitt...”"

I feel like people might stop believing my reviews, cause I keep giving everything 5*. But I'm sorry audience, I only review the best buds that haven't knocked me out cause they're shit. This ones good too. So yeah, your journalistic faith is intact with me. 

Surprisingly not all that berryish to me. But, I did have a runny nose walking the dog, so my reefer palate could be fuck...”"

Ostrodamus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-happy-rancher/reviews/1713892,"“Excellent relaxing/sedative effects. A lazy day strain. This is definitely a strain I use before bed time. Initially I got it just for its name (aka Purple Jolly Rancher), and quickly it replaced my melatonin ritual. Tastes great, mine actually tasted like grape. It made me very relaxed and sleepy, I didn't really want to do much after this, and I love it for that.”"

TK42O,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-happy-rancher/reviews/1197236,"“Picked up an eighth of this from Bangs... Fantastic indica-leaning hybrid that doesn't leave you feeling couch locked, but rather comfy and cozy! If you want to drift into a nice sleep you could, but it doesn't overwhelm you into the kush coma that some indicas are known for. Wonderful fresh smell.. beautiful light green and dark purple buds with rust orange hairs that are tough to bust up. 
Definitely one of my new ...”"

The smell is sweet and pungent, the nugs are caked in a yellow/white crystals, but don't worry EVERY nug is purple. The high was heavy on the body with a slight head buzz.

Gave this a try after having it recommended for me by the impressively knowledgeable bud tenders at the White Rabbit Cannabis shop in Lynnwood, WA. Perfectly matched what I was looking for.
