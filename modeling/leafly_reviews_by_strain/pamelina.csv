warpedcassette,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pamelina/reviews/1504116,"“This is definitely an indica-dominant hybrid that has a more cerebral effect than your average indica. I found the "munchie" profile on this one to be quite a bit less than your average indica, but it does have quite a heavy body high with a nice, relaxing, and mildly sedating feel. Avoid daytime use.

The flavor is very interesting - the Rare Dankness parent is dominant on the scent with a hint of pine, ammonia, and...”"

Smokinsince95,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pamelina/reviews/1526740,"“Absolutely had been terrified to try this strain forever, so here I am, for the first time doing as so many others have done and I'm smoking it as I write it... I have th say the flavor in this batch is pretty good. I like all the RD Strains but not a fan of Girls Scout Cookie but I will give this more props for an Indica if is making me pretty stupid which I love but it is also kinda heady and hits you dead center I...”"

You get that visual acumen which turns the corners of your mouth up into a smile. Absolutely recommended for microdosing. Top tier for this old head.”"
gizmosmokes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pamelina/reviews/1465900,"“This is a really nice strain hits hard and makes me cough a lot. hits hard up in the noggin it chills out to a nice relaxing body high shortly. A very balanced high with all the right flavors.”"
Atomic-420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pamelina/reviews/1653781,"“Very light and easy. You'll feel SO relaxed after smoking. The only downside is possibly being too dizzy to make it up the stairs. Gotta sit down with this one for a bit.”"
AlyGoose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pamelina/reviews/1683518,"“It doesn't knock my socks off but it is a really nice body relaxing strain. It's a sweeter tasting strain and was helping curb any stress I was feeling.”"
aestasli,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pamelina/reviews/1414900,"“4 of five for a weird kinda perfumey chemical-like aftertaste after you get past greens. Greens taste fantastic.
Lil bit of a creeper, has a light high you feel immediately but the rest of it hits low and slow and then like a Mac truck crashing headfirst into an ocean wave in slow mo. Full blown high feels like being underwater, everything is peaceful and a little muffled. Really good strain for bedtime.”"
dragonbone,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pamelina/reviews/1535918,"“💣This is everything you want if you’re a fan of indicas. On top of that, this strain is hella tasty! It’s like a lemon tart on the exhale. You’ll be so busy enjoying the flavor that you won’t notice that sedating effect creeping in. You’ll be relaxed in no time. It’s strong but it’s not too heavy (connoisseurs will understand), which makes it a great candidate to use in small doses throughout the day or in larger qu...”"
