Ogre
=============
JackDanieL,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogre/reviews/1412782,"“The Ogre stomps out of the jar in large healthy nugs, dark overall in nature with deep forest greens and wild shoots of dark orange-brown hairs from every nook.  It breaks down easily and its sweet lemony pine kush aroma only gets stronger as you get into the heart of the bud.  A nice even burn, just harsh enough to let you know its there, with an equally pleasant release, followed by an almost instant need to sit do...”"

It gives a decent high, but it's competition like Sour Diesel, Green Crack, and other well known strains at the shop over power my pocket. 

Orge gives a strong high. If you come across cheap Ogre (I got a gram for $8), I would definitely grab it up, but like I said before, I wouldn't donate anymore th...”"

Dont look for lowest price actually look for highest price that will most likely be the best grown unless the co-op's just trying to sell mids for a high price.

Sapphyy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogre/reviews/1411312,"“Picked up an eighth of this because the budtender recommended it to me. It's a strain that's wonderful to smoke at the end of a long day. It provides a nice couch-lock yet keeps you awake. It's not going to put you straight to sleep but would still be a good strain to save for the evening.

Veritablian,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogre/reviews/1314446,"“Master Kush x Bubba Kush = OGRE OG. 

One of the best indica strains I've had since Herijuana OG.

She has an earthy tone with skunky notes highlighting each toke. Hints of the Master Kush are noticeable; with a resiny earthyness you won't find from many other Kush strains. 

This is because Bubba Kush stems from the extremely potent mix of OG Kush and (West Coast Dog x Old World Kush).”"
Winterbreeze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogre/reviews/1323377,"“Note, I am a total lightweight and take what are apparently considered itty-bitty hits. So, I always double-check descriptions on other sites, and it's recommended for evening, though it's apparently not a popular strain, and I don't know why. This is stunning in its ability to calm my shit FAST. I have severe bipolar disorder,  with a nasty side of anxiety. If I start to have a panic attack and I smoke just a little...”"

Irish91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogre/reviews/1393391,"“Ogre Kush smells like straight skunky death mixed with a little fruit :3 so dank and smokes like an OG with a heady effect at start that quickly evolves to a body high . Good smoke but paid to much . CO buds.”"
Reighly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogre/reviews/1344637,"“Tight, Green, and dense buds stumbled into my water pipe with a thud!

Will try again if I see it - not the greatest looking (altho not bad as all) nor the greatest smelling, but the buzz is very strong.  Couch Lock in higher quantities.”"

Purple_Baphomet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogre/reviews/1308877,"“Ogre is a mind-melting awesome cross of two of the best kushes (Master Kush and my all-time favorite, Bubba Kush) and it certainly looks like it. The smell is quite unique, with a strong smell of lemon, leaving the traditional piney Kush smell just in the background.

Ogre at Medicine Man smells soooo sweet and smooth.
It smells and tastes like the most wonderful Kush with a potent Grape, maybe even blueberry!  Either way this has to be my favorite!

For me, I have to take this in a safe place, like my home, cause if I go out while high on this, I get paranoid like I'm gonna get busted or something. I would suggest doing this one at home.”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogre/reviews/1436988,"“Imagine being wrapped in the most comfortable blanket that emits happiness. That's the best description I can give of this strain. It's super happy, then incredibly melty soon followed by amazing sleep.  If you love a strong dose of euphoria right before bed, then this would be a great choice. Don't expect to get anything done. Nice.”"
