Pop up, layback, hang-ten and enjoy the tube then carve n charge racing for the lip busting a gnarly kick out as the Sativa come alive. It's totally raddical and wickedly awesome dude.”"
macprincess,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haole/reviews/1256334,"“It's not my favorite. This particular batch was not top shelf. Although dense, I have found 4 seeds in 3 bowls. I wonder how much of my weight actually went to what I'm sure are unusable seeds. That's on the grow/dispensary tho. Not necessarily indicative of the strain. It is a pretty even 50/50 hybrid as suggested. You get a little sativa, a little indica. It is harsh tho. Reminds you of old school regs lol. Makes f...”"

SadieBashes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haole/reviews/1214492,"“This would be soo much better if the effects didn't wear off in 15 minutes... I guess this is a quick fix, but not really worth it to buy it again.”"
thedude79,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haole/reviews/1213812,"“It makes you feel energetic and then relaxation. No headache. The quality was maybe outdoor. Not top shelf.”"
Kittykaryall,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haole/reviews/1207701,"“Tasty and frost. Look definitely a 5! To quote the canadian lyricist Drake. "0 to 100 real quick" ...defines how high you feel, and just as you peak, you're so stoned you don' t realize that you're coming down. I just wished it lasted longer.”"

WastachWriter,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haole/reviews/1343507,"“I am prone to anxiety, so I normally stick to Indicas and high CBD strains. I don't know why I experimented with this stuff, but it's a bad fit for me personally. Just a few hits made me cranky and paranoid. YMMV”"
OrlandoMedicalClub,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haole/reviews/1356275,"“great frosty nugs, very dense yet fluffy buds with sweet and peppery flavors, great for relaxing. Strong medicine great for muscle issues and stress.”"

Jtucson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haole/reviews/1263551,"“It is a good strain for novices or maybe monthly users but lacks a good taste. The batch I got was a little harsh but did present the effects I was looking for. However, I have been smoking for 15 years on and off, so I might have a slightly higher tolerance and I am very particular when it comes to a strain being a smooth and tasty smoke. If you are just starting out, I would recommend this strain and a few others t...”"
Scribzilla,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haole/reviews/1252793,"“If you stumble across a perfect batch it's fairly similar to Gorilla Glue #4. It's almost like Gorilla Glue fucked a Mango and this is it's smokable offspring :)”"

millermondays,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haole/reviews/1195290,"“Smells a little diesel/lime almost.. Combustion wise taste reminds me of nasty brick, vaping brings out a lot more nice complexity without so much burnt yam, more grape or lime or both..  Nice high.. Almost stony like but with energy and a focus like that”"

I like this strain because I can't necessarily stay medicated all day long, but because it fades after about 2ish hours for me so I can go to work without worry.”"

Heidi2669,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haole/reviews/1244616,"“I suffer from severe anxiety when driving and this "miricle" strain has completely rid me of. It's not too strong for me to function and mellows me out without laying me out.
It's now a must have in my medicine cabinet while I toss out the valium !”"
