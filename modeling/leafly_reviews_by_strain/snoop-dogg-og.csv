Not only does it have a bomb kush smell it really has sweet aftertaste! A full on body high, couch locked if you want, or adventurous. It has the ability to adapt to whatever you are doing! Daily smoker and I definitely reccomend!”"

Snoop Dogg OG has a powerful taste and pungent earthy smell. Continuous feeling of well being maintains for quite a while. This medicine made me hungry and relaxed at the same time.

IronlionZion,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snoop-dogg-og/reviews/1415397,"“Smell: Definitely not a strain you can ride around with without anyone knowing, it has a strong diesel scent with a slight lemony pine skunk. 

Taste: very diesel with lemon aftertaste which lingers on the tongue. 

Effects: felt almost immediately, gives you a rush from head to toe and leaves you tingly. The first 30 minutes or so are giggly and intense, but you remain pretty focused after that. This strain keeps on...”"

This is some potent weed, so it will blow through your tolerance if you have one (at least it did for me). Immediately after a hit or two you're going to start feeling it in your body.
