OhilaOfKarn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/le-silver-royale/reviews/1292740,"“I had a toothache. Shortly after smoking this, I forgot I had teeth, much less a toothache. Great painkiller! It was supremely relaxing and the head high made everything hilarious. 

The comedown is long and gentle, leaving you loose and happy for a good 3 hours.”"

I love the instant stress relief this strain gives me - it's a soaring energetic high that's also very euphoric. Great for depression. 5/5!”"
