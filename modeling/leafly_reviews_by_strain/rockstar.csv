Rockstar
=============
PuffDaddy97,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1417102,"“"Rockstar", is indeed one of my "Favorite strains", she climbs up on you, very quickly and you feel a body buzz and head high and she's definitely strong enough to relieve my pain in my muscles, joints..nerves..I'm dealing with a number of  Chronic Health Conditions..Fibromyalgia..Osteoarthritis.”"
zombieskin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1418755,"“Slight paranoia when you get a little /too/ high, but used as directed, it's a pretty awesome strain for getting through your work day with a skip and a smile. Bonus pot for artists. Definitely not a sleepy weed.

Sex is also great on this one, though I can't say it made me more aroused beforehand, specifically.

I give it a 10, because I love it, and I'd get it again in a second.”"
SgtPillow,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1417103,"“Super good strain, gets you stoned quickly and is the most relaxing strain I have ever had. 9/10”"
MrMedi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1417398,"“Rockstar is a very potent strain useful for Insomnia and pain. its smell is insanely pungent, almost reminiscent of a Kush, however with very fruity undertones. Very dense buds covered in Orange hairs, Rockstar is very Aesthetically pleasing. Usually has a THC content typically in the 20s. Very Fruity/Hashy flavour, This Hybrid is a Must try for Heavy Tolerance smokers. Definitely a Keeper!”"
mattny,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1417106,"“Yet again I'm making a review for Rockstar 😁 for very good reason. I love the tangy, spicy, skunky, pungent smell to this one. Full body stone/relaxing head buzz hits quite fast. This is a strong, yet functional stone. Sometimes I feel waves of buzzing going all throughout my body starting in my legs, creating that floating sensation. So good for stomach issues and appetite, pain, depression, stress and anxiety. Bes...”"
whats,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1417105,"“What a ridiculously heavy high. Weighed me right down to my couch and numbed my mind to the point where I wasn't very functional. This strain is best enjoyed in a relaxing setting where you are not expected to do anything. Incredibly potent.”"
jaws,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1412111,"“Extremely dense, with a definite flavor of grapes, the buds of this strain have a high potency. One hit and Rockstar can have you singing like Dee Snyder's and Pat Benatar's illegitimate love child. Contains a bit of an earthy flavor as well. I recommend this one for sure. Hit it with your best shot, cause, we're not gonna take it!”"
goonerfc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1341170,"“The more you smoke the more you feel like a rockstar. The best thing about this strain is that you do not feel a burnout unless your hitting constant 5 min bowls you'll be knocked out.  You do not get tired from this but you will be lifted”"
Leeleafly,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1339833,"“Vaped a small bowl in my Silver Surfer and it obliterated my back pain (I have "mild" scoliosis). I am a daily vaper with a HIGH tolerance, usually I would need several bowls to feel effects even from the highest THC/CBD flower or shatter. With Rockstar a little goes a long way for me and I like the uplifting cerebral high. #2221”"

Eric420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1417110,"“Rockstar is a heavy indica probley one of the heaviest indicas i know of and it hits u super hard at first with an uplifting high for 10 minutes and then it knoks u in the face and leaves u stuck to the couch, really Euphoric forsure a mood changer, on a medical stand point, i noticed this would perfect for insomnia, and people who suffer from headaches or migraines without a dought for pain, anxiety and depression. ...”"
GinCrimson27,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1074354,"“Great bud for people who don't like that "bugging out" feeling a genuine sativa will give you. Rockstar gives you gentle euphoria. It's not the kind of bud that will send you into uncontrollable fits of laughter though. At the same time, Rockstar does not give you that couch-lock feeling, one is still capable of functioning and its effect is not debilitating in any way. It brings about a rather balanced high.”"
KyleFromVanIsle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1309618,"“Trippy and Powerful. Yikes. My limbs felt weak, I forgot to breathe, I was so baked. Too baked truthfully, at least for a stretch of about 30 - 45 minutes before the "edge" wore off. 

All I can say is go easy. One or two tokes then wait! Give it 15 minutes, then ask yourself how you feel. Trust me.

Powerful indica cannabis.”"
Mastrom12,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1391664,"“For an indica dominant hybrid 60%/40% Rock Star certainly packs a full bodied punch. I felt the uplifting headiness come on instantly and a relaxing buzz slowly creep up and wash over my body. I found this herb to be soothing to the muscles and mind, and also a good appetite stimulant and anti-emetic. Works great for headaches and any type of body pain and won't weigh you down or give you a dulled mind like heavier i...”"

AnonBubble,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1297772,"“I vaporized this strain using my G Pen Pro and it gave me a body high, and almost no psychoactive high. I was much more attentive to my surroundings and the cold Canadian Winters weren't so bad anymore. While riding my motorcycle this made a long trip home seem like a mission rather than just getting home. The munchies are through the roof on this one.

3lixr,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1355257,"“Taste is fantastic. Smooth smoke from bong, tasty vapour from vape. So potent, was totally unexpected, even for a daily toker and vaper. The high is definitely that of an indica, although there are still intense cerebral effects, which is the only reason I didn't rate this a 5/5 in fact; The effects can become much too intense mentally making it hard to fall asleep.

It has a VERY interesting taste (spice and pepper, I think?), but it goes down smoothly, for the most part. Some tokes have been a little hard on me, but that's only if I take too much at a time.

HeavyBongRips,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1280345,"“Rockstar is by far one of the most potent indicas I have ever tried. I wonder if bears have used this strain for hibernation as it not only relaxes the body, but sends tranquility through the mental state of a regular stoner.”"
DirtyDoug07,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1620000,"“I find I lean more towards sativa strains, but this hybrid leaves me feeling energetic. Also the pain levels for my back and knees are bearable. Super sweet with notes of grape but with a skunky and sour taste. Extremely good bud. 10 of 10 would buy again.”"

Jackelmob,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1396710,"“This train is crossed with Afghani and OG as the name suggests they are rock hard buds. I've gotten this from a few places and it's hard to get a nice big Cola off and if you do it's beautiful! The thing about this train is it's in the middle more of upper end as in it's around 20% THC it's not too expensive. I suggest if you're on a budget to try some good bang for the buck!”"
Javatyger,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1453007,"“This strain really messed me up, but in a good way. :) Very potent strain that creeps up on you and lasts a long time. I, however, am not the greatest with high THC strains, so I was out of it for awhile. Be careful with this one and know your limits as once this one takes hold, it doesn’t like to let go anytime soon.”"

skipadee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1305220,"“Bought 2 different types of Rockstar (produced by different growers). 
One have me mega anxiety. Horrid. Gave it to the husband who didn't experience the same. 
The other was okay. Take at night for sure for a good rest. But I can think of tons of other indicas that do a way better job.”"

xSilas42069,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1299304,"“Daamn, this strain has a pretty decent smell but the effects are great, not too sedating but quite relaxing, more of a creative feeling. Works quite well to treat my migraines.”"

flowerfloo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1369775,"“Beautiful in a gentle environment you completely control. Fast, easy up, to a relaxed and happy place with functional alertness, near imperceptible return to earth. However, I took it out and about into busy and restrictive environments, once, and was wickedly anxious. So a word of caution there.”"

DavidWard,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar/reviews/1230756,"“I don't smoke indicas often and I've only smoked this once. It really helped me sloooooow down and meditate in peace. Quite a pleasant treat of a high. I would say it is a medium strength and geared towards the head rather than the body. Recommended if you're looking to just chill out for a spell. Nice full flavor too.”"
