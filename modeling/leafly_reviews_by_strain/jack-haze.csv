Jack Haze
=============
ARStewart41,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-haze/reviews/1373433,"“Strain: Jack Haze
Type: Sativa-Dominant (90% Sativa)
Genetics: Jack Herer x Super Silver Haze
Notes: Fluffy, elongated dark green nugs with sweet lemon pine aroma. Smooth smoke with sweet taste, no coughing. High is racy and euphoric, with a distinctly excited and upbeat contentment. The high is very clear-headed and focused with a distinctly creative element. Music is extremely enjoyable and immersive, as well as...”"

But that's okay; top shelf price better include testing. Starts off zooming, uplifted, talkative, giggly for the first hour and some change. Then tapers down into a chill-state. almost no groggy remnants. very nice for a small gathering where you can be social and show your "true-er" colors to your buddies. highly recommend...”"
mindbend,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-haze/reviews/1153196,"“This is strong weed. I smoked it alone. Hadn't smoked in three years and did go a little overboard, mostly because I had a second joint after I started coming down from the first high. 

It's a very pleasant, uplifting high, mostly cerebral -- great for contemplation or creative work. It's starts with a mild tingling buzz and then leaves you just feeling happy and giggly and excited. I watched the new 'Rock of Ages...”"

I smoked a half of a small joint and was taken to a place where enjoyment reigns. I don't remember smoking a sativa that lasted this long. It's a good two and a half hours of heady effects.”"

Tomate87,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-haze/reviews/1284376,"“Jack Haze is a great day strain if used in moderation, it is like having a cup of black coffee but it is also a good evening strain if you have a little more too relax and be by yourself, play video games, watch nextflix... Gets me a little dizzy but no couch lock, I get very talkative and have a tendency to overthink so I wouldnt say it's exactly relaxing.
Anyway; I would buy it again.”"

No groggy after-feeling whatsoever. 
Great strain for the Multitasker...
although taste not as sweet as others. 
All in all very happy 🤘🏼”"

akralston,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-haze/reviews/1062971,"“Very Nice - said to be sativa-dominant but makes me very sleepy in a nice way.  Not a struggle-to-keep-your-head-up way but a time-to-get-under-the-covers way.  Very positive semi-head buzz and good uplifter.”"
theman711,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-haze/reviews/1341688,"“I got this Jack Haze from a nice coffeeshop here in Leiden, The Netherlands. I guess the name implies that it's Jack Herer cross-bred with some Haze, making for an intense Sativa baby. I smoked not even a full bowl of this and I was in outer space. I only packed a small nug and it did the job. I was getting so high that I could close my eyes and imagine I was on roller coaster. In fact, that sensation got so real tha...”"
blacklight76,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-haze/reviews/1199294,"“This one just doesn't agree with me as much as other strains. Not one to usually get anxious right after smoking, this one unfortunately gets that job done for me. Bit of a lasting anxiousness too, as it lingers for a while after nearly all other effects have subsided. It does have an apparent potency (indeed, it certainly is like a strong cup of coffee) but the high isn't as 'clean' as other strains, for lack of a b...”"
SophieGu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-haze/reviews/1240983,"“Got to smoke this one with friends, we all got different negative reactions.. I got more anxious than usual, another friend got super paranoid seeing black dots and the other... Well, she got really sick. I thought maybe I made it too strong, but later I tried again and still the high was bad. 

So just keep in mind it might hit you in the wrong way...”"

I've never felt such an uplifting effect before. this strain is great for lightening up your mood. not only that, but you still feel incredibly focused and in controloof yourself.  definitely one strain you don't want to miss out on.  I would say the perfect time to smoke this would be before going out with your buddies. it puts you in a phenomenal mood and your head still feels clear. perfect for when you ...”"
