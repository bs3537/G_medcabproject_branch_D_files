I fired this up on a beautiful late Sunday afternoon as the sun rays were shining on my face and the gentle breeze woke up the leaves and they waved to me.  I realized I was grinning from ear to ear and felt so happy to be alive on such a wonderful day.  It took away stress and pain, and left me with happy and positive vibes.”"

knows how or were to get clones let me know”"
TheGhostHead,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medicine-woman/reviews/1387583,"“Pungent! Earthy! Tangy, almost...
From inhale to rolling the vapor and/or smoke off the tongue and cheeks to full exhale this wild and intoxicatingly beautiful bud would grab the back of the eyes and lift. As if pulling you into motion as opposed to stillness; just with ALL the pain and nausea relief of a dank and dark Indica.

I had this three separate times from Next Level Wellness-a premier OMMP establishment here...”"
HarvestMasterRentals,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medicine-woman/reviews/1410474,"“Great body relaxing high. Melts to pain away but leaves the mind clear and happy.”"
SilverEM,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medicine-woman/reviews/1410473,"“Great overall pain reliever, but still a clear head and good energy.  Relieved all over muscle pain and cramping. Activating, but still relaxing and didn't cause anxiety. The product I got was around 12% THC, so a lot lower than typical for this strain.”"
CarmanSanDiego425,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medicine-woman/reviews/1373930,"“This strain has been great for turning my fibro down days into a get S. done day. 
Doesn't matter if I'm hiking a beautiful trail or tackling a mound of laundry, it gives me the energy to get it done. Great for relaxing my muscles and easing my pain but without dragging me to bed.”"
unblessedxheart,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medicine-woman/reviews/1410475,"“One of my buddy's had Medicine Woman for years, he always offered it to his female friends when they'd mention experiencing cramps. He loaded up a bowl for me (whilst I was sitting there in pain) and told me to let him know how I felt. 2 years later and I swear by Medicine Woman for cramps!!! He no longer has it & this upsets us both, me because I experience craps again, him because it's just an overall great strain”"
OGTash,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medicine-woman/reviews/1386924,"“I really enjoyed this Sativa Dom! I usually prefer a hybrid in general but I felt very uplifted and happy. I love to sing and cook and this mos def put me in the mood to get creative! I love the somewhat diesely or skunky smell yet slightly piney and its wild looking nugs.  It also helped with pain and anxiety. This beautiful medicine woman is healing indeed.”"
ShenaK,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medicine-woman/reviews/1577610,"“I really like this strain, really helped my body relax and a nice head high. I have chronic back pain, this really helps me. I take it at night and it helps me sleep all night.”"
piecemaker77,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medicine-woman/reviews/1320479,"“Slow start but strong finisher! Buds are thick and flufy, full nugs from top to botom. Makes pink and purple buds.”"
clance42,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medicine-woman/reviews/1386926,"“Medicine Woman: THC ? CBD ?
Feeling of euphoria and creativity. Lackadaisical and happy. I feel I can either go for a run or lay back and watch a movie. Create the sistine chapel or write a novel. 
Headaches are null and void which is a big deal since I get clusters! My hip feel absolutely wonderful. 

Cons
Slight Cotton mouth (but then what strains don't give you cotton mouth)”"

I'd been smoking blackberry cream earlier on, which is an indica dominant strain but it was like these two strains were from the upside world haha. The sativa dominant put me down in short order, the indica (blackberry cream) made me really really happy & relaxed but no couch lock or sleepiness. I loved them both, but for different reasons. This medicine ...”"
