OG Kush
=============
retnolsmiff,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush/reviews/1416881,"“The best strain of cannabis if I had the ultimate say so, the true definition of dank. Purchase in large quantities if possible, as it can heal in multiple facets. Can you work out after smoking it? Hell yeah. Can you sit on the couch all day and play the Playstation? You damn right. I love it, truly, and if it was all I could ever smoke, I'd die a happy and high fella. Peace to all.”"
flyguywill,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-kush/reviews/1417675,"“These nugs were dark and massive, fairly dense with a piney chocolate smell and covered in orange hairs and crystals. Overall it looked like the definition of DANK, very difficult to bust up too. But the high was something else, very uplifting and social buzz kicks in within a few minutes followed by euphoria and body buzz, powerful and very talkative high. A MUST TRY!! dont pass it up, its a beautiful strain!”"

After each hit, I love talking with her, Whether it be about our day, us and our future, or life experiences or little things. This weed is GREAT for that, take your time with it, take a hit from the bong and let it take its course and fully hit you before taking another. Experience each kind of high.

I have noticed that despite verying THC content in various bags over the past few years, it always calms my nerves and brings my pain to a level thats manageable. It has its own distinct terpene popping smell of pine and citrus that I believe play a huge role in its overall medicinal benefits.”"

This strain is fantastic. I'm relaxed and stress goes away immediately.  
Bud vs Concentrate with OG K. Some strains, I'd stick to Bud but for OG I would recommend concentrate because the effects are much better (personnal opinion) with the concentrate.
No side effect other than the typical glass of water after your hit. 
Really good with Stress, Anxiety”"
