The buds appear...”"

A dispensary near me has blueberry which is my favorite but they charge high prices so I tried Goo at a different dispensary and it's very similar enough to substitute it. Currently one of my favorite strains. When my brain is too active I smoke this and it helps calm it down.”"
Luna1177,https://www.leafly.com/indica/goo/reviews/1369516,"“One of my favorites for escaping into a canopy of relaxation and wonder.

As a 4 year dabber this is the kind of oil I search for.
Gooey at room temp, easy to put on dabbing tool, burns clean and tasty.  Only few random bits of particulate matter but wasn't common at all.
Have re-ordered this type three times already!”"

SweetHerbTreats,https://www.leafly.com/indica/goo/reviews/1316997,"“This is my absolute favorite strain for cooking! It's a wonderful Indica for medical usage (for me, that means treating anxiety, insomnia, and minor pain relief.) The flavor profile is sweet, berry, and woody, so I like to make cannaoil (with coconut butter) and bake a dessert with berries, or add the oil to a berry and spinach smoothie if I'm feeling healthy! The berry/sweet flavors are so nice for smoking, too. You...”"

highdefnition,https://www.leafly.com/indica/goo/reviews/1207835,"“Underappreciated gem. Snagged a Purple Thai leaning phenotype. Not ur typical afghan/ hashplant, its alot more berry/earthy with a back end of skunk. In flower it smells like blueberry pancakes, but cures out to a sour almost grapey/ fermented wine smell. Resin production is thick and concentrates made from it taste incredible. Great for chilling out at the end of a long day.”"

Very mild, low to medium THC percentage flower that brings on a light weight & very relaxed buzz.  Depending on reaction to this strain it could be used for so many different things with its versatile nature.  Pain relief being number one followed by lowering anxiety with a fierce case of munchi...”"
