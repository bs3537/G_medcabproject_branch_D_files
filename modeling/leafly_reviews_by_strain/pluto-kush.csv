Pluto Kush

Budmasta',https://www.leafly.com/indica/pluto-kush/reviews/1392017,"“A variety of Og kush.  It is said that the farther away from the sun the stronger the stain is, well I don't really care if that's true because this is one of my favorite strains.  Super strong effects that allow anyone to sleep easily and manage their pain.  Sleep is the best way to avoid the munchies.”"
Jcreer88,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pluto-kush/reviews/1392016,"“I don't know why there's such little reviews on such a great indica strain! This bud is probably one my top favorite indica bud out there. It gives me that cerebral high then is followed by an intense body high that i can feel flow through out my body. Plus, i can still function and do what it is i need to get done! An indica that sort of gives you that smooth but long lasting high without the stress of being couched...”"

I smoke it to help me sleep, eat and calm down. It helps me feel better when I'm unwell. It also helps with my pain, giving a great, tension-melting body high.”"

JoeInLA,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pluto-kush/reviews/1584010,"“Bought an HP of this strain. Had never had it but the deal was too good. Didn’t try it till I busted open the vacuum bag. The aroma is a combination of Jack Herer’s fruitiness with skunk. It is amazing. 

The effects are awesome and potent. Instant sedation. Think tranquilizer dart. And this is from a 1-2g/ day smoker. (3g on weekends 😑)

What’s confusing is you can still speak and think. For a while. It’s pretty he...”"

RWright,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pluto-kush/reviews/1509457,"“I'm a lover of indica's and this didn't disappoint.  For me, Pluto's onset was what you would expect of a straight indica at 28pct thc.  Out of bed at 3am with pain, so decided to try pluto instead of an OG I had planned on.  Wasn't disappointed with pain relief and overall total body comfort and was able to fall back asleep.

It's not Cherry Pie or GDP, but's special in it's own way.  Would buy again, def at this Th...”"
casurfer212,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pluto-kush/reviews/1392019,"“Whoever said this strain is harsh is correct.  That's my only complaint.  Will get you lit up though. Sitting here blazed as I type this. Stick to other planetary strains such as Neptune Saturn or Mercury OG.  They are not as harsh and the nugs not as dense.  These nugs are a little too dense for my liking.  Peace and happy smoking.”"
AaronD,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pluto-kush/reviews/1392020,"“Really drowsy-sleepy high. Perfect for just hanging out watching movies, or a bedtime smoke. Hit almost instantly after exhale which is nice. Tastes fruity with a kushy brackground.”"

Pluto Kush brings out that Pagan girl dancing in the woods at night with her eyes lined in charcoal. I LOVE this strain and it has become one of those by which I measure all other strains. It kicks pain in the ass, relaxes me enough to manage the intense anxiety that builds up in my whenever my body is at rest AND I am still able to function enough to enjoy my evening. My other half...”"

TejanoSinger,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pluto-kush/reviews/1064232,"“The stuff I had was kinda harsh. Not the worst strain but not the best. I wouldn't care to rush out and get this any time soon. I will stick to other strains such as Skwalker, Fire, and Kandy.”"
