GradeAproducer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-punch/reviews/1416332,"“This top notch strain is by far my favorite!
Granddaddy Purp and Larry OG...
I call it Granddaddy Larry (remember that belt?...lol)

The formation and color is astonishing,  big, dense, flagrant purple and green covered in sugary goodness.
The grapy tart sweet smell is transferred from lighting up to clipping out.
the smoke is smooth yet expansive if held for too long (cough) 
The (Pax2) vaporizer would heighten the ...”"
MetaphysicalVibrations,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-punch/reviews/1416334,"“this strain quickly reminds me why indicas are the shit. Not only are all my muscles relaxing/releasing tension, but as my body feels better, my mental health also seems to improve with a good-hearted outlook on life as time seems to slow down and nature takes center stage. Not a couch potato like others suggested....it just gets you so relaxed you want to savor your peaceful state =)”"

The "punch", in Purple Punch, is twofold:
1. The flavor of fruit punch is imaginable when exhaled 
2. The feeling of being tagged by a hard punch after about five good hits.

A fine herb; solid as a rock, and totally covered in white crystals, Purple Punch punches with a couple of quick jabs to the forehead with the first 2-3 hits, then lands an uppercut with hits 4-5, to set this o...”"
11hydroxythc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-punch/reviews/1416333,"“one of my favorite strains currently. this strains aroma profile pre lit was very pleasant. it reminded me of fruit punch. once lit the flavor profile matched the aroma, berries, and light citrus is what I tasted. The high is very pleasent and packs alittle of a surprising punch at first then mellows into a both head and body high. I noticed my self talking more then usual.”"
Just_Awkwardd,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-punch/reviews/1412825,"“Pretty strong strain, but one of the best if you're really looking for a good sleep. Although smoking a lot when you wake up it can make you feel really groggy.”"

A disclaimer, I will judge this strain and all future strains based on three categories - Physical Appearance, Taste, and Experience.

Purple Punch looks like it was harvested from an alien world. The flower is intoxicatingly purple as the name implies and it's covered in sparkling white trichomes and...”"
snxdy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-punch/reviews/1385467,"“Very new strain and very good. The nugs are very pretty. Even though they don't have a lot of purple, they have a lot of purple and wine colored veins. The green parts, mostly because of the frost, are a pale green. Also, the taste is amazing; it's like grape soda.”"
poserdisposer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-punch/reviews/1385463,"“10/10. Dense bud structure with hues of green and dark purple and ridiculous trichome production. This strain is literally caked with frost and it smells incredible. The high creeps up on you with a wave of body and mind relaxation with a euphoric head buzz. One of my top 3 favorite strains!”"
Timbaroo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-punch/reviews/1651396,"“There aren’t many strains I would say that I’d keep in my stash on a regular basis, but Purple Punch is one of them. It’s certainly a five star strain that seems to have been sweeping the market for about a year, but now it’s saturated the market. Luckily, however, it’s such a great high in any form in any quality, that that’s a good thing. Unlike Girl Scout Cookies and it’s phenotypes, which are everywhere but rarel...”"

The purple punch I picked up at TLC smelled like sweet delicious grape sour gummy straws that had grape generic-aid sprinkled all over it and I'm not exaggerating here.

It's an Indica which to me says body high and couch lock and, even though I felt both, neither were too intense.  PP is mild and not very effective for insomnia, my reason for choosing it.  So I'll smoke it happily but it's not in my top ten.”"
