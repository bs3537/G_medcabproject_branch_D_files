It doesn't take long to effect and will leave a strong head high accompanied with the feeling that everyone is doing just as well as you. super talkative, very fun strand to stay active and en
joy the next 2 hours. I highly recommend this strand for 
anyone wanting to try a good and strong hybrid that leans toward the sativa side.”"
MrFigueroa91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/serious-happiness/reviews/1526431,"“Euphoric and relaxing. Perfect strain for any day, has enough sativa traits to leave you buzzing like a bee without all the anxiety that some sativa strains bring. The indica traits are heavy and well received, lovely relaxation throughout the body with a tingly-easy-going like high that proceeds this strains' name. Head feels as light as a feather as well haha SERIOUS HAPPINESS ✌♥️”"
antjblood,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/serious-happiness/reviews/1597877,"“Serious Happiness is a most appropriate moniker for this strain. I was SERIOUSLY happy after a few draws from a small joint, a grin  plastered on my face. Medicating with this flower catalyzed my most content high of all time. 

I smoked it just before bed, but this was a mistake. After extinguishing my joint of Serious Happiness, I promptly typed away until 3 AM. This strain is a GAME-CHANGER for those who experienc...”"

jamaicadreamin99,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/serious-happiness/reviews/1512659,"“This strain has worked wonders for my depression. When you puff on it, you instantly feel happy and euphoric. That's pretty much the main feeling, but this is a great strain to mix with an indica like mango or 9 pound hammer if you want to feel relaxed or sleepy as well. If you have depression and you don't want to feel too stoned, I recommend this strain.”"

DivaofSongs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/serious-happiness/reviews/1514824,"“This hit me like a ton of bricks, and I only had two hits! Within 3 minutes, I was having a severe panic attack........anxiety, paranoia, dizziness and panic set in, it was awful! I felt totally disconnected from reality, like I was on the outside of my life, looking in, and I didn't like what I was seeing. I tried to eat something to come down a little bit, but but my mouth was so dry, I almost choked on a cookie! L...”"
Smy90,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/serious-happiness/reviews/1527787,"“Dark green buds covered with beautiful orange hairs.  Has a very pungent yet sweet mango-like aroma to it.  Surprisingly smooth smoke with a noticable taste of black pepper to it.    Very noticable head high followed by full body relaxation, but won't knock you out.  A great daytime strain.”"
jwood156,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/serious-happiness/reviews/1595051,"“This is my favorite strain, it is very aptly named.”"
RWright,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/serious-happiness/reviews/1572443,"“Pretty decent head effect for stress or anxiety.  Wasn't the best for my pain, but a decent smoke just the same.  Mine was stated to be 30.3 pct.  Didn't hit me like a traditional 30 pct thc hybrid should.  First time saying this, but probably won't buy again.

Peace”"
megzlacass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/serious-happiness/reviews/1604937,"“I'm agreeing with most people so far that this was definitely a heavy head high mixed with some paranoia at first then melts into a relaxed, happy stage after a bit. Tasted good. Everytime I seem to use this strain though, my throat feels weird after. Scratchy, dry and almost sore but numb. Very strange and noticed it a few times so certain it's from this strain.”"
cabaretpunk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/serious-happiness/reviews/1580587,"“Ok, so this may sound weird, but this strain gives me auditory hallucinations!  A bit after smoking, every time without fail, I start hearing music, faint but distinct, like it's coming from an adjacent apartment. I don't mind it so much, most of the time the music is good, haha. This was from Boggy Boon, and the tagline on the package is "Happy, Euphoric, Uplifted."”"
Puma2015,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/serious-happiness/reviews/1782517,"“Pretty upper strain, when you're feeling down, this definitely brought my mood up. made me feeling happy and chill, it doesn't really help with my body pain though. Good strain for socializing.”"
