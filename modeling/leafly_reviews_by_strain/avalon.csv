Avalon

DamienDarke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avalon/reviews/1244213,"“Avalon wasn't bad, but by far not the best I have smoked.  It made me fell hungry and gave me a great body high.  It's a very good strain for the new smokers, but shoudn't be taken lightly.”"
Kushgodrod,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avalon/reviews/1127820,"“This strain was alright, it has a chocolate smell.. It defiantly does get you aroused. Im saving the rest of mine for that special smoke sesh wit my girl;)”"
BayouBoi777,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avalon/reviews/1244214,"“Not super heavy but nice body effect.  It really does contribute to arousal ;)”"
