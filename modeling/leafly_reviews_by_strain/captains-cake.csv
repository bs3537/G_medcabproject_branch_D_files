Captain's Cake
=============
gangagal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/captains-cake/reviews/1397043,"“If you see Captain's Cake...TRY IT! This unique strain is both beautiful and powerful. 

A 70/30 indica lean, this strain's sativa shines when smoked in low doses. When smoked in higher doses, this will provide for a cerebral body high (if that makes sense). 

Last night I cheefed a 1g joint of cake after dinner and felt like it was laced with coke or some crazy sh*t. I was manic almost as if I had taken stimulants. ...”"
rhomastyder420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/captains-cake/reviews/1390882,"“Capatain's Cake  is a heavyweight strain for heavyweights. You can smell it's OG parents on her; faint earthy pine with woody undertones. On the exhale you can really taste the GSC; reminiscent of one of those old school Christmas cookies. I almost forgot the best part: the high. It's a buzz that crushes anxiety under its heavy handed euphoria. This bud is potent enough that you only need to smoke a few hits and tast...”"

RoxyShadow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/captains-cake/reviews/1368042,"“Thank you!! Finally something that works, I feel like I can't actually get that silly Stoney feeling with many strains since I have been medicating , I think my tolerance has skyrocket but just smoked some CC and yay a much needed midday couch lick has set in.”"
jbass89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/captains-cake/reviews/1574182,"“I medicate daily, about two hours before I go to sleep. My goal is to dissociate from my workday; I want the stress, anxiety, and hypervigilance to stop, otherwise I am destined to a night of repeating nightmares. Most frequently these nightmares involve some sort of futile attempt to finish a task. I try, I fail. I try again, I fail again. All night long. For me, success in medicating is determined by how well I bre...”"

Not great for competitive scissors competitions, but really effective for a staring off into space with a smile competition.  I m gonna go try to watch some crazy crap on YouTube and pass out.  It will be fun no matter what. Thank you Capt.”"

AncientWood,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/captains-cake/reviews/1350285,"“great strain. Got this on a whim at my dispensary. It was a new arrival when i got there. Have to say i was not disappointed. It breaks up nice, has a great smell, and awesome high. Smoked a cone and was feeling great. When i smoked a few bongs a couple hours later, i was feeling no pain, and no stress. Highly recommend if you can find her hanging around.”"

It has this very pungent lemon/citrus aroma with that sweet Girl Scout cookie smell with earthy batter undertones. Taste like lemon sugar cookies and has a very stimulating energetic sativa high when the effects first kick in then settles into a relaxed body high but not couch locking. Perfect for anyt...”"

But this!! One bowl pack of Captain's Cake and I was toasted!! I did get giggly, and the taste is amazing!!”"

Disectotron,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/captains-cake/reviews/1378549,"“My favorite strain at the moment, it's a nice strong strain that still gets me baked off a small amount even with my high tolerance. This strain also helps my chronic fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia so I can function and tackle the day. Cake is also perfect if you wanna binge watch movies or game for hours. For me it makes me get lost in music and playing music. If you have the chance pick up a 1/4 or two of Cake.”"

estproph,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/captains-cake/reviews/1357099,"“Tried about 5 hits off a 1g roll last night. Now I know what couchlock really means. Damn but it was nice to sit back and relax! Made me feel nice and fuzzy all over, and my arthritic knee pain which has been my constant companion for years - GONE. I did get paranoid during the initial first rush (that happens to me often) but it did go away aftet a while and I was left with serious warm fuzzies.”"
TokersSecretStash,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/captains-cake/reviews/1447090,"“This strain is amazing and I think the perfect candidate for a day time smoke. be careful though it is a very stimulating strain,I tend to do a lot of cleaning after dabbing some rosin of this strain. the rosin yeilds were also pretty awesome,they aren't the highest yeilders but the teepee profiles this strain provides extract really easily with the rosin method. I strongly recomend this strain to those who smoke a l...”"
Davidpnin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/captains-cake/reviews/1705889,"“Honestly, this strain gets me STONED unlike any other strain.  I have a super high tolerance and have been smoking for years but this strain really gets me stupid, detached and spacey stoned like when I first smoked weed.  It's a weird strain because it's so stoney but I'm falling in love with it the more I smoke.”"

Definitely a fantastic smoke if your looking to unwind and loosen up while keeping you in the mood to conversate or get a low energy activity going. Personally if I was going to run a marathon on Netflix or break in a new game this strain would be the move.”"

I use cannabis recreationally but also to treat generalized anxiety disorder and OCD invasive thoughts. Captains Cake is just what the doctor ordered.

Hits with the same strength as a Granddaddy Purple or Blue Dream. A stay home strain. If I had been out in public, it would be obvious to everyone that I was baked. A little jittery as I write this but not bad given the high THC. I have anxiety issues so have to be sensitive to the high THC strains. Body is almost...”"
