Alien Dawg

You just passed your spaceship driver’s test, and mom and pop alien are finally letting you take the spaceship out on your own for the first time. The galaxy is yours. This is what freedom feels like.  You can go anywhere you want now! “Don’t go to the Dabula Quadrant, it’s too intense for the ship.” “Yes, ma.” You can go ALMOST anyw...”"

As I got home I smoked about 2 grams of this throughout a timeframe of 2 hours or so. Very relaxing calm high. As soon as you smoke this you feel the pressure set in behind your eyes before it locks you to the couch. The high lasts for a while also. Probably about 2 hours. Very good strain to just kick back and watch a movie. Medicinally I would suggest thi...”"

I'm sensitive to weed, so just one or two hits does the job. cool thing is if you don't smoke a shit load at once, it's a beautiful feeling,  then you feel it wearing off a bit and just have a few more hits, it's not overwhelming that way.

Jallbo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-dawg/reviews/1385211,"“Alien Dawg is one of my favourite strains. Alien Dawg is especially great for stress relief, and while it presents a heavy, yet relaxing body-high, it also brings forth euphoric moments and eases muscle/joint pain. After 1~2 Hours in, I felt significantly more relaxed and was ready for some sleep or felt like  taking it easy in a comfortable area.”"
