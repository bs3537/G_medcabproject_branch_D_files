Swiftylad,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alpine-star/reviews/1382301,"“This jumped up to my number 1 strain. For someone who has depression I recommend this strain, it is a pick me upper, a mood changer! Great for day time smoking!  Great for when you need to get things done! Also, I was sore from a workout, and the soreness from my workout went away while I was medicated! I hope this was helpful for someone! Great strain! Alpine OG”"

HornsTheBoy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alpine-star/reviews/1351926,"“Not the best strain if you are a regular smoker. Yes, it gives you a light and happy high, but not good enough. A good option would be OG Kush, no doubt.”"

I was initially told this was a sativa, but I received it so fast before I had to go to work I just took a fat glob and went to work. Man, this stuff is Tahoe OG x Sensi Star and let me tell you the Tahoe OG is very dominant. Great indica though, put me out when I went home later.”"

Without a doubt you know you hit the jackpot. Grinding is best sonce the strand is super sticky and will leave your fingers sticky as well!

RedDeath999,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alpine-star/reviews/1639164,"“This strain puts me in a very analytical state. Great for writing. Good head high and puts me very aware of my surroundings; aware to the point where I panic at some moments. Pretty psychedelic actually. Smoking some right now... and that's my experience with Alpine OG.”"
