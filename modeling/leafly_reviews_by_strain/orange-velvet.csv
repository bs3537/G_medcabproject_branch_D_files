dickdaniels,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1359963,"“Just picked up an eighth from Altitude in Co Springs and this stuff is amazing.  Definitely getting the smooth orange smell and a little skunkiness in the background.  Was able to get a lot of cleaning done around the place and felt great doing so.  Smoked about 3 bowls over a 3 hour period and it was perfect.  Never 
once did I feel sluggish or unmotivated.  Will be picking up more of this rare gem!”"
shoghon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1067078,"“Lovely oranges notes and a citrus sensation on the nose. Burning produces a light and yet subtly fragrant scent. The taste has feeling along the back and sides of the mouth. Defined orange aftertaste. Light easy to breathe smoke (wb). After five there is a happy sense and not too much headlines. 

Hungry after 30 minutes.”"
Savage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1067067,"“Good mellow daytime med.  Also very good for relieving stress.  
  This sample was soil grown and acquired from a legal, medical source.  Very pungent citrus odor, very defined when vaped.  Anxiety can occur with large doses, like many sativa dominant strains.”"
DayTripper7711,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1373430,"“One of the most flavorful and delicious strains I've ever tried; OV is the KING of the "Orange Family" of strains. The terpene profile is out of this world! The flavor of Orange Cream is an unmistakable hallmark of a great batch. I generally don't care for "Orange" varieties of cannabis but Orange Velvet was the exception.”"

Migraine pain 5-6, nausea 4-5 when I medicated round 1930 or so. Body high hits ya 1st (in bout 5 min). Another 5 min & the head buzz kicks ya! Body high perfect; pain/nausea gone. Head high strong but not too much. NO ANXIETY/PARANOIA (an absolute must). Made me energetic & creative. High lasted bout 3 hours. When the high started to wear off I cra...”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1374826,"“If you're the kind of consumer that's all about the smell & taste, this ones perfect for you.  I was hesitant to buy it since it says in the description it isn't very strong. One day it was on sale so I had to try it.  Taste like orange creamsicle & smells like it.”"
boycadence,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1067070,"“This is my jam. It's sweet and has a great taste. Vaporizing is great with this strain. It's perfect before work because I stay clear-headed.”"

HarveySmokes2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1373051,"“OV takes away any stressful situation you may have. It is very relaxing and very smooth. I've learned that not too many people love the citrus flavor but, I can assure you smoking a blunt of this amazingly flavorful strain will knock you off your feet and leave you feeling like nothing really matters, at all. I miss you OV.”"

TallOrange,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1361271,"“I know someone with this one and it's definitely a sativa. It's not a hybrid. It's very much a true breed. It foxtails easily with adequate light and has giant thin leaves with larger than usual internode space. Less like cones, more like golf balls and icicles, larger at the top rather than the base. Still smells orange creamy.”"

SpaceCoyote,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1204249,"“My current favorite! Wonderfully, blissfully euphoric :-)
Hard to find, at least in Colorado, I wish I'd bought more when I had the chance.”"

bondster45,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1067083,"“I was skeptical before buying this strain since i noticed the low amount of reviews on here, but once i tried it i realized that this is one of the best strains i ever had.”"
jimmyinspazzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1416175,"“Flower with a unique nose to it being tangy, yet extremely smooth leaving a lingering taste of orange. Buzz does not come on heavy or get any heavier over time it just is mellow. So if a heavy hitter is desired this is not the strain, but if a wonderful taste coupled with chill vibe works wrap yourself in some Orange Velvet. Very middle ground hybrid leaning slightly sativa. Slightly effective for migraine relief, bu...”"

JayneMansfield,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1310679,"“This herb is amazing! It smells Devine! 
It tastes like it's smells. 
The high is so chill, helps me with my muscle soreness, back spasms and gives me energy to do my chores still.”"

massweediaink,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1771520,"“It's too bad this lightweight sativa doesn't get more love; the terpene profile is absolutely off the charts. It's like smoking the rind of a clementine orange, without the nastiness that actually smoking a clementine rind would create. It would be perfect for someone new to cannabis; experienced users might prefer something with a bit (ok, a lot) more kick, but if you're looking for a maintenance burn, the flavor ca...”"
hanzbe420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1067081,"“This says its a hybrid but on this pheno it foxtailed. So i think this batch has more sativa dominance over the indica. The smell is like pure orange citrus, beautiful, heavenly best smelling in a long time terpenes i have ever smelled!!! Its definitely genetic. I keep all my favorite buds in 1 big jar and no matter what this bud out smells them all, and never loses its smell. Like say for instance another bud will o...”"

ColoradoToker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1187569,"“It's more of a face high than a head high..   Smells like b.o. You'll get dizzy if you smoke too much! Potent, uplifting and long-lasting.”"

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1067071,"“Super tasty, wonderful aroma, nice clean high, the kind that gets me up and out instead of lounging around the house.  Not the strongest strain out there, but rare enough that if you find it's worth getting!!”"
DanAshFan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1392148,"“More than a novelty strain. Yes, it tastes and smells like oranges but it is wonderful for many different applications. It kills pain better than the Leafly description gives it credit for. It produces wonderful euphoria and warm thoughts, and really does a number on depression. In fact, in my experience it alleviates depression better than any other strain. It just has a knack for getting your brain to secrete all t...”"

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1067069,"“Smells great and works great, a nice light happy high. Definitely something you could smoke before doing active things. I smoked a tiny bit before work and it did its thing, could have lasted longer but i only smoked a tiny bowl. oh and super crystally.”"

macneb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1218205,"“Good citrus flavor and mellow buzz. It has a good balance of THC/CBD which provides a mild high with many medical benefits. Barely got distracted from my chores while toking this one:) I hear its rare and I'm glad I got mine on Oct. 1st in Oregon.”"
TallOrange,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1145590,"“The high is the most euphoric I've had. Every girl I ever smoked this with, their skirts were visibly wet by the moment they smelt it, with their panties dropped 10 seconds after their first bowl. I've never seen anything like it. If a "kush cologne" could exist, I'd make it out of this. Wow does it smell good. This strain is also the hardiest and hardest to detect by sniffing little narcs near you.”"
JohnBoysReviews,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1152110,"“A 50/50 hybrid that delivers the best of both worlds. Helps relive nausea and light pain with a slight slowing of the motor skills. But you keep a sharp head. Has a great citrus taste. I did not enjoy the flower but I loved the concentrate.”"

blackbird,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-velvet/reviews/1397307,"“Yes, this strain does taste like oranges, especially in a vaporizer. This medicine worked best for me in small (1 to 2) doses. It can be relaxing without a drousy feeling. In higher doses, I found that my short term memory is impaired, while feeling (believing) that I am clearheaded. So, I do not prefer this strain over others. However, I know of at least one other person who doesn't have the side effect that I just ...”"
