The aroma in itself is enough to know this is some very dank herb. Pungeant, skunky, sweet and hashy aromatic terpenes penetrate the air.

AaronD,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pink-kush/reviews/1413297,"“Awesome hybrid strain. Buds are dense and covered in crystals, with small pink strands inside. Perfect for sleep, pain, anxiety, or just chilling and reading. At first, the high was uplifting and slightly energetic, with the giggles, bad. After about 20 minutes of reading, I am now stuck to my chair. Nice head high, followed by a slow rolling body stone. The best of both worlds!”"
