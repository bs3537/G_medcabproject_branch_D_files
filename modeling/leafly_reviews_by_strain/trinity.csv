The effects are unlike any other kind of weed i've had yet. Every once in a while a weed comes along that feels completely different from all the rest, this one is it.

It's a great "get up and go" strain; perfect for mornings. The most appealing thing about this strain for me however is that despite giving me a very strong, energizing, arousing Sativa effect; I don't get any Anxiety or Paranoia! That's a MUST FOR ME; as I have an anxiety disorder which some strong Sativa strains...”"

But overall  I personally wouldn't get this again,  maybe a G of flower? ?”"
