Sublime has been a savior to my overworked and overstressed head. The pain reliving effects buzz through my head in such a positive way, casting easy going vibrations for a nice hour...but hold the phones people , the best part of this strain my friend is that the high is so manageable . This doesn't take you on a head trip full of Aztec Wisdom and whisp...”"
WestAmericans,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sublime/reviews/1358197,"“I had a gram of Sublime for two months before getting around to trying it. I suppose that was a good thing, however, because it kicked my top favorite right down to sea level.  I'd be vaporizing a lot more than usual if I knew about Sublime back when I initially purchased it.. I really like the mainly sativa hybrids -- Golden Goat, Mamasan, NYC Diesel -- and if Sublime fits that category, then it definitely ranks as ...”"
BJW,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sublime/reviews/1385908,"“Interesting hybrid strain that is all over Colorado in various forms - the smell is pretty unique; I'd describe it as a 'deep' fruit, wine, old sweet grapes and half-rotten bananas.

The high is very 50/50 sativa/indica (mind/body) but the most redeeming trait is the happy/uplifted feel of the high while...”"

Vid-szhite,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sublime/reviews/1620357,"“Tried it once and it became an instant favorite. Very flavorful, and the high it gives is a nice manageable high that won't leave you sucked into Narnia. I wouldn't exactly go for a drive while on this stuff, but it's a good one to puff up when you're about to play a board game or hang out with friends.

The flavors this thing has are what keep me coming back to it. It tastes a bit like pine, cinnamon, and sweet herb...”"

Branderschang,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sublime/reviews/1257280,"“A very mellow high. It hits me lightly but leaves me feeling like my brain is floating out of my head. It's taste wasn't anything sharp or noticeable. To me it tasted like an old basement filled with books, but good books, ones you've wanted to read your whole life. I'm influenced by it as I write this and music sounds just as good as ever with it. But you don't have to take my word for it.”"

MedicalIncredible,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sublime/reviews/1376921,"“2.5 Stars 
Another "cool name" strain that does not live up to its name. 
Sublime was a great band, but this strain is not "Sublime". 
Nothing wrong with it, but the name implies something extra special, it not.”"
