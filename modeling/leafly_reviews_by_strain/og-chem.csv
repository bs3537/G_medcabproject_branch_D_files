SkullyOrganics,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1416254,"“Chemmy to the core. Don't come looking for that OG gas/lemon pledge smell. The cut I smoked smelled predominantly of chemdawg and tasted like it too. First time smokers keep in mind this shit sends you into stratosphere when it comes to a trippy head high. Best smoke for a hike through the woods or up a mountain, this is trippy "dig into nature" weed to the very core. Rip a bowl, go for a long hike and wait for the c...”"

The reason I'm writing another review is that this has become my first choice in daytime strains. First off the thing I love is the availability of consistent, high quality, bud. I'm sure other people have mentioned them but Grow Op Farms (aka Phat Panda) has got growing this strain down to a perfect science, It's amazing the smell and taste who ever first came up w...”"

Beebe420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1414185,"“Have to agree with Tippydogg66, the Phat Panda cut I got was off the hook. Hopefully people outside of Wa. can come across this Pheno. This particular batch is 30.42% THC, 0.39% CBD. I can pick up both the OG & Chem equally, one doesn't overpower the other to me. This is a marriage built to last as long as its effects.”"

Uplifting and relaxing without any sedative effect and a blast of euphoria. Puts me in a clearheaded good mood, ready for anything, even if its nothing. For me, seems right at that edge of potency where I can function at 100% while still being completely blasted. 4.5/5.”"

It might just be the batch I got, but it's not very dense and it burns fast. After a few hits, you can feel your heartbeat and your arms tingle. It's definitely the mind racing, jittery kind of high. If that's what you like, puff away. It just wasn't my cup of tea.”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1607269,"“A good staple by phat panda in WA. This is a nice all day strain, I recommend this for getting normal. Og chem isn’t complex. Smoke is not mild but not over the top. Looks like a classic strain. It smells like dried seaweed. It gets me relaxed and feeling like bill withers is in my head singing lovely day.

Highly recommend, as I continue to get it.”"

We were baked (and I mean BAKED), but still able to function with enough precision to do things like bake a cake.

If you want something to relax your body and let the mind roam, give it a go.”"
Krendle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1308291,"“Absolutely amazing for a nighttime smoke. Wouldn't recommend trying to do anything too intense while consuming. Tingly as hell. Fun and euphoric.”"
inditiva0,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1318813,"“Super dank taste of diesel/chemical. Instant head rush with creeping body effects. Very smooth inhale, but if the exhale doesn't make you cough, you're not doing it right. Long lasting effects.”"

AJGOLDY,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1294722,"“I like the pre-rolls of the OG Chem. Very god flavor, reminds me of something naturally grown and really fruity. You feel really happy and I personally will talk for an hour straight. I've liked this for hiking a lot too. Does not make you tired. Will continue to buy.”"
RobbyBryant12,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1301462,"“This is a great strain that works immediately. I absolutely love it. So does my girlfriend. I would recommend this to a lot of friends for pain and depression it works.”"
JloSmokey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1309895,"“Stout hits after this smoke ...sharp pungent, chemical diesel aroma and taste..Keeps you moving, Awesome energetic affect!”"
GhettoChick40,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1329018,"“Awesome high, great for pain, energy, and more. This is 1 of my top five strains I'll definitely get this again.”"
JamieDarling,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1217358,"“I have to smoke a lot of this before I feel anything. It makes my body feel good for a while but it doesn't last long. I hate that I will have to go through a whole jar before I can move on! I will never buy this again. I also don't like the taste at all.”"
buddymac28,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1256399,"“Great strain, with good balance between body and mind. Very relaxing and very tingly. Really smooth hit, not expansive, easy on the lungs. Classic Chemmy taste, rubber tires and diesel/fuel taste. Doesn't produce very good vapor and have found this strain can make me pretty dizzy.”"
luv2toke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1387308,"“A little bit of incest is going on with this strain as OG is a descendant of Chemdog, and now they've been back-crossed to create a delicious and powerful Indica? Yeah that's what it supposedly is, but it just reminds me of a pinier Chemdog in taste and effect.   8.5/10”"
LoriQ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1387309,"“A nice taste but   it's mild. 
A nice body high, maybe. 
Not much of a head change.”"
demis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1209104,"“10/10”"
rizlo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-chem/reviews/1382988,"“i live in ellensburg for a year and last 5-6 different og chem i tried was no good. that's weird cuz in los angeles i'm sure chem og is really strong stuff..guess it's about areas”"
