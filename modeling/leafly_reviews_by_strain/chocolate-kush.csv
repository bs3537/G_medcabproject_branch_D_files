derick98,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1388010,"“this strain feels amazing , body wise and opens up a night of relaxation and serenity. popcorn , music and friends become mind bending and a new high for pleasantry . fantastic.”"
JM-Sparrow,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1388367,"“This strain is fine.
It's probably best suited for new smokers who are looking for a stereotypical, body lock high. For more experienced smokers, it's a fine, mild high. I wouldn't pass on this if someone offered me a hit. This just isn't something I would keep in my usual stash.”"

JackFlash92,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1391814,"“Wow!! Pure euphoric feeling!! Nice earthy tasting bud which left me relaxed, creative, focused and euphoric. Probably the best strain I've had in recent months”"
mbressler13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1389802,"“Got some from Tj's organics. Amazing indica. Will put you to sleep if your not careful. Personal fav of my wife. Nice smooth smoke and of course has a hint of chocolate.”"
weblicated,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1610763,"“I have struggled with spinal stenosis and generalized anxiety and all the manifestations for years. I discovered that TRUE Indica's relieve me of all symptoms and bring me to a total normalized pain free state. I can tell within 2-3 hits if it is a true blue Indica, and Choc Kush or at least the line I procured is a true blue Indica. I am able to consume a large amount with no issues. Choc Kush produced a combination...”"
Jambandfan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1442103,"“Hella body lock. It's great for night time or going out with friends if you need to remain mentally sharp. I was in bed last night watching tv and couldn't feel my body. It was great. There isn't too much of a head high, for me, at least, which is kinda disappointing, but it's an India after all. Would recommend for anyone trying to straight up relax. Good shit.

 As always, Peace, Love, & Purp”"
nbarefoot,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1381193,"“I got this strain while trimming for a guy a while back. He gave me a baggie-full in return. It was the bottom of the plant. I mean, the tiniest popcorn nugs and stray half-nugs. The grower had obviously not done a fantastic job on the curing angle. That being said, it was still a fantastic smoke. Very relaxing and good for sleep.”"
lilbp420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1350468,"“This strain is one of my go to choices for medication.  The indica is strong in this one.  Do far ive only used this in a fairly stable wax (easy to work with, not super sticky, not thin oil, looks like olive yellow/green baby poop) very easy to work with compared with some shatter I've used in the past.

I have not tried this strain in any other form then wax (Company: MPX) so i cant compare to the flower but i can ...”"
crudemood,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1591001,"“Although this is an indica, I didn't get sleepy right away.  I felt a little of a sativa high at the beginning but no paranoia.  Near the end of the high it was time for sleep.  Great strain to just chill out and watch some Netflix. I'm prone to paranoia but this strain did not bring that out. :)”"
marleysmagic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1661765,"“ı love this strain lol”"
Dankeffect420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1355485,"“Nice relaxed body high, while still keeping your mind clear enough that you can still focus on tasks at hand. Take a few more puffs to slip into a nice calming high.”"
syiixs24,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1388148,"“very relaxed mellow high that lasts, bought an ounce great for smoking when stressed or just need to chill strong smooth body high overall great bud”"
laysketchupchips,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1534346,"“Nice strain for the price. I found this to be a medium to heavy smoke with a classic kush taste. It is a relaxing high, and I got a lil hungry. It also relieved the back pain had from work. I use this later afternoon/evening.”"
Longboard12,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1534271,"“Heavy...with a full body relaxing liftoff. Makes you want to just sit down and enjoy all your senses :)”"
sirmarijuana,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1333876,"“This strain doesn't really taste of chocolate, but rather pungent sweetness - dank either way 😂 the high was something different... Felt extremely happy and euphoric. Can't stop thinking and laughing 👌🏻 very head heavy high. Feels great, but the heaviness is really tiring 😂”"
SkinTan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1713197,"“The first hit gave me Forest Whitaker eye and a slight case of the YMCA's. It was roasty like a coffee given to you fresh by Pablo in the fields of Honduras. You give him a few dollars and hope it helps, we all worry about you and your family, Pablo. The high was smooth and soft like a water bed bean bag chair. I very much so enjoy smoking this weed.”"
JoshLoc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1373994,"“This is the ideal kush for daytime for me. Love everything about it, super social buzz. Only problem is I never come across it.”"
Goochinatr,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1710702,"“About as chill and relaxing as indica strains could get. Was able to get lost in my thoughts and just enjoy the moment. Gave off nice psychedelic vibes.”"

Great for a sore body and the head high is clear and uplifting. Love it”"

AWadd618,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1515088,"“For my tastes, this was perfect. A nice, mellow body high with a functional mental buzz. Some small hints what I call the TJ's (Tired-Jollies), which was similar to a mood-enhancer/lift but with a bit of silliness in there. Not the cheapest option but between effect, tastes, and potency I loved it.”"

NutFather,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1431540,"“looked good, smelled good, and had a true indica body high... but this strain tasted like chocolate if you took all the good out of chocolate; it tasted like dirty dishwater; it tasted like moldy powdered donuts. will not be purchasing again”"

loco4pakalolo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1306550,"“Smells like minty cocoa...smooth taste with a slightly minty finish with my vape. I took 3 hits and was overwhelmed with euphoria! Dancing and grooving to the Talking Heads for over an hour. Stimming to the  iTunes visualizer afterwards. Good, simple-minded fun! I found it hard to contain myself in the beginning, as I was doing dancing laps inside my house! This strain would be great at a party or an outdoor concert....”"

Leaflyfan2016,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-kush/reviews/1303971,"“One of my top 10 strains now. 
One of my favorite strains at the moment. It's one of the smoothest hitting weed out there. I thought that it was gonna be couch weed at first but it was actually very uplifting and energizing. I was super alert and had that nice feeling behind the eyes without looking super Asian. Also loved the sweet taste it had and the draw was very nice. I didn't cough one time smoking this weed.
