Furrow,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/trix/reviews/1470263,"“Giving this strain a 5/5 solely because of the taste. Recently just got this guy in live resin form and you can taste heavy lime terps with grapefruit and a hint of coconut! Seriously probably the tastiest strain I have smoked. The high is immediate and clear headed as well.”"
JamesPBrown,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/trix/reviews/1356669,"“This strain is the most beautiful sweet tasting bud I've ever smoked! I really love this strain. For ratings on taste I'll give it an 9 out of 10 and as for looks it's a 9 out of 10 as well! This bus smells just like fruity pebbles! It reminds me of fruity pebbles and trix cereal by the coloration and smell”"
