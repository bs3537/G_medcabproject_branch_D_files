Euphoria to the max. Easy to focus, almost makes you a genius. After a few bits and 20 minutes you will pass out! I have yet to try it in the morning or on a stressful day time. But it's GREAT for night. EEEEEEUPHORIA”"

I’ve followed the guidance of my local hydroponic store and use their recommended products for feeding etc... I grew this strain and wow, the results blew me away!  Not only was the yield amazing, the quality of the buds surpassed my expectations. I grew white widow last year, which did ok but the high wasn’t as strong as I had hoped.  Fearing this again I was nervous...”"

Aizance,https://www.leafly.com/indica/crown-royale/reviews/1352187,"“I don't know what states the flavors, but this is the most flowery tasting strain I have ever had. I feel super relaxed and chill after just smoking one bong bowl. I will update this after smoking more. I have now smoked a Kiefer layered 2nd bowl, and I am in the absolutely best movie watching high. I'm perfectly content to sit down and watch a movie with friends. overall very relaxed and chill high.”"

Relieved my back pain, head pain, neck pain, generally all muscle pain and a headache. My body was finally relaxed. 
My mind could discuss stressful situations from a different perspective. 
Got really sleepy 2-3 hour...”"

DocGreenhaze,https://www.leafly.com/indica/crown-royale/reviews/1656433,"“Crown Royal strain has a pungent sweet fruity earthy taste with no major aftertaste, the effects are seemingly quick starting with a very euphoric cerebral high relaxing my shoulders and back I started smoking today and my pain was at an 8 with peaks into the 9s, I feel almost as if my gallbladder is swelling again and maybe a kidney stone so this bowl was very welcome as well as being on the phone with GoDaddy for o...”"
