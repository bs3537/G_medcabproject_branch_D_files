Used the crafty vaporizer with less than a gram. Shared between 3 people. Had to pack another bowl after about an hour in half. Vape quality very smooth. Earthy in taste. Didn't noticed any fruit flavors. 


Setting. 
I was at home with ambient music. Lights turn down with a comfortable sofa. It did not feel like gorilla glue where I was glued to the couch. 

Food. 
Consumed a sweeten coffee beverage from 8...”"

Recreational Weed isnt nearly as good and doesn't last as long. super sour kush was an ven balance of happy and spacey with a 
chill relaxed mood  but not couch locked. I am pie eyed and stupidly grinning.”"

This 50/50 hybrid from Emerald Triangle Cannabis, that combines well-known strains Blueberry, Sour Diesel, and OG Kush with Lost Coast OG. Its overall taste is immediately Sour Blueberry.  I am a Sour strain lover and this newest strain from my garden is really one of my new fave strains in my current selection.”"

Very OG and VERY pungent and lemony, with a pleasant aftertaste. The sample I received was very high testing on the THC, but even still I was impressed with the effect and speed of onset.
