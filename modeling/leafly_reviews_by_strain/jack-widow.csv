discosunshine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-widow/reviews/1246552,"“Perfect balanced Sativa hybrid, not too stimulating but still puts me in a positive, relaxed mood. Less energetic, creative and talkative than Sativas too- better for relaxing.”"
gongbaoshaun,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-widow/reviews/1202829,"“In my neck of the woods here in Oregon we call this strain Jack White. I love it and have been cultivating it for a few years. It is like a happy punch to the head that can keep you up very late if you smoke too much, at least mine is that way.”"
Lizzy_delSol,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-widow/reviews/1064426,"“Depends on if a lot: it helps me relax and sleep and I have bad anxiety and insomnia, a little: makes me happy, goofy, stress free.. Able to get up and do anything I want.”"
