bardahl4,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1361076,"“O.K. this is a real good strain for doing chores, working in the garden or sitting around a kitchen table with friends and talking till mid-night or beyond.  I like making art while smoking this strain.  It sets my creative juices flowing and gives me energy enough to attack my work with vigor and joy.   I've been smoking for nearly 50 years but until recently had  little experience with this quality of smoke.  So I'...”"
notasmoker86,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1394262,"“This is an excellent strain for daytime use!! I originally went into my dispensary asking for a cartridge of harlequin since it helps me focus and eases my back pain. She was out and suggested Bettie instead- she said it's a mix of jack herer and... something. Anyway, I have ADHD, back pain, muscle spasms , and anxiety- this took the edge off my anxiety   in one hit, and over the next half hour I felt my mood improve...”"

Definenlty makes the sense of touch enhanced so arousal with this strain. I also felt like creating something regardless what it may be with focus behind it. Thanks Mindrite in Portland”"
DayTripper7711,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1378734,"“One of the best Terpene profiles I'll ever come across.”"
Unbalancedchef,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1357662,"“Great all day kind of smoke. Doesn't zone you out or make you panic. Just turns the "Dial of Life" up a notch or two from where you currently are.”"
DavidAquarius,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1385116,"“Nice taste, a bit spicy with a pine/woodsy overtone.  I got mine at Evergreen Market.  Liberty Reach has never failed me so if some of their stock is available, pick it up!”"
CarmanSanDiego425,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1619007,"“I picked this up in a vape at Local Roots in Everett during their 420 sale. I wasn't familiar with the strain but it was took good of a sale to pass up. After reading the reviews on here I decided it was probably best to save this one for chore day. I spent the last 7 hours puffing this vape and cleaning my house. I struggle with pain and fatigue but sativa dominants tend to make me a bit too anxious, I found this to...”"

sullyp333,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1206109,"“One memorable strain. made me unsociable but it gave me a great relaxed feeling where I sat in deep thought. Unique taste and very dense. Will buy again but it's not the best stuff I've tried.”"
Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1361269,"“not too intense..7 out of 10 mid range high. but killed my painful cramping in my legs and gave me a wry smile. it wont make you talk to yourself, but you may enjoy a quick chat. and a stale fruit loops smell with herbal notes.”"

Ebab-wel,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1669477,"“Bettie Page is the most balanced strain I have ever smoked. The taste was quite good with tones of nut and wood and a somewhat sweet finished on the exhale. The high started with an Indica driven relaxation that nearly put me in the couch. Within 10 minutes the couch lock did not take hold and gave way to a mild muscle retaliation. As the stronger indica effects faded, Bettie's sativa side kicked in big time. My mind...”"
SeatownHaze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1216291,"“Smoked this for my birthday earlier this year. Very nice, calming effect that had me spaced out and feeling celebratory.”"
cgajardo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1358496,"“I love the high from this Bettie Page. It puts me in a good mood, everything is fine (it lowers my anxiety) and I feel fully functional, physical and intellectually.”"
Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1312845,"“sexy smell of berries and pine, with a little funk(cheese maybe), tiny hints of citrus or diesel? Top 5 scent wise, tasty.
Stoned without being too Spacey, definitely pain relief, all muscles and joints feel mellow. energy is laid back and controllable speed wise, just maybe lacking a steering wheel.”"
PluckyAndDetermined,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1205558,"“Gave me a lot of unfocused energy. This would be a great strain if you ever find yourself stuck in a swarm of flies armed only with a tongue depressor or on a game show where you had to slap a bunch of panels at once (Vanna White might be more fun on this). Probably won't smoke this again.”"
sharoncox420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1375219,"“This is one of my new favorite strains! The smell is amazing and it really packs a punch! I "highly" recommend it! :)”"

digopheliadug,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1361679,"“Recommended by my local budtender, I imbibed via cartridge/vape. I felt social, talkative, lowered inhibitions. It hits me a lot like alcohol but without the depressant effect; higher energy. Interesting note: noticeably made food taste better.”"
cturne04,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1588349,"“Using it as I type. So far so good. I have not had the flower. I'm using the vape cartridge with my Vuber pen. Taste is pleasant. Different, not earthy, pine or bitter in any way. Kinda sweet, but not fruity. Hits right away for sure.”"
Kawaiicookie86,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1395332,"“Interesting flavor profile, potent,  fun. 
The taste is reminiscent of Cheetos and I gotta say,  pretty darn good! Loaded one bowl for a wake and bake, with three big tokes and BLAMMO! My tolerance is pretty high so it's nice to find bud that packs a wallop. The feeling is a pleasant, buzzy,happy, spacey, hopeful and contemplative. I'm always ready for a nap due to fatigue so you can't trust my couchlock effect senso...”"

coolkidjd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1495016,"“this strain is delicious. fruity smelling flower, rich in flavor. well cured, but still a TAD harsh. overall, pretty chill high, and delicious tasting bud!”"
jimdaughterrun,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1219881,"“Had the oil it was like GSC on crack. Head high for hours with a active body high that had me cleaning the house and writing Christmas cards! Lol”"
DanAshFan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bettie-page/reviews/1497141,"“It feels a lot like Purple Train Wreck- mental zing and spacy- but with a lot more energy and a lot less fun. This is one of those pointless strains that breeders create “just because” and then slap a sexy name on them for marketing. Tinnitus sufferers should avoid this strain. I thought Bettie Page was supposed to be arousing and be great for inflammation? Not in my case. Didn’t do anything for my Meniere’s disease ...”"
