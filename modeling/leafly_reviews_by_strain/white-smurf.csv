So I am going to give you the best review as i remember it has been about 15-20yr. It has a smoke peppermint smoke taste inhaling. A hint of fuity i think maybe oragne with huge skunk smell behind it. It's flavor profile is almost just like L.S.D. but this smelt more skunky but maybe it was grown better then i grow, I had this in coffee shop around 2003 o...”"

Cirys,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-smurf/reviews/1299562,"“Definitely a creeper, takes about 15 to 20 minutes to hit full force and you don't really realize it's hitting you. I smoked from a bong and it had a minty and very earthy taste to it. Made me really giggly, content and happy.”"
Huntron3000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-smurf/reviews/1254187,"“Not a half bad strain. Smoking from an average bong, it takes a few hits to really feel it's full effect. definitely a creeper with a light punch. great if you're socializing, or doing anything that might still require some focus. its very easy to burn back a quarter of WS if you're not paying attention”"
