Suzy Q
=============
Cmunz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1376948,"“Tested about 18% cbd less than 1% thc. Aroma was amazingly appealing of sweet skunky pine. Buds were somewhat loose and leafy compared to what i'm used to, but harvesting a little prematurely is a technique growers use to maximize cbd ratios. I don't have any serious pathology so cannot comment on the effects against  pain, spasms so forth. To me the "high" was more of an equalizing and calming of the psyche, like a ...”"
emilymarsha11,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1415050,"“my favorite CBD strain. I got an 18:1 ratio (CBD:THC) and it's perfect for taming my anxiety while still keeping me awake, and for helping me focus.”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1428004,"“Since it’s a CBD strain and not THC heavy, the effects are minimal. More in line with cold medicine, but the most notable aspect is a nice mood elevation. Went from feeling gross and hungover to rosy and upbeat. Almost even forces a smile on your face. Dilated pupils and wide vision is reminiscent of Jack Herer. Pleasantly trippy mental state hovers around and adds a fun bent to experiencing your environment. Vastly ...”"
vsanjuan99,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1395597,"“Had foot surgery, super painful, did not like oxycodone so tried this. Amazing pain relief with no high, just a relaxed calm sense of well being.”"
GenYHippie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1304642,"“First time with this strain. Very pleased wiped out my nearly 2 day headache within 10 minutes.  Didn't take much, mild flavor no unpleasant brain/body rush just relief.”"
againstflea,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1369681,"“Labeled at 17% CBD, 1% THC. Very relaxing, kept anxiety to a minimum when I left the house. Clear-headed, no paranoia. Can't wait to mix it with some otherwise excellent sativas to combat the side effects.”"
jaywoodrow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1361639,"“Great CBD. Don't look to get high with this one though. 
A good hit is like taking 1200mg of ibuprofen. 
Fantastic strain. 
Thanks for producing this. Wish I could find seeds.

poopsicle8888,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1648405,"“Very good strain. Has more of a honey/sweet and flowery smell and taste I found. Very mellow and smooth. While it has a little bit too much THC for my likings, I enjoyed the high. Unexpectedly sleepy, but mostly very relaxed, while also being a clear headed buzz.”"
Mendoper,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1358248,"“Great for chronic pain. Period.”"
coolson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1382343,"“Flower I bought had no THC in it. Only thing that helped my shoulder pain. Was able to use it and work, with no head high or fuzziness. I also really enjoy the flavor and smell of this strain (used in a vaporizer).”"
MasterCheef420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1462047,"“Easy to grow, very rewarding, changes the common perspective on how cannabis interacts with the body. Clears the mind, cuts anxiety, provides body high, and relaxes.”"
katherpop,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1358246,"“I have been looking for a bud that I could use during the day to keep my back pain in check and I found it with Suzy Q. I got almost no "high" from it but did feel like I had cotton stuffed in my ears and that was about all. I am thrilled to have such a high CBD strain in my medicine chest.”"
yoshiya,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1395595,"“High :)
IF NOT FOR THE SIDE EFFECTS, I'D GIVE THIS A 5 STAR :) IT'S CALM, CAN MAKE SOME SLEEPY.  I LIKE TO USE MINE AS A MIX.  IF U TRY, ENJOY :)”"
apophisnao,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1433540,"“A pleasant, pain-relieving strain with a very high CBD to THC ratio. I get the most out of this one when combined with a little of a "happy" sativa (daytime) or a sleepy indica (evening). Ironically for a pain-relieving strain, it does tend to give me a headache.”"
sunchip,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1387468,"“I got this flower in the form of a free cone when I got a new membership at a club. I had never heard of it before and was a bit wary. I finally smoked it for the first time tonight, and I can honestly say that this is the first CBD strain I have tried that has successfully taken away my migraine. Burned very well, and I didn't get a buzz like I usually get from other CBD strains (I like having a buzz, but this was s...”"
SteveSanderz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1341930,"“the one i tried was all THC and no CBD. Good taste and nice buds.”"
xtinaa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1594951,"“Best CBD strain so far! I get chronic migraines and have horrible anxiety. This takes away the migraine almost immediately and makes me relaxed. Highly recommend 🙌🏻”"
Thatgirl1985,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1624793,"“Did not like this strain. I have Fibromyalgia and have been searching for a faster action alternative for pain management then CBD oil and all the opiates and OTC meds I was on. I should preface by saying I dislike/disliked smoking Pot in general (never worked for me always flipped me out) which is why it's taken me so long to try this). This was the first strain my local shop suggested. Did not like. First, the thro...”"
random0munky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1540298,"“Pleasantly surprised how effective this strain was. High CBD with 1% THC is nice for that clear head, but still has the effectiveness to cut pain and deliver focus. Additionally, you feel happy and relaxed as you go about your day. Thanks Leafwerx”"
ladyfriend,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1574358,"“I found that this works as an excellent pain reliever for menstrual cramps, while still letting me focus on challenging tasks”"

Darkon43,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1739686,"“I tried in a preroll, found it to be a  very nice strain. Mines tested 5.5 on thc higher in cbd of course. I was having some pains with some stress  wanted to try a something  with a lesser high.  It gave me a mellow out feeling.   The pain level was decreased.”"
defo642,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1776399,"“Overall good strain. Has a good relaxed almost couch lock feeling when sitting or laying down. Can be used for daytime but I would mostly recommend for night time use. Also felt a slight bit of euphoria at the beginning. No anxious or paranoid feelings. Just relaxed ;)”"
annabeanOG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1627676,"“Suzy Q is one spicy tamale! Smells just like pepper corn and even burnt my nose a bit after the initial smell. 

Great if you’re at work and need to get rid of some pain but don’t want to appear intoxicated. 
The job I work at doesn’t care if you smoke pot but I cannot function in a work environment well at all.”"
ricem88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1376522,"“This is a good one if you're looking for a relaxed all over body experience. Made me feel a little tired and I definitely wanted to snack.”"
apophisnao,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1433545,"“A pleasant, pain-relieving strain with a high CBD:THC ratio. Slightly prone to producing headaches.”"
americanherbalspirit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1355624,"“Right off the bat, I did not have flower or concentrate of this strain directly. HOWEVER, I have tried terps derived from it, that were then added to CBD isolate. It has a beautiful vanilla almond butter smell, and leaves a creamy almond and slightly citrus/cherry aftertaste. In the form that I have, it is not going to produce a psychoactive high, but will give a slight euphoria in the forehead. It does boost energy ...”"
jordanly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1249754,"“Great tranquil head space alleviation with relaxed body high. Kind of wears you out, puts you in the zone.. but that's the point right?”"
frostyish,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1350246,"“Used the one from Irisa, Great stain for day use.
Had to go through 3 days of lectures and this strain had a great affect of calm and focus without the 'stupid' and drowsy effect of high THC strains.
Nice fruity and pineapple aroma. Used it with a vaporizer.”"
TheGoob0615,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/suzy-q/reviews/1383617,"“Bought this strain in LA a few days ago. No high, which I was expecting. It gave me a massive headache, though. I feel really shitty. Gonna try it out a few more times but damn....”"
