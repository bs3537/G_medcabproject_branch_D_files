Power Plant
=============
MuddyWaters,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/power-plant/reviews/1410870,"“Power Plant is my favorite daytime use.  I have extreme chronic pain from fibromalgia and it allows me to stay clear headed and reduced my pain significantly.  I also feel energized from both the strain and reduction in pain.  What amazed me about this strain is how clear headed it is and how clear my vision becomes.  It has been the best strain for me.  I can be in 7-9 level pain and feel an immediate and significan...”"

dojamayne,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/power-plant/reviews/1398421,"“Amnesia Haze was my favorite Sativa. No more, this Sativa is stronger than almost every kush I've smoked. Very high pain relieving qualities. Very uplifting.”"
herbpharmer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/power-plant/reviews/1412896,"“Power plant is POWERFUL! Sativa 80 / Indica 20 - Well balanced combination of body and mental effects. Physically, provides significant relief to muscle spasms and related pain. Very uplifting, calm, even meditative, without being sedating. Great for daytime medicating. Smooth creamy smoke with light flavors. Excellent all around strain.

Rated 9/10.”"
Havana,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/power-plant/reviews/1412897,"“Very clear high. I have very strong anxiety and this strain does not trigger it, helps me stay uplifted and without apathy, but is also good for insomnia.

It's difficult to find strains that leave you functional but this is definitely one. Very strong so watch the dosage.”"

The herb has a real earthy smell and is maybe a bit sweet.

Nihilox,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/power-plant/reviews/1127893,"“The first smell of this strain was a little confusing. It smelt weird. Smoked ok, wasn't particularly great for taste, especially if you accidentally burnt it when vaping. Clear cerebral high, doesn't last long. Was up and ready to drive an hour/two hours after a bowl. Would give this 3/5. It's good to smoke if you have it, but I probably would go for something else if I could.”"

A strong head high that is quite intense at first smoke, but which you quickly get used to. Gives a strong euphoric, happy, uplifting high. Highly recommended.”"

Delicious taste, more on the rubber/diesel side, but very green and relatively clean. Easy to vape.

The high comes on a little later than usual and hits you with a very smooth yet intense high on the sativa scale of things.

The mind opens up to ideas and thoughts and image. It is a beautiful world in there.”"
