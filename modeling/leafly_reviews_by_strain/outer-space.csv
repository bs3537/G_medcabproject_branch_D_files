This is a strong one and it didn't take much to send me into orbit to party with Major Tom. Seems to make everything outside a hell of lot more colorful and interesting. Certainly in my top 5... and I've plowed through quite a few strains now... 40+. Overall I would give this a 9++  Don't pass this one up if you like a good Sativa!”"

Outer Space has almost identical effects. I got off the couch, turn off the TV and actually started doing things around the house that i have been putting off for the past six months. I was tired, aggravated & in a bad mood. I had purchased a gram of Outer Space the day before from a Dispensary, so I d...”"

Happened upon some "Outer Space", promptly drove home and medicated.  When the flowers were separated and broken the scent they omitted was cyber-berry with hints of citrus in the backdrop (very nice).  In the back of my mind I thought: "It would be great to have the oil changed in the car..."  Mi...”"

Felt relaxed yet uplifted. A great daytime med yet not energized when compared to other sativas such as green crack.
I'm prone to anxiety on many strains yet this one had no such negative effect.  This is a must try!

kroniqtopus,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/outer-space/reviews/1412907,"“Another great strain by Silver Sage Wellness in Vegas. I. really like this one. For sativa lovers like me, this is a near perfect strain. It induces a happy, spacey head feel but is also great for pain relief. This is the strain I reach for when I want to be semi productive, like tinkering in my garden. Not a real focused high, I tend to die in video games while on Outer Space, but don't really care! Skunky sweet tas...”"

The high is powerful and true to its name, but I still feel engaged and comfortable around other people, no anxiety attached. It is truly an uplifting strain and while it can feel pote...”"

Until now!! This is the best sativa I have ever had extremely uplifting, and a great strain for headaches. Does not contain that drag down couch feeling , will be able to function without a problem”"
hrisgirl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/outer-space/reviews/1296292,"“Beautiful aroma that is light and airy. The sample I tasted was machine trimmed so flower was broken up into small pieces. Once lit, the aroma and taste held true to light and airy.  immediate cerebral effect but nice relaxing good for daytime use.  I have random anxiety attacks and this soothes those episodes quickly and quells them for quite a long time.  Very nice !”"

I didn't smoke it for the high so to speak.  gave me back my appetite and my spirit.  curbed my stomach pain as well.  smoked this under the stars and was at one with everything.  positive thoughts of healing.”"
Hendertucky,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/outer-space/reviews/1343255,"“Just as the name suggests you definitely space out. Nice strong head change that lasts longer than most strains, however, it is mostly felt in the body. Similar to Herijuna. Relieved the stress in my mind as well in my body. Great for those looking for a strong longer lasting stress and depression relief. Can be too strong for some. I would suggest for a novice user looking for a stronger strain. 

Strain from Silver...”"

Lynes,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/outer-space/reviews/1387598,"“This has been the most effective strain and form of cannabis use for my Tourette's, depression, and anxiety. My mind reacts very intensely when I smoke and can become very uncomfortable. This strain keeps me upbeat, gives my mind a calm, peaceful and content energy and supply's a very minor buzz without the intensity ever becoming overwhelming or uncomfortable. My personal dose size is about a grain of rice twice a d...”"
g.kirk,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/outer-space/reviews/1267055,"“Strain was recommended by my budtender and he was absolutely right, this strain is awesome. The smell is a complex sour fruity scent mixed with an island breeze. The taste out of a vape is quite nice as well. Initially the effects were distracting so I just turned some Cudi on and went with it. After one or two songs I really did feel like I was in space. It's been about 30 mins since then and I'm back in control but...”"

imhungry,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/outer-space/reviews/1215004,"“This strain is by far the best daytime high.  Opens the mind while still being able to function normally.  Really helped with headaches and neck pain.  It will also give you a bit of energy if you need a little boost.  And if you're sleepy, you can smoke a bowl before bed and sleep soundly.  Very good medicine.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/outer-space/reviews/1711671,"“Got ahold of some actual shatter instead of just the cartridge, the taste is how I wish all of my medicine could taste. It's sweet & skunky.
I was fairly medicated after 3 dabs, for me that's pretty rare.  
Would definitely buy again”"

It has a real euphoric, 2001 a Space Odyssey trip, especially if you're into a good movie or game about 15 minutes after you smoke. Calms the nerves like old Gandalf says.

The smell is something I would think outer space smells like. A very deep smell that brings you back to the jar a few more times. I would recommend this for someone feeling down or stressed.”"

I don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but it really opens up my nasal passages.  It's a similar sensation to when you sniff something peppery or spicy and sometimes it makes me sneeze.
