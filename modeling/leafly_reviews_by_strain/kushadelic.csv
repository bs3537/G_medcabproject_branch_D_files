Is it the greatest strain I've ever smoked? Definitely not, but It's name and pote...”"

Kinda took the edge off some super heavy Diesel I had smoked earlier that had hit my cerebrum like a train and given me a slightly anxious feeling.

This is a great strain if you're looking to relax, eat, or go to sleep. Great flavor and a great buzz.”"
