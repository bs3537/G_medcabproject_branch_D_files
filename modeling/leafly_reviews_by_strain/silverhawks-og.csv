Covered in beautiful red hairs, it exudes a floral, pungent aroma. One of the better smelling strains I have come across. I usually like SSH crosses, and this is one of the best ones that I have had. Hits me right away, and then builds in intensity. This is a great focused high, with moderate pain relief.”"

I had never heard of this strain, but I took one wiff of it and had to have some. The aroma is very pungent and citrusy. Very reminiscent of the super silver haze parent. The flavor was earthy and extremely citrusy. Some of the best flavor I've had. If you're into terpy flavors, this is the strain for you. Matched the aroma very well. The high was nicely...”"

LEQCANNASOINS,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silverhawks-og/reviews/1605006,"“Time for another of my Strain Reviews !  This new strain was brought to me by my Great Mohawk Friends !

 Silverhawks OG is a mix of Super Silver Haze x White Fire Alien OG and it's a 75% Sativa vs. 25% Indica.  This super Dank Cannabis is really surprising to me as it has a definite Diesel odour to the freshly ground herb, and I have steered clear of Diesels the past 18 years as I had an ex friend who crossed tonnes...”"

Super clear and uplifting, but without the potential for anxiety that occasionally creeps up on me when I'm partaking in a cerebral strain. Long lasting, clear, and mellow. Nice aroma, reminiscent of SSH”"

My only really complaint is that it made my entire body incredibly tingly- (like that pins-n-needles feeling when your arm falls asleep) -which wasn't particularly pleasant, but the energy spike made up for it!
8/10, does being energetic and feeling spikey mak...”"
