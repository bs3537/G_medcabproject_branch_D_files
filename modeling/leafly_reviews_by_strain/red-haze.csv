Red Haze
=============
TheBasicPagan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1231919,"“This is what Chester the Cheetoh Cheetah would smoke before going to his favorite jazz bar on saxophone night. You want a bud that will mellow you out yet open your mind and make things super-cool? This is for you.

For nerve pain, I give it a 9 out of 10. It's a good relaxer, so it'll probably work well with muscle pain, tension, stress, etc. I bet it works well on depression and anxiety.”"
greentreeboulder,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1363414,"“Great bud for trips up to the mountains or basically anything having to do with the outdoors. It won't let you sit down and will keep you pretty focused.”"
42ObiWanCannabinoid,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1363413,"“I rate Red Haze at a 9 out of 10. Like a previous review said, it works well on nerve pain. I also give it a 9/10 for that. I like everything about this bud. They say that you feast with your eyes first... and that's definitely true of when I first saw Red Haze. I have mixed it with so many different strains and it compliments every high that I have altered with it. If you are sitting at a cannabis dispensary, co-op,...”"
GooglyEyes,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1139785,"“The dark green colored bugs are lined with red hairs. This stain has a slightly thicker smoke than the average strain, and might leave you taking little puffs and coughing.

The High is mostly head, with body vibrations every now and then. It might leave you staggering if your not focused. This bud will not bind you to the couch.

Overall 8/10  (Excuse me for the shitty photo, It showed up better on my camera)”"
OGTom,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1324927,"“Great for students needing something later in the day in preperation for long study hours. BE WARNED SMOKING TOO MUCH MAY RESULT IN HAVING FUN.”"
TheBasicPagan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1061618,"“Never experience dizziness or headache, as some folks have said in the negatives on their reviews. My only negatives have been dry mouth and dry eyes. Munchies are controllable. No couch-lock to speak of.”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1363415,"“Definitely a heady high. Lasted a pretty long time, a little over 2 hours for me. There were a few times that I just wanted to lay down and chill, but it's very energetic and I was wandering around aimlessly most of the time. I couldn't stop giggling for like 10 minutes at one point. This is one of my favorite strains right now.”"
quinneddyrichards,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1275530,"“Yes! Totally in it for the win! This is by far the best CBD strain I've had so far. Positive, energized, focused, and good for cramps/pain without being sluggish on the body. It's enough of a high to feel different but not so high you're stoned. One of my favorited weeds.”"
jblancas90,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1261247,"“Favorite of all time”"

musicwizard,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1252271,"“This might be one of my new favorites. I'm always looking for a strain that will get me off the couch to do something, and this one was a great motivator. Once I'm out and about, this also helped with my overall mood and social anxiety, making it the perfect outside-daytime strain. It hurt my throat a bit, and sometimes a got a bit dizzy for a second... But other than that, it's perfect. It makes everything sparkle a...”"
Koraytuwgga,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1580635,"“Strongly head high and barely any body high. Great for social events or getting creative.”"
GreenMan77,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1221469,"“This strain was pretty good. It kept me focused and i felt good but i felt a little paranoid (wasnt fun for my anxiety) but nothing too extreme. It burned rather nicely and had somewhat of a spicy scent.”"
GooglyEyes,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1061623,"“The flavour: Very dry, but it has an aftertaste that is pretty cool.
The Smoke: It was a little bit thicker than the average stuff, More for intermediate stoners.

Overall 8/10 I'm writing a review while high on this shit”"
stennett84,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1240410,"“Top notch very good Stran. Very hard to fine. The reason is the high is so awesome. Makes you want to solve world hunger. And do algebra and trigonometry at the same time.”"
kagalop1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1258040,"“Red Haze is absolutely amazing. I smoked it on my balcony and after the 2nd joint the trees'  shadows outside began to morph and form shapes and silhouettes of people. I have never had a psychedelic experience from cannabis before, but this seems to do it. All in all an amazing strain.”"

squanchmaster,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1251219,"“I picked this up from Bloom for its low THC and high CBD. It was pleasant and not too high-inducing, but there were so many seeds and I haven't found seeds in any dispensary product before, so I was a little miffed about that.”"
419blazefaze,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1207980,"“So far one of my favorite strains. I could feel my veins stretching and everything inside me was being pulled. My mind was racing to everything there was. I heard loud fire drill sirens that made music it was wonderful. This is a good strain to smoke with a friend. Move around, skate. anything but sit down. Good strain for concerts. Great euphoria. Great for pain. Makes me wanna hug everything. Super dry mouth. Good ...”"
weed boy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1564611,"“To start, I gave Red Haze a 5 star as it was my favorite smoke up to so far. The bud looked and smelt beautiful and came with a incredible smoke. Smooth and hitting me fast, I was very happy.”"
EwanIndikey,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1745810,"“I smoked a lot of this strain during my young adult age and it was always mind-blowing. At the first puff you are directly committed in an energetic uplifting feeling will lasts for hours. The effect brings you a very motivational sensation by a spicy woody taste. When you have smoked a whole joint you can become slightly paranoid but it's never a problem. Due to its american heritage this is a strain for people want...”"
BreezeThreez18,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1288836,"“This strain is a great combination of alertness and relaxation that I have found in a while, works wonders for daytime pain relief. Also find the cerebral effects to be enchanting, feeling stress roll off my shoulders.”"
AdamZapel,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1224151,"“I have only tried this strain in the form of a brownie from a dispensary. It was all focused in my head. It really messed up my eyes.”"
drpmuzik,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1437776,"“Instant effects, potency is KNOCKOUT! Beautiful hazy flavors, ranging from earthy to sweet and fruity. For this to be 100% sativa, I'm very pleased with the results. Laid back, typing a little off-key every now and then as the high builds, but I'm euphoric, relaxed and ready for some snacks lol!”"
Pistol097,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1149168,"“This strain of marijuana is one of the longest lasting medicinal effects. Don't let the lack of "sugar" fool you! The ridiculous amount of red hairs make up for it! I'd recommend this strain to people with high stress lives and people that have severe anxiety and depression.”"
smokingfresh21,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1197831,"“If u guys do parkour this is perfect for u me and my girlfriend were tripping for hours so yeah I recommend this weed”"
j3swag,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/red-haze/reviews/1248796,"“Fantastic strain, nice strong but not ridiculous, made me feel focused but still relaxed. 

2 hours later and i still feel euphoric. Def a fav.”"
