Plebius1312,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1732118,"“Beautify covered in trichomes, purps and crystals, this glistening nug will surely sedate you without however clouding your mind. The numbing effects of this strain make it really efficient against pain and the anxiety reducing clearheadedness of this smoke surely makes it a strain to try out if given the opportunity.”"
Stunnned,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1747461,"“The rating (3.5) on Leafly is not, currently, an accurate representation of this strain.  I knew from some research that this strain has a reputation of being a heavy hitter, so I thought I was prepared for that kind of hit.  Boy was I wrong.  WOW!  
I love indicas, as I primarily smoke at the end of the day to unwind.  This not only unwound me, it disassembled me.  I didn't move for over an hour.  I just sat in this...”"
scottypolyoculi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1751220,"“I have higher have higher THC indicas in my collection, but none that close the blinds and end the day as fast as this one. I can't give it more than 4 stars because I can't stay awake long enough to judge any of it's other merits. Sunset is aptly named; save this for when you absolutely need to put down every MFer in the room.”"

ravehan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1760297,"“Extremely sedating. This strain should have a much higher review, the trichome coverage is amazing and the perfect way to end a night.”"
SpaceGhost28,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1796843,"“Even though I bought this strain as a hybrid, it feels like it's very indica heavy. It's listed as an 87.5% THC and 7.0% other cannabinoids. A great pain reliever and also nice for stress removal. I will be giving it a try for help with insomnia. I'm glad to see it in my area.”"
TorontoZDL,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1795240,"“Was only available in 3.5 gram size. Ordered two containers. Not one solid bud. Truly disappointing.”"

JoruBludorn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1785440,"“This strain is great if you have anxiety and have problems relaxing. It's a fairly potent indica, and not as expensive as some of the other strong indicas in Canada. I have paid up to $25/gram for strains, such as Hindu and Gorilla Glue, in the post legalization dispenseries. My only complaint is the possibility of getting ammonia flavour instead of wood, it leaves quite an aftertaste.”"
growlasaurus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1759051,"“I really like this one. I've tried only as a microdose in capsule format. It snuck up, I got some stuff done, and now I'm ready for bed. Basically all I could ask for in a bedtime strain!”"
JoeRedRog,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1760146,"“Great spicy piney taste on the exhale.  Super strong.  Best smoke. Ive gotten from the OCS yet.  Pricey but worth the extra 5 bucks a quad.  No seeds no sticks no stems!”"
tooshtamper,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1766084,"“Not a big fan, starts with an almost chemical taste to it. The effects are decent, but the taste is a big downer”"
Entistic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1784404,"“Whoof!  Thank Leafly for mentioning ammonia as part of this strain's flavour profile or I'd think there was something seriously wrong with this bud!  This strain is strong in aroma and taste.  The smell of the nugs is strongly pine, ammonia, and clove.  Grinding tones it down to a more pleasant woodsy/black pepper/clove.  When I vape it, I get a really powerful taste of Pine-Sol and Windex, then black pepper and clov...”"

The trichome levels are incredibly impressive and”"
realitybytes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sunset/reviews/1771558,"“I have been wondering how one week I get a container of this strain with 23% THC on the label and then another week the label says 15% How can you get such a wild swing in thc content for a single strain grown by a single manufacturer. Something not right with THC content on packages.”"
