The smoke I inhaled was smooth, but in a few moments my body was blasted away into pure indica relaxation.  I absolutely love this strain - the taste, effects, length of effects are all perfect for me.”"
Dankeffect420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/berry-noir/reviews/1332467,"“The first thing you notice is the color. It has beautiful reddish hairs all through and a smell of perfume/ammonia. Pungent taste at first but it calms the more you smoke. Nice calming buzz that left me with a feeling of a mask on my eyes. If you smoke too much your mind can get busy.”"

MedPatient-GB,https://www.leafly.com/indica/berry-noir/reviews/1258844,"“Berry Noir .. the name holds true! Beautiful parentage! pure berries on the palate after breathing out.  Not super clear, but very nice looking regardless.  I have been slowly dabbing this over the course of 3  days now and every glob tastes the same, no butane taste and very little heaviness in the chest even at slightly higher heat.  

 Will be getting more from the producers! Diamond Concentrates! Try em if you se...”"
