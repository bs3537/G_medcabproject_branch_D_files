Right when you open the jar a pugent strawberry soda pop smell smacks you in the face, and the mello, euphoric high will keep you happy and pain free all day long. I'm extremely honored to have met Savant and get pretty much the last of this strain. For what I heard from him personally, he will not be growing the Faygo Re...”"

Our power had been out since 6am due to an ice storm so around maybe 3 or so, my wife and I decided to smoke this and play a board game while our pets snuggled around us for warmth. I don’t think we’ve had that much fun while in frozen agony in ages!

I couldn't stop smiling from ear to ear with the emotions that you experience as a young child when you have fresh made cookies from your favorite grandma (because we all know group up you like one WAYYY more than the other).  However all that being said you will have cotton mouth like no other. I mean like eat 6 saltine crackers and then try to ...”"

What better way to celebrate the holiday with a strain that has local roots, local controversy and celebrates a legend. I loved Faygo red pop growing up so as soon as the strain popped up on a local dispensaries menu, I had to try. I wish there was a grape version to this. I don't know if it was my brain making it up but the ta...”"
