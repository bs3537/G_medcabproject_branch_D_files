JloSmokey,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/supernatural/reviews/1161315,"“Potent for Sativa, can make you tired if not productive. Smell is very zesty cheezy like. But excellent smoke!”"
jerrycruncher,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/supernatural/reviews/1369511,"“Beautiful, purple-tinged bud that even after adequate grinding requires a bit more time in the vape chamber than others to get up to temperature.

Emerald Jane's June 2015 batch is quite potent, and I find the high to be fairly murky and opaque. Not unpleasantly so, but I wouldn't want to hit this if I had any plans afterwards.”"

IndicaKid,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/supernatural/reviews/1388205,"“Green Crack level sativa. Massively strong sativa head punch to even the most experienced smokers, some of the frostiest, most trichome rich bud I've ever seen. Smokes surprisingly smooth and gives you a long euphoric high that is so strong that you may find it hard to gather your thoughts and speak them to others. It feels like a massage on your brain.”"
