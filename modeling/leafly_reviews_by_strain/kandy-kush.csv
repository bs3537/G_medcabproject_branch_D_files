Super gelling vibe that's ridiculously chill and lets you just ENJOY LIFE! There's lots of love and genuine compassion towards everything...super rasta, man. Very cheery and actively engaged. Amazingly happy and genuine...heartfelt. Mentally present and capable, but you can get lost in stuff. Strangely ju...”"

I feel creative, which is extremely strange, and comfortable in public versus being paranoid. I'm 1/2 way thru a medium blunt now and am thinking of things to do... I'm ready to share this with my bf and see what his opinion is. 💚💚”"
LeroyBrown420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kandy-kush/reviews/1418711,"“I thought it would be Kooler. Not a bad strain. How couldn't she be with Trainwreck and OG Kush genetics? Known for her commercial growing capabilities and large yield. This pheno was not the tastiest nor the sexiest but medicated me just fine. A little harsh to be perfectly honest. The buzz is great, perfectly balanced hybrid with a stony feel.”"
CaliChris,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kandy-kush/reviews/1390192,"“Just tried Kandy Kush right now. It's rightfully named because it tastes and smells slightly sweet. The smoke was pretty smooth and the high is fast acting. Very nice comfortable buzzing body high. I feel very euphoric, uplifted, and oddly enough, both slightly focused and sedated at the same time. This is a pretty unique high, but I am really enjoying it. I'm losing track of time quite easy right now. It makes your ...”"

Jeunepuffer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kandy-kush/reviews/1417787,"“Kandy Kush will surprised you with it sweet pleasant smell. It is a potent stain. Indica dominant, this one is definitely a couch locker. It reliefs your body and your mind at the same time. Makes you wander in your thoughts and stare at the windows or walls for a long time! Kandy Kush made me kinda tired though (indica dominant) definitely a must cop, you won't regret it :)”"

About two hours before bedtime I packed a bowl of Kandy Kush. It sent me into one of the most relaxed and soothing evenings I've had in a long while. When I was done watching a trippy episode of Cosmos (Could have been C-Span but how would I know?) I was treated to a night of relaxing sleep. I am indeed a fan of Kandy Kush.”"

From joint to bowls to blunts this strain gets ya. i love, love good tasting weed. This weed tastes exactly as it smells. First 20 minutes the train gets to your head and you're worthless and then it settles in a mellow, calming Kush high. Smoked enough of it to know that i'm handicapped for 30 minutes after the first big rip lol.”"
