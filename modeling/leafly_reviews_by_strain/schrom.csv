Schrom
=============
piccadilley,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1394569,"“Since finding Schrom, I can now officially report that I have a favorite strain. I have been reviewing strains on Leafly for nearly a year now, and have tried oodles from dispensaries in the Seattle area. None have stuck out in my memory so well as Schrom.

I first tried this strain 1-2 months ago, and got the batch from Have a Heart Cafe by way of Kevin's Gardens. I came in looking for a sativa and the smell of Schr...”"

I don't expect a Sativa to "blow your hair back" like a kush.  Schrom put that to rest and slapped me upside the head.  

Beautiful manicure, now here's the kicker.  If you have smelled what was known as Tangerine Haze in the Long Beach / So. Cal circuit then you know what this is.  

Buds are very uniform, no popcorn.  Grind is easy, with medium kief in the catcher.  

S...”"

The high was uplifting, a little silly, along with a big creative burst and not too much drowsiness.  Definitely a cerebral high, but was pleased to note some muscle-relaxing benefits.  Great for gaining perspective on a challenging project and enjoying yourself.  Definitely not for working o...”"

I can say this for certain, since I first acquired the strain from shroomy420, in about 2001 or so. Schrom is short for "Schroomy's Colombian x Romulan. According to him, the father was Colombian Gold. But he said that he did not make the original cross, he just pimped it out a bit and stabilized it. I am glad to see that this girl is still around, and that people still giv...”"

baileyr845,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1368722,"“Let it be known throughout the kingdom that I shall name my firstborn son after this strain. Schrom is the love of my life. Perfect in every situation, any time of the day. Smells like 7-Up. Woah........I am real hungry.”"
Socalvenom,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1370626,"“I bought three grams online and had it delivered, once I received Schrom I opened up the vacuumed sealed bag and the first thing I smelled was a lemon, citrusy aroma I medicated with my ice bong and it was delicious, sweat but not over powering you can tell this was fine herb. My lower back pain was instantly gone within a minute and my head was cleared, I was suffering from a migraine at the time but that was also a...”"

Binyahbinyah,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1375076,"“This is the best strain I've ever come across, it's uplifting, inspiring, and tranquil.”"
mickfromkent,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1334379,"“These are additional comments on Schrom that I've had twice in the past 8 days

I like Schrom.  Not sleepy, quite talkative.  Not too spacey.  Like problem solving with articulation.  This strain is pretty hard to find in Seattle area.

No big appetite, no paranoia, no anxiety.

Kind of reminds me of getting 'stoned' on Mexican weed many years ago.

Quite nice”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1370632,"“I've learned that the strains said to be "euphoric" are actually just foggy headed. Schrom made my head feel a bit scrambled and that's not an effect I personally enjoy. On the plus side, it struck a good balance between energetic and relaxing.”"
adam71,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1770351,"“Schrom is hands down in my top 3 favorite daytime medicate during the day and occasionally I'll even revisit it a little later the same night! Incredible pain relief for IBD and one of the best sativas I've ever had.”"
jstarr1002,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1370629,"“This strain is pretty nice. Very good for working or focusing on something- a lift for the day.. Motivation to get up and move.
 A great strain for waking and baking... But I have noticed my sleeping hasn't been as good as it is on most MJ! So... 

There's nothing that makes me want to buy it again- but I get what I can! Enjoyed each high thoroughly.”"
JagweedMcBane,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1370627,"“Love this. It's good for a prototypical pot high. Relaxing but not paralytically so.”"
mickfromkent,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1370631,"“Had it a few times in the  past couple  weeks.  It's  a thoughtful  kind of high. Can make  you  very  talkative.  Not sleepy.  Pretty nice but no euphoria.  Didn't  make me hungry.  Half dozen hits and lasted  about  4-5 hours.
No real  trippiness.”"
seegracestoned,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1370630,"“This is a head high of head highs! It induces a really good euphoric feeling that pulled me out of cycle of negative energy. It made me feel very happy and relaxed and hungry.

After the high passed, I had a hard time sleeping, so I wouldn't recommend this for pre-sleep toking.”"
cascadianpatriot,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1370628,"“Good focused Sativa. Not necessarily the best for social situations. But you can get shit some. Wonderful flavor; dank citrus. Allows laser-like focus.”"

SeattleQua,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1759660,"“I haven’t tried it yet but I’m pretty sure it’s Colombia gold rather then Silver Haze.”"
theORherb,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1641151,"“A great sativa! I got it at Tsunami off W26 & the flower was grown in Astoria, OR. Yay for local bud! It smells awesom...lots of lemon. It drlivers a nice clear cerebral-buzz! I'm enjoying it for the first time out in the sun!”"
RadGrrl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1721059,"“This strain just replaced Blue Dream at #1 in my top 5 All Time Fav.

I don't even really need to write a review really. Anyone who came of age in the late 70s - early 80s will totally FEEL the Columbian Gold genetics ❤❤❤”"
Debaser,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/schrom/reviews/1151527,"“A very pleasant surprise. Was the lowest-priced item on the rec store menu, so lots of value. Focused high with stamina - buy it.”"
