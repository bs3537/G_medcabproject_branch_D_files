Jock Horror

twystedsyster,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jock-horror/reviews/1385610,"“Jock Horror is a twist on the family of strains that arose around the Jack Herer name. The mother is a Haze 19 x Skunk, a hazey hybrid cross of Holland and California strains. Jock's father is an old-school Northern Lights, a mostly indica plant taken from a 20-year stable Afghan x Skunk #1 cross whose line was preserved in the marijuana mecca of America's Pacific northwest.

Jock Horror is its own original strain ...”"

kitoheigori,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jock-horror/reviews/1385611,"“I love this strain. It's I'd say my absolute favorite strain. It makes any kind of bad day significantly better. I can handle stress and manage my depression when I smoke this. This is just me so don't take this as any kind of advise on any mental disorder managing but this, to me, works better than any of my antidepressants ever did.”"

Aside from a world class case of the munchies, which is a deal breaker for me, I loved growing and smoking this strain. 
I grew mine outdoors, receiving only about 5.5 hours direct light per day at the 43rd parallel. The result was a stocky plant of about 4.5 feet in height. The buds were not disappointing whatsoever, even with less then ideal light. Full and heav...”"

The unique and best thing about these types of strains are their combination with northern lights which brings you a nice sativa experience without too much negative. If you enjoy indica and want to try a sativa without it being too strong of a sativa this will do. 

The munchies are uncontrollable at least for me on this one, and its the reason I probably wont use it again. Since I am...”"
BlessTheRain,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jock-horror/reviews/1796637,"“Grown by a friend in a legal state, I didn’t know it’s reputation as being an “uplifting Sativa.” 

I slipped over into my paranoid, overly self-conscious, existential crisis mode which is what I’m trying to avoid at baseline and this made it x100. 

I was fidgety, felt head pressure, and even a little angry. I did have energy and sex on it was good- maybe because it distracted me. 

Do not want to try again. Too rev...”"
