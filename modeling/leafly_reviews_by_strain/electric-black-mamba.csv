A couple off times when i smoked i did get tingly all over. The packed buds were medium green with dark orange pistils. Buds had fuzzy peach hairs with clear trichomes. Skunky fruit berry was the taste & smell i got. Make sure you get bitten by this strain if you are lucky enough to come across it!”"

I don't feel too heavy on it though which is especially nice given the amount of relief it provides.

I will definitely be getting some more the next time it is available.”"
