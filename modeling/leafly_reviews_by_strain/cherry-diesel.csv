A friend had bought some and we smoked it out of a pipe,I remember it tasting so delicious, and sweet. The bud was super sticky as well.  It got me so high that I accidentally pushed the panic button on my car keys and couldnt figure out how to turn it off again for like 5 minutes...and this was at like 2am. HA.

Faithor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-diesel/reviews/1310153,"“Great daytime strain. Able to be productive and relaxed. Really good if you want to destress without sedation. Right now I'm chillin in a lawn chair out in the sun gettin my natural Vitamin D production goin, then gonna play some competitive Rocket League. This strain is good for that kinda stuff. As for the social side, I'm not with anyone right now but I could easily keep up in a conversation.”"

Usually the cherry taste dominates, but once in a while the fuel taste is a little much, but otherwise it's hard to find any negatives with this strain. Great energy and happiness comes with creative thoughts. Reminds me of strawberry cough.”"
