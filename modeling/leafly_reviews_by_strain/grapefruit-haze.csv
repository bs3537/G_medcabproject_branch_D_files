Eyesinmysmoke,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit-haze/reviews/1353929,"“Nice strong smell, many orange hairs and a decent lasting high. Not too much sleepiness or hunger inducement, so it's great for a wake and bake session.”"
PotsterBoy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit-haze/reviews/1411404,"“I have issues with depression and this is the medicine for me.
I have only had it in vape oil pen.
I normally can't smoke sativas but in pen vape format, I am not getting any sativa bad side-effects (I've noticed this for other sativas and hybrids when smoking pen vapes).
This is my go-to in the mornings and when I'm in a dark place.
It makes me positive and able to get up and do things.
When you are feeling down, pu...”"

Ended up laughing so hard that I almost got a cramp in my stomach. After about an hour I had some serious munchies though!”"
BlewJ,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit-haze/reviews/1344199,"“Just the high I like. Very good, happy strain. Helps me overcome crippling social anxiety, so that I can leave my room (and even house), and to interact with other human beings, to make it a positive experience for all. It's so nice to have found this strain in particular, to help feel better in the face of evil, more confident, more joyful that it is miserable. As you can tell, this strain also makes one tend to lik...”"

I have loved Haze ever since i 1st found a spot that had 30s of a SS Haze pheno called catpiss, I was 16 11yrs ago and still love it today. The batch i got had 3z of indica dominant and 1z of a sativa dom pheno. Honestly there was little differnce besides bud structure,the highs were identical despite what you would think. The smell is a peppery grapefruit aroma ,a perfect blend of flavor...”"

JohnnyNomad,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit-haze/reviews/1131128,"“Not sure why but up here in Vancouver when I bought this for the fifth or sixth time it was completely changed from the taste to the effects. It now tastes like pepper and looks really premature and smells nothing like it use to. I blame myself for not looking at it first. Even the effects were gone it use to make me very talkative and active and it did nothing but burn me out.
I got it from the Cannaclinic Medicinal...”"

BernieMadoff0001,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/grapefruit-haze/reviews/1350612,"“One of my favorite strains.
Positives: It is a high THC level, and tends to be cheaper than the rest.  Lasts a long time.
Negatives: Joint does not burn smoothly and it goes out multiple times.  It is also a bit harsh on the throat to smoke. All that aside, this is strong and lasts a long time. 25 years of experience, and I would rank this side by side any other strain.”"

It has a rich flavor, lemony fruity and is almost sour. Smells as good. Loved it! If weed could be a funny comedienne, this strain would take top prize. I found many things humorous and was quite funny. Felt happy and playful and didn't want to wash the smell off my hands...ever! :)

The name is true to its taste, a tangy inhale, and nothing but a sweet bliss of Grapefruit on exhale. The taste of fresh Grapefruit lingers in your mouth even after the high wears off.... The high is good too, definitely not the best but there is no sleepy come down what's so ever”"
