Frosty
=============
Dinosaurworld,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1341917,"“Very heady high.  I agree with one of the other reviews; this doesn't hit your body at all.  I got pretty chatty, relaxed and focused.  A good reading strain.  Also, I didn't get much of a dry mouth.”"
LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1248710,"“Talk about some very very frosty buds, it could easily be mad in hash because of all the white trichomes, it's a very hardcore strain. Best for insomnia & anxiety!”"
magickmama,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1201986,"“Love it...excellent taste smell and it us very very frosty”"
crazycolton55,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1344702,"“This weed is a dark green color, and is very leafy, however, when broken up it is gluelike sticky with a wet in appearance crystals. This weed smells toooo skunky pungent and when smoked will launch you into a mellow head high great for studying or something in the winter. Enjoy! 4/5!”"
Cannamudthc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1695274,"“A lot of flavor to this strain I love the dense cookie smoke and heavy buds. It’s a head high but a good one we’re you can still function lol.”"
M.J.Green,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1064150,"“Very good Indica. Effective for before bed or meals, provides that very solid Indica trance.  The crop I got certainly resembled a coffee-like taste like that one other user described. Also a definite  candidate for pain disassociation/(suppression).”"
MzBabie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1590387,"“frosty kept my brain thinking a million thoughts at once. I felt slight panic and increased anxiety but it did come down after a little while. I then felt relaxed and calm”"
ClydeFr0g87,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1635142,"“This strain, this...Frosty...is a dynamic strain. 

The smooth and extremely relaxing high was surprisingly euphoric. Very good for relaxing I hear. 

There’s just the softest kiss of a body high, but that’s real good for tense muscles I hear.”"
Bowtechman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1383374,"“I had a different experience compared to other reviewers. I was couchlocked for about 3 hours. I probably could have moved after two hours but i was sooo relaxed, I didn't even want to get up to satisfy the munchies which weren't too bad. 
Relaxed, happy, laughing at a stupid tv program.  It was a happy or content, high. 
Perfect "alone time" high.”"
NolaMMJ1993,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1338305,"“I picked up a gram of Frosty at my local dispensary. It was one of their super premium strains, the most expensive you can buy. The nugs are nice and dense and covered in trichomes with an earthy aroma. Definitely an indica-dominant strain just from the appearance. So far so good. The high at first was super mellow and had me wondering: "Is this it? Did I really pay $20 for this?" But then it hits you. About an hour ...”"

masterchiefsensai,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1690576,"“Glad I came across this strand. Some high quality stuff. And apparently you get just a head high. Burns smooth as hell. Definitely not some everyday stuff and has a distinct smoking experience in general. I wish I never ran out.”"

DJS1707,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1495033,"“This is a really nice smoke. Very relaxing, very smooth and Bold but sweet taste, the aroma is also very bold. Definitely a bed time strain, as it made me pretty sleepy...”"
Sparklestone,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1158194,"“Nice feel but quite cerebral and I needed more of a body buzz for shoulder pain. It helped but I like to stay in my head more.”"

camtgrant,https://www.leafly.com/indica/frosty/reviews/1139852,"“This strain is unique in smell and taste. It has a more earthy and sage taste. This indica dominant strain smokes well and has a medicated, calming effect. Not overwhelming, more mild effects.”"
