I grind then vaporize.

This strain made me tired and seems best for insomnia.”"

This is definitely a good  strain in my book. I like the indica effects to it and the cerebral sati a side was just the right amount. I had no problems with this strain. I would use this during the day or evening, depending if you want to chill or eat then sleep.”"

frankie18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-velvet/reviews/1348449,"“Maui Waui is one of my favorite strains ever.

Fat, greasy, tropical-dank smelling, nugs from heaven that break down nicely are the typical.

The high...unparalleled for my money's worth. Just the tip of the iceberg: I sat on a bus, and saw the world passing through the windows like a slideshow-amusement park type thing (or a rocketship) after a few seconds of a milky hit.”"
