I am a heavy medical user, which can be frustrating because my tolerance is high. It can be difficult to find strains that are strong enough to give me a notable, undeniably medicinal effect. 

This is a couch-lock high, and the CBCB describes this as "Sedative. Good for sleep" on its website, while a...”"

EST19XX.LACEUP,https://www.leafly.com/indica/legend-og/reviews/1423322,"“Love it. I have an Autoimmune Disease called Rheumatoid Arthritis, anxiety+panic attacks, insomnia and migraines. Although it doesn't help with the migraines, but it does ease the Chronic pain a lil bit. It gives my body a numb feeling, helps my anxiety and helps me sleep. Overall, I like how it makes me relaxxed.”"

Steeleyoface,https://www.leafly.com/indica/legend-og/reviews/1793594,"“I like smoking powerful indica strains in the morning sometimes. Just to see how it will make me feel. After two hits. I thought the reviews i read were BS. Omg this stuff creeps up and bam! Im laughing my eyes are weird feeling. I have had coffee and a bowl. Legend is an amazingly strong buzz. Taste very good and sticky to the touch. Probably need to use this one later in the day. But have fun with it on a wake-n-ba...”"
CaptainQuazar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/legend-og/reviews/1776635,"“My gram of Legend OG from Ilera was 1 big Christmas tree shaped bud, complete with snowy frosting. Seemed a shame to grind it, but I did and it gave a vanilla scent. Tasted like diesel fuel however. I was having a bad pain day and this helped. Also gave a mellow, relaxing, and oddly uplifting head buzz. Paired to perfection with Letterkenny. This is some good shit, but I wouldn't call it Legend-Derry.”"
G_indica_lover,https://www.leafly.com/indica/legend-og/reviews/1782762,"“Top notch indica, it was something i picked up just to try and now its one of my favorite strains. It really worked wonders for my anxiety and insomnia. When i first opened the jar i wasn't very impressed with the looks but when i tried it wow it was just awesome. 5 Stars all day long........”"
