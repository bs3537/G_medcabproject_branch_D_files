It's makes me smile and giggle and want to eat. I get it from arrow alternative care in CT. It smells like heaven! A heavy fruity smell. Cherry would be spot on! I have people smell it and try to guess the fruit. 

I'm looking for some requirements in my medicine. It has to calm me down. It has to help with pai...”"

BaconBurger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-thunder-fuck/reviews/1374434,"“Wow...

Had three pulls on this from my water bong and it turned this seasoned vet into a noob fast.
I can get prone to anxiety when smoking some sativa heavy strains but thought I mostly learned to handle the controls. Boy was I wrong.
Simultaneously sunk into the couch and experienced a big head buzz. Hax a great time but made me mildly paranoid and awake during bedtime.
Treat this one with respect.”"
Alrightdude710,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-thunder-fuck/reviews/1507328,"“You can tell Curaleaf puts a lot of care into this strain. The buds are perfect, hardly any stem. There are no little seeds or seed casings- just frosty, visibly SPARKLING nugget. This is the kind of bud where it looks like there's glitter on your buds because of how well developed the trichomes are!

The smell is an adventure, it's incredibly pungent and fruity cherry at the same time. As soon as I opened the bottle...”"
rooscruise,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-thunder-fuck/reviews/1416465,"“Sweet cherry fuck... Very uplifting euphoric funny happy high. Could not stop laughing. Very strong, don't need much for immediate effect. Not a paranoid high at all. One of favorite strains so far. Smells like citrus basil amazing. Head high, not a body high. But a very calming head high. Could not personally do before needing to function during the day... Definitely has a couch lock after. For an Indica lover, this...”"
Sarcastic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-thunder-fuck/reviews/1363584,"“A beautiful strain to the eye.  Leaves tended to be on the darker side.  Wonderful earthy smell with overtones of pine and cherry.  Bold, citrus taste.  
     As for the high, I'd say it's both calming and euphoric.  One could argue that it has the ability to sedate.  
     Overall, I'd definitely recommend to a friend.”"
iread2xs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-thunder-fuck/reviews/1363587,"“Its easy to see why this strain sells out as soon as it comes into the dispensary. After smoking just a few bowls I was not feeling any of my joint pains (ha ha ha) and my creative mind high gave me plenty of ideas of what I should get up and do(tomorrow), Just when I thought I was coming down from my high, it would build back up, so it was a cyclical high that lasted about 3-4 hours after smoking only a small amount...”"

Very strong, don't need to do much to feel amazing. Not a paranoid high. Smells like citrus berry amazing. And basil. Head high, not a body high, but a calming head high. Could not do before needing to function during the day… Definitely has a couch lock afterwards”"
pf47069,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-thunder-fuck/reviews/1414632,"“This strain is one of the best for getting that stereotypical stoner high, it only takes 10-15 min for the full body effects kick in while the cerebral rush is there immediately.

smokes relatively smooth; vaporize's better

didn't notice the cherry taste that much.”"
BlazinBenny,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-thunder-fuck/reviews/1534070,"“enjoying Curaleaf's Cherry TF and it is by far my fav medicinal strain. beautful buds, covered in sugar.  great daytime strain with enough punch for nighttime use as well”"

CatgirlSakura,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-thunder-fuck/reviews/1586257,"“*disclaimer: we are noobs*
My wife used this to nake brownies with. We ground the bud up into a fine powder and heated it in the oil (low heat, 30min) before adding to the brownie mix. Results were a very intense high, with couch lock. as with any edible, it took an hour or two to kick in. very strong and long lasting. dont underestimate this strain.”"

Definitely a cerebral and a creative strain. I’ve never been disappointed with Cherry Thunder F, it’s always a pleasure, it’s fun, functional. and did I mention delicious? The sweet ripe cherry flavor is not subtle.  I can’t see anyone not enjoying this strain”"

This strain has an amazing cherry taste, and it smokes very nicely in my bowl. Its powerful. So you jave to be careful because it will knock you on your ass if you smoke too much. It is a great strain to just pack a decent hit in your pipe or bong and take it one at a time. One good hit from thos strain and your pretty much where you want to be....”"

The REv abandoned the strain and the last of the seeds were handed off to 4 Dragons the head breeder for Seeds of Compassion. 4 Dragons created Cherry Cake and Wild Cherry plus made more of the Cherry Thunderfu...”"
