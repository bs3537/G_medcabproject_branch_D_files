Yeti OG

rkowna,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yeti-og/reviews/1391641,"“This is an amazing pain strain. From the first hit through the muscle melting onset this strain is amazing. The smoke, or in my case the vapor, is very dense, almost foggy. The sensation is similar to ice cream, a very smooth, yet dense, tasty inhale. 

At first I was worried about the heaviness the strain would bring. I dont have time for couch lock, and the initial creamy smoke plus the diesel flavor is reminiscent...”"
SheriffJohnBrown,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yeti-og/reviews/1381853,"“Seeing only 22 reviews on Leafly, I was curious to stray this strain out. I bought an eighth. The quality itself wasn't out of this world- it was more on the average side. However, as soon as I smoked this Yeti OG I fell into a world of euphoria, where music was entering my soul. I believe it's the high CBD content. Also, because of the CBD, I couldn't get paranoid- I could smoke a ton and be super relaxed. Creamy, c...”"

skyballs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yeti-og/reviews/1414159,"“On first glance is looks familiar like headband.  Smells of funky cheese and brand new can of tennis balls.  Breaks open to reveal OG characteristics of pine aroma and earth.  Vape is a wonderful combination of rose flowers, pine and lemon.  I consider this one to have heavy narcotic qualities:  drowsy and medicated:  ~3% CBD!  A new favorite.”"
that70sgranny,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yeti-og/reviews/1377969,"“I purchased this a few months ago but only a gram. I'm sorry I didn't get more! Perfect for a nice relaxing evening. It also takes care of my neuropathy pain very well. It is very potent so go easy! I feel like I'm going under for surgery after a few hits and I sleep wonderfully. I will most definitely be looking for this on the next visit to a dispensary.”"
zachl32,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yeti-og/reviews/1382057,"“Copped a G of live resin of this Yeti OG from Elevated Extracts about a week ago. Good medicine is very hard to come by where I live and finding live resin of this quality is even more rare. I smoke mostly flower so take from this what you will. In regards to my tolerance. 

I have major depression, ptsd and really bad anxiety attacks. Just really had a chance to sit down and take a decent size dab of this Yeti OG af...”"

gloryhaze,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yeti-og/reviews/1363356,"“Love the Yeti for a nice relaxing evening. Hits hard and fast. Be prepared to be in bed shortly. 
I can say since trying this blend, my sleep has been much deeper and dreams more vivid. Really just zonks you out. Aches and pains right out the door. 

Beautiful flower, with a strange taste. But not unpleasant. Big, fluffy/dense (just the perfect mix) buds from this plant.”"
White_Jesus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/yeti-og/reviews/1384221,"“This strain. Bigfoot definitely decided to make it nice on the body and mind. Excellent couch-lock effects. No anxiety, just a feeling that you put something great into your body. Got this from dawgstar in a solventless vape pen. Very bad for late night IT work. Do not use this strain when on call. Good for sleep but make sure you have no obligations. Five stars.”"

While it only tested at 16.60% THC, it got a whopping .87% CBD, which is high for regular flower.  It's labeled a 70/30 indica and I would agree with this.  Love the body high from the CBD and I do feel relaxed.   Plus it smells and tastes like ripe skunky orange mint.  I think of an exotic coc...”"

I have an awful migraine right now and it's not doing much for me. Not much for normal aches and pains either. I'm glad this strain is popular but I'm not THAT impressed. Would rather smoke the Cherry OG or Wedding Cake instead. Paranoia level: 0/10.”"
