BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1581951,"“Even though there's only about 20 reviews for this strain it's a solid 4.5/5. It's Triangle Kush & Georgia Pine. Versatile can be used as a day time chill smoke or at night a more sedating smoke 
Strains like this make me thankful for being in a medical state, I have severe scoliosis and one side of my lower back is constantly burning or cramping from the one side of the muscle holding up both sides.. This strain mak...”"
GMDuke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1516879,"“Known as Sativarin T grown by Advanced Grow Labs here in CT, I picked this strain for it's high CBG-A level as medication for my glaucoma. Having never sampled this strain or it's parents, Triangle Kush, & Georgia Pine, my interest was piqued. To start, what absolutely beautiful flowers, light green with golden amber pistils. Upon first sniff you get a light pine scent, very clean, like nothing I've experienced befor...”"
couchlock79,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1385259,"“new great strain for depression and pain. sticky sweet and lime green. Glad this was on special today as I may have never tried due to the name.It has the best of both worlds, seemingly indica Dominant but the high is energizing, relaxed, and  creative feeling great head high and body buzz. When you come down your not all tired either.”"
beeLove80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1298217,"“A great hybrid! Got a gram and smoked a bowl, saw no reviews on here so thought I'd weigh in. My bowl is gunky so I won't weigh in on taste. great smell, fluffy, citrus smelling. I was informed by the awesome bud tenders at 315 North that this batch was a bit more sativa dominant, and I can feel those effects immediately. Uplifted, grinning, creative and motivated/energized. Getting some relaxation but again, I'm als...”"
FireMarshallBill,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1456336,"“Reminiscent of The White we used to get in south Florida in the 90s (I think it's in its lineage) - don't let it's goofy name fool you, this is a killer bud and a balanced hybrid with a solid psychosomatic impact with high thc and cbd levels. Swamp Boys seeds home run!”"

gracethechaste,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1301674,"“I disagree with one of the reviews. I found it indica dominant! Great pain relief I must say! But not one to use if you want to get anything done! I couldn't find a lot of information on it and it seems to be a relatively new strain with impressive lineage. But, as I said, my experience is heavy indica. Couldn't find it anywhere but Inkster, Mi!”"
rtomlin62,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1499644,"“Tina Danza was new to me but puts me in a real nice place. Can get real creative or just flow with the high and drift off to a nice slumber.”"
allstar23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1346642,"“I was lucky enough to come across a legit batch of this great flower. Mine was a good all day smoke although it was good at night too. I was glad I tried this, I would like to grow some of this because it smells so good.”"

rooscruise,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1668398,"“This has me stuck stuck stuck. Took to destroy joint pain and get me to sleep. Mission, success.

This strain is AMAZING! Bought on a whim based on other reviews. It's so good and I have to admit hits me like an Indica with the perfect amount of sativa bonuses.

A phenomenal and peaceful high. Take out on your porch on a summer night and enjoy. 
(Then, enjoy a phenomenal sleep).”"
SteelOvaries,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1672269,"“Didn’t quite care for the taste, but the high was fantastic! It creeped up on me then hit me like a ton of bricks. Pain gone and moderately productive for about an hour at best then i hit a wall and chilled in the pool. Nice”"
tucsonblonde,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1546266,"“Nice melt away of anxiety and a rotten headache after smoking a small bowl. This strain was fairly smooth to smoke and tasty. The buds are a lighter green and large, with moderate density and a good display of trichromes, and it showed up in my head first. I’m an Indica girl mostly, as head highs can translate into jaw clenching, anxiety inducing messes for me, so I use Sativas carefully! This one was lovely! No anxi...”"

JadedTakesThisSerious,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1298781,"“I almost skipped this one, kinda glad I didn't.  Made my eyes watery so that was a nice change.  It also gave me a solid body buzz.  Slightly hard on the lungs by the end of my smoke session.  This one would be a little difficult to get work done while using.  A good anytime of day med.”"
trulyangel,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1500417,"“That fresh pine aroma this strain gives off gets me everytime. It just smells soooooo good. makes me feel like taking a long walk into nature and being surrounded by trees. The taste is also amazing, a real nice earthy flavor with small notes of lemon. BUT the high isn't the best I've had. It does leave you relaxed with a clear mind but it wasn't that potent for me (although I'm not sure what thc percentage I was smo...”"

Alrightdude710,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tina-danza/reviews/1522220,"“A great strain with everything you'd want from a sativa leaning hybrid. The pine smell is very pronounced along with hints of lemon and pungent. Smokes well and tastes great.

When I broke the first nugget open I experienced something I've never seen before. There was bb pellet sized ball of pure resin nestled inside this very tightly packed nugget. The goo was stretching and stringing as I pulled the nug apart. It w...”"

 A very enjoyable euphoric high without couch lock or racing thoughts.
Lasted about 1 1/2 hours from one hit.”"
