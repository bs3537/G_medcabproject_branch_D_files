Afgoo

CaptainPlanet,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgoo/reviews/1417544,"‚ÄúThis weed will make you the calmest, most patient motherfucker in the universe.

vman555,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgoo/reviews/1414341,"‚ÄúGood 'ol Afghani Goo. An early favorite of mine. Very active minded and happy. Used with a vaporizer, the buzz lasts quite long and can get your body active. A cerebral uplift generating from the eyes and front of head, followed by a kicker of a moderate body high. A good overall strain, and I feel can be compared with White Widow.‚Äù"
HiSience420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgoo/reviews/1390640,"‚ÄúWOW! Take a look at these pics after you read this. This 2.5 gram nug of afgoo is mildly dense, mostly the core, but the outer portion is spongy with long brown hairs. Exceptionally pure organic eathy/pine like smell, with a flavor that continues through out the hit. Unlike most strains for me, the exhale still holds its flavor through all the bowl. This smoke is the kind of high you want In the afternoon or for bed....‚Äù"
BakedBuffalo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgoo/reviews/1390644,"‚ÄúThis is my first time trying this bud, so I had no expectations but this strain is a solid indica. Afgoo's characteristics make it a great indica for those who want something heavy, but not something that will completely incapacitate you. The sweet piney smell from this bud is extremely enjoyable. The buds have a noticeable darker, earthier look and the smoke is pretty harsh on the lungs.

ajr819,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgoo/reviews/1344097,"‚ÄúThis is my favorite indica. For those who deal with chronic aches and pains, the almost instant body high that afgoo provides is unlike any other indica strains I have tried. It stimulates the mind for a good hour or two which helps process the day or brainstorm new ideas about life. After a bit of intermittent smoking, bed time or a nap feels great.

Reviewing Afgoo 1 gram Co2 Oil cartridge by Golden Xtra.

THE 71%
CBD 1.25%

Afgoo, simply bliss. This oil should be used before bed or whenever you need to remain stationary I would not recommend driving after smoking the soil it's way too potent.

Afgoo by Golden Xtra is not for the new smoker, it will put you to sleep.

Nicksta18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgoo/reviews/1219387,"‚ÄúCinco-o-dos Afgoo is one of the best type of Afgoo I have gotten. It has a total Cannabinoids of 26.61% .

Anywho this strain left me sleepy and couch locked, so I used it at night before bed. If i use it for night it's great but if I need things done I wouldn't go to this strain.
