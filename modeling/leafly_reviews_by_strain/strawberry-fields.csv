Beginners like me would do well to proceed with caution, as the 19% THC version of this pounded me into hibernation mode like a fruity flavored Mjolnir. Very tasty, but very heavy, I found that less is more with this one, as it gave me a slight headache before dropping into my bed like a rock.

The high comes on within a minute or two from the first puff. It's not one for the "in-your-face" highs. It's a really nice heady buzz, with some body relaxation mixed in. Level-headed, no anxiety, no dozing off. This is a very well rounded strain for getting things d...”"
saalah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-fields/reviews/1289403,"“Great body buzz and reasonably clear-headed. Similar to other reviewers, this was also sold to me as a sativa-dominant strain. I'm predominantly a sativa smoker and was surprised at how awake and energized I was after smoking this hybrid. 

It's a great social smoke, and might become my go-to strain for when I pack up the PAX for a night out.”"
WesNSmithN,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-fields/reviews/1374059,"“This Strain is very surprising starts out with familiar strawberry cough head change then goes into a relaxing Indica sedative like effect but you can't experience the real effects if you don't have the flower the distillate perhaps would be better when vape cartridges catch up in technology”"
Arizontnightmare,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-fields/reviews/1715932,"“I absolutely love the first part of the high of this strain. Relaxed, happy and laughing! It tastes like strawberry pop rocks. But after I fall asleep, I have really weird and panicky dreams that make me shoot awake in fear. Not sure why. It comes down to the strain. I’m sure it doesn’t do that for everyone but that’s a negative on my side. So use with caution! Very wonderful strain other than that.”"

Nice smooth and sweet taste to it. Very nice jar smell! Very pleased with this one, and will purchase at any given time.

Didn't enjoy the experience or the flavor. !st Moxie product I didn't like, but I think it is the strain and not the product. The budder was a good consistency and has a great aroma. I just found the high to be really understated and not enjoyable.”"

Buds are really sticky. I would say it's a great balanced heavy indica but not too heavy to the point where your sleepy/lazy. Has a great euphoric feeling. Became one of my favorites! 🙂”"

Smoked half a blunt of this because my tolerance is pretty low, it creeped up on me after a few minutes I was higher than a kite, which should be expected from me smoking half a blunt with my kind of tolerance.
