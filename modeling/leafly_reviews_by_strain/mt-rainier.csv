Coopdawg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-rainier/reviews/1271693,"“I picked up  half oz of this for roughly $70 and since the first time I rolled it in paper and smoked it, it's been my favorite strain in my recreational habit. It's definitely Indica Dominant and you will feel that immediately. When it hits me I immediately feel the tensions and stress I dealt with throughout the day disappear and muscles loosen up as my body and mind wind down. One of the things I appreciate most a...”"

GhostOfJack,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-rainier/reviews/1237895,"“tried this about 6 months ago, have not run across it since but would buy again.  similiar to jack herer with a bit more relaxation on the end of the buzz.  buds were very frosry and dense for a sativa.”"

This strain leaves no doubt as to what it is as it smells strong from the minute you open up the package. Within minutes the room will take on the smell, woodsy and skunky are great descriptors as the smell is nearly overwhelming. However, once you get past that the bud itself is a dark green and leafy and quite sticky.

While I was expecting a rough drag on the vape, Rainier is fairly mellow ...”"

Definitely a good bud for any situation.
Being a great body high it helps with chronic pain and anxiety”"
hintofkizzle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-rainier/reviews/1362633,"“This strain is unbelievably gentle and puts your head straight on the positive path. It's also good for day time use, especially hiking in a beautiful area in the spring with the world's sweetest and happiest dogs!”"

1800potdoctor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-rainier/reviews/1568595,"“I just recently tried this strain for the first time today. Mt. Rainier is great for daytime use, or a "wake and bake." I smoked one bowl of this strain at 8:50 am and got so high that I didn't come down until 12:30 pm. It's an amazing hybrid, just enough Indica to give you a powerful body high in the beginning, and not make you too tired. I came home and started to write a part of my sociology essay that is due in 9...”"

I gave my husband a few of the best nights of his life on this strain and had a damn good time myself. Lady sexy time approved! I literally can’t use this strain for any other reason... not one I could use out and about.”"
BoogaShuga,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-rainier/reviews/1248919,"“Good active strain, would say more sativa than indica. It was interesting, kind of a "light" high.”"
Robbiewalrus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-rainier/reviews/1326090,"“This strain is so tasty. It smells like Christmas to me somehow, like butter cookies. light colored, frosty nugs with orange hairs. The smoke is delicious.”"
coachrobj,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mt-rainier/reviews/1328316,"“Awesome high.... easily one of my wife and I's favorite strains. Great mix of a head and body high. This is our go to strain for sure.”"
