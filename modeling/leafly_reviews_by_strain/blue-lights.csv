jackeebby1432,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1378821,"“i have never heard of this hybrid before (80% indica 20%sativa) it is very berry like but pungent at the same time. definitely want to keep this in a tight jar or container because the smell is strong as hell & lingers even after its gone. hits you instantly but the feel is addicting and the taste, is phenomenal and is now one of my favorites. although it gave me a small burst of energy, it wasnt too long after that ...”"
shrooma,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1378820,"“Dispensary direct being reviewed, so bear in mind. Unbelievably INCREDIBLY strong high, comparable to shrooms. Holy hell. Smoked on the beach by my house. I walked home and just sat for hours in my room after two hits without even realizing how baked I was and I was just in pure pain-free unbridled bliss. Con: Trip-level effects lead to bad trip level auditory hallucinations. Damn. This is real as hell bud.”"
Blackhawks15,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1371526,"“I put my Blue Lights next to my Blue Dream for comparison sake, the Blue Lights does not smell nearly as much like blueberries as Blue Dream.  On the inhale, I didn't taste much, but on the exhale, I tasted Boo Berry cereal.  This is not a heavy hitting indica like GDP or Platinum OG, but I wasn't bombed out of my tree either.  About a half hour in, I got a burst of energy, so I could see enjoying Blue Lights during ...”"

The blue lights def. carries a good amount of the blue dream, one of my faves.  Never had Northern lights before, so no reference to go from there. Nice blue dream almost blueberry smell, smooth smoke, smooth taste, puts me in a good mood but also makes me pretty sleepy. Decent on the pain help, helps with my depress...”"
Connesuir_G,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1371522,"“This is a hybrid between Northern Lights and Blue Dream.  The medicine I bought was little nuggets, or small flowers. Originally I believed I was getting something more sativa dominant in effect.  The herb is pretty and even has a light blue tinge.  It smells earthy with a fruit pinsol smell mixed in.

It hits pretty quickly. One bowl will allow you to get stuff done and make you euphoric.  The Blue Dream heritage ...”"
NerdyMo420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1343912,"“One of my new favorites! Relaxing and uplifting at the same time-great for stress and depression. Not too relaxing that you become couch locked-gives me a little cerebral boost to get focused on and started with my day.”"
OneLove1Heart,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1572133,"“Starts as a powerful cerebral rush that fades into a narcotic trance of euphoria. Eventually induces sleep as it melts away the days pain, anxiety, and depression. Helps me sleep and wake up ready to go the next day. It's a little heavy for your morning dab (unless you want to go back go to sleep) 😎”"
MMF4336,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1550394,"“Love this strain! Warm and fuzzy!!! Need not say more. Works great on my knee and back pain”"
MMF4336,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1509040,"“Love this strain. Just a nice relaxing smoke that eased a lot of my pain and left me feeling warm and happy. Only thing is, I wish it's effects lasted longer. One of my new favorites”"
blazin520,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1061946,"“Blue Lights is def. one of my faves. It was really dry, but good smoke. Nice smooth taste and smell. I could smoke this and still function daily activity on par!”"
MalibusMostWanted,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1559516,"“I've always loved Blueberry crosses and this is no exception. It smells of sweet berries after being ground up. The hit was berries and menthol. The high was very relaxing and slightly euphoric, taking me a bit of time to fully feel the effects. no paranoia or anxiety at all. Overall a great strain if you would just like to relax and calm down.”"
PolskaQueen420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1563898,"“Great for insomnia and relaxation.”"
Bzjane7,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1343913,"“this strain is pretty great for a nice last pump before the night. as it starts kicking in I get a nice uplifted buzz eventually it mellows out and brings you back down  slowly leaving you at a calm relax mood. If I kept trying to chase that first energetic uplifted buzz it works but eventually you get dizzy and then extremely relaxed. Great for a now calm but exciting day! for me better at night times before I sleep”"

markgarf,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1371528,"“Blueberry Northern Lights  potent and the high was very long lasting. Complete body relaxation with a side of giggles. Tasted like hot blue berries was not let down. This one tested at 23.8% thc”"

Desn818,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1371527,"“Grants a very solid body high for me. Clears my head and mellows me out. Has great taste and smell, a little on the pine-ish side. Not a strain I'd recommend for sleep disorders, but rather for a nice midday functional high.”"
JadedTakesThisSerious,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1255122,"“Had a crumble concentrate of this, tasted like playdoh smells at hit one, then went to a nice berry ish flavor.  Gave me a nice body buzz, tingly even with some couchlock, only down was dry mouth.”"

IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1412556,"“I'd probably still just go with Northern Lights or Blueberry over this, but this is a solid indica strain. Takes on more of its look and scent from the Blueberry, but looks like Blueberry on steroids with more filled out big pillowy frosty buds. Very sedating/relaxing. Good for stress/insomnia.”"

phoenixsun1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1764655,"“Good quality Indica. Definitely can tell it like its parent North Lights. Not the strongest Indica I've had but very good. Will not floor you, but it gives a relaxed, drowsy feeling, so I thought it was good for sleep.”"
Akamu34,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1629089,"“This shit gives you one of the best HIGHS ever!!! Love it”"
doobwalker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1718288,"“Easily THE single strongest Indica I have ever medicated with. Grab your pillows because you are going night night time, for a LONG time. Also mixes very well in small amounts with other hybrids with high CBD content.  But seriously,  if you want to sleep... this is your strain. Chronic insomniacs- get some zzzzzz at last.”"

DaveBuddin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1703336,"“After smoking for over a quarter century I can say this my favorite strain available, possibly ever. But opinions are like.....noses. And they all smell. Seriously tho, if you are looking for a quality indica and prefer fruity flavors instead of sour give this strain a try. A hit or two gives me a great sativa like head high. 4 or more hits and I remember it is an indica after hours of the most pleasant couch/brain l...”"
eriin420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1703985,"“It’s a nice high, but makes you pass out. I could only smoke half a blunt without falling asleep. Also the only strain to ever give me a migraine. Blue dream is wayyy better.”"

WVMike420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1781993,"“Great relaxing buzz with wide awake clarity. Smooth sweet aroma, and lots of flavor. Really easy to grow can be done with great results with little or no LST or training. Produced  roughly 8+ oz of flower per plant indoors using 600w hps lighting and growing in soil/coco mix. Used only fox farms organic nutrients line during vegetative and early flowers cycles. From sprout to harvest was 111 days in my experience.”"

cavali3r,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1674504,"“I’m prefacing this review by making it clear I’m a veryyyyyy self aware person, so the body high I got from this left me disassociating for like 2 weeks after. Which is an awful feeling, if you’ve ever felt it. Anyway. This strain can also make you just move slower, and make it hard for your body to like, catch up with your brain if that makes sense?? I did have pretty bad back/neck pain when I took this and that wen...”"
bluzysedonalady,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1728955,"“I love the taste of the  blue lights strain. It has a little bit of a couch lock that's not so bad that you can't get up but it does keep you pretty sedated which is good for pain and anyone trying to calm their nerves. This is a great strain to do a reset after a lot of sativa. ☆”"
yourfriend_nico,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1493078,"“super relaxing, great for end of day, nap time, before bed. sweet aroma and taste on the greens hit, takes the dense bud structure of classic Northern Lights and adds that beautiful blue tint and blueberry hints credited to the widely popular Blue Dream. if you get a chance, I highly recommend trying it!”"
DomSantiago,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1473347,"“very nice euphoric high. beautiful leafy buds, and nice red hairs. has a frosty tint of crystals coated on every aspect of the bud. my batch smelt like an earthy, and had a fruity pinsol aroma. almost a musty smell in my opinon, but a very good musty HAHA!”"
KbAz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1280826,"“I smoked the "dusted" variety of this strain--dipped in concentrate and rolled in kief. It was very nice, but not worth the $20 I paid for the gram.”"
DonKewsh,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-lights/reviews/1310694,"“Started off with a really strong head buzz then I got me pretty talkative, energetic, and euphoric. 'Twas a good high.”"
