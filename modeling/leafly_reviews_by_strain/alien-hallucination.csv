This strain is a must keep, must have, & forever enjoy experience.  Great Job To H4L, East Mesa Location, AZ. 
By the way it took me ten minutes & auto correct to do this message.”"
GlennFales,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1391076,"“Do you know how on movies and TV whenever someone smokes weed they start hallucinating? We all know that's not true, but if you could have a strain that gives you that feeling, it would be this beautiful bud.”"
jessicakristint,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1382462,"“This is my favorite strain and I always get it when I find it. The effects are very euphoric, creative and uplifting but it doesn't make me anxious. Plus, it smells like Skittles.”"
burningdream,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1382464,"“One of my all time favorites, in just a few hits you transcend into cerebral and amazing high. I just picked up some today in fact! If you see it GET IT!”"
TheAragon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1341839,"“I always thought Blue Dream was favorite strain... Not anymore! Super dense buds that will leave your fingers feeling as is they're covered in glue.

Head-lifting highs that create for the most wonderful music listening experience. Brings you back to where it all began. Don't undermine the indica in this herb either. 50 minutes post-vaping (highly recommend) body felt like the most amazing beanbag you've ever sat on!...”"
Cal777,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1391074,"“Dense Christmas tree style flowers. Smooth smoking.Excellent flavor and aroma. Heady, but not overpowering.”"
blissedoutbabe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1245340,"“Definitely a good one. I really love anything mixed with LSD. After a hit, the effects come on me in like 5 minutes. Like another review said- it's best when you can just chill out, listen to some good music, and get real reflective. I do a lot of art when I smoke this one. Good stuff.”"

shumpy87,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1271706,"“This is a very strong strain that is pretty high in thc and has a very nice relaxing effect that is very nice. I personally like the strains that have a more distinct taste and lean more to the indica side, but if you are into sativa this is a good one for you.”"
e52wi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1379304,"“honestly, we haven't had this strain before today. It didn't happen to be the super dense buds people are talking about, but the super airy hairy buds on the other hand tasted like bruised fermented fruit tea not in the best of taste I'm sticking to the cherry pie x huckleberry that we mix in the grinder.”"
dankitydankk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1608572,"“I pray for the day that the ganja gods bless me with this strain again. Hard strain to find, literally haven’t seen it in 3 years. My absolute favorite. The trippiest strain I’ve ever tried, 10/10 would approve. Amazing for spiritual work and receiving knowledge, especially while looking at the stars”"
MiracleMedijuana,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1275123,"“I very much liked the way this strain made me feel. It decreased my pain enormously and put me into a happy, relaxed,  creative state that lasted for hours until it finally put me to bed.”"
Kooterbrown,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1607220,"“This one hit me hard didn't see it coming. Sat on the porch for 20 mins after I was done smoking just staring at a tree.”"
appleseed30,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1244172,"“I got this from Best Buds in Lansing. As this was my first visit I was really impressed for the quality and friendly service. 2nd visit not as well but still a decent place just be careful on the flower you choose. it may be very dried out. Overall this strain is excellent and its best consumed at night.”"
aonetimenovelty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1269113,"“mild head high. strong relaxed feeling. mellow euphoric feel. easy on the throat and lungs.”"
BeeNash,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1236798,"“At first glance, I noticed this bud. It was super light green in color with red hair's everywhere absolutely covered in crystals. This strain taste wise reminded me alot of strawberry diesel. This bud looks awesome but it smokes kind of light for my preference. Overall I would give this strain a 7.5 out of 10 rating.”"
willfoster2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1318046,"“This strain is incredible. Bag appeal was on point. The buds were covered in crystals and very bright like a asteroid. The effects were euphoric and took me to space.”"

Pestie67,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1302408,"“Aroma-  interesting odor, different than LSD, almost chemically sweet, not overpowering.  Works fast, 10 min. in I was felling it. Look - Nice buds, mine were covered in orange hairs.  BuZz - Came on fast, and strong.  I became Richard Dryfus and formed my mash potatoes into a mountain shape.  Tripped to 3rd Kind, awesome movie on this stuff.”"
DonkeyMeat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1540915,"“At first it was the name that made me interested, me being a syfi nerd it was  going to happen. Anyway this strain is great really nice flavor with a nutty hash taste, really went well with the meal i was having. This strain defiantly is a go getter type of strain with a really energizing feel, really made me want to build things. A fantastic stain for anything active.”"

YungSoose,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-hallucination/reviews/1312292,"“I tried not to let the name overhype me but wow this strain is amazing. I got some great flowers coated in trichomes light orange hairs all over the place. The bids were dense but easy to rip apart spongy almost. I also got the awesome experience of dabbing some of this and let me say best dab I've ever had the exhale was so smooth it tasted so good and it was almost like everything just got brighter and immediately ...”"
