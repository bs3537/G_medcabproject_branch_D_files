Beerblebrox,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/madcow/reviews/1289144,"“This feels like it hits me harder than most sativas, but I still  don't get tired or foggy-headed. Great strain for the active stoner. Less euphoria than some, but plenty of energy without feeling too buzzy.”"
Sensistar31,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/madcow/reviews/1355363,"“Well damn! This strain is top notch! I took a couple nice hits through a small bubbler..............then about 3 minutes later I sat back and enoyed the ride. I swear the leaves on my house plant were moving and the doors and windows were closed. Very euforic as if I had eaten some mild X! Speedy, long lasting buzz towards the end. This is my definition of a perfect buzz considering I luz my Sativas!”"

Mostly heavy, chill feeling with interest in Netflix and obsessing over whether or not to take a nap. Would recommend for an afternoon at the beach or park.”"
