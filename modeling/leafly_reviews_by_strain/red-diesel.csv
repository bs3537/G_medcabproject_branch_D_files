bosieboy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-diesel/reviews/1346096,"“Good strain for some, but this strain can be detrimental in a manic or panicked state. Not my favorite diesel.”"
TokerGanjapreneur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-diesel/reviews/1392979,"“Very distinctive taste. Kind of reminds of a mint and spice Christmas flavour. Personally not one of my favourites but i know some who love it. The high is pretty decent.”"
crazycolton55,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-diesel/reviews/1313304,"“This weed smells toooooo dank and WILL smell through the bag, it is a great christmas weed with a basic green color, and red hairs. When broken up it looks like a mistletoe as it has snowy white crystals on the inside. Smelling like tomato soup, on the inhale it takes on a weird chemical tomato flavor. The high is unbelievably good indica based hybrid high making your body feel right and your mind calm. 4.5/5”"

hawkski86,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-diesel/reviews/1299808,"“Nice strain. It's smoother than sour diesel and has a nice uplifting high. i use it for anxiety, pain, and stress. It helps with the symptoms without causing any sleepiness or agitating my anxiety. leafly says it is not near me but i have purchased this in Anna Illinois at thrive dispensary. So it is, in fact near me and anyone else who goes to thrive anna Illinois.”"

Compared to the sour diesel i have tried this strain was a lot smoother. i tried it out of a water pipe and a regular pipe and didn't have coughing problems. It helps with the anxiety and didn't make me sleepy.”"

rob_amsterdam,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-diesel/reviews/1155721,"“This strain is a sativa-dominant (30/70) that packs a great punch. As a person who smokes indica most of the time I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this sativa. Its become my regular smoke nowadays. Oh, and it tastes great!”"

OGSmokeBoy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-diesel/reviews/1671202,"“Grabbed this off a guy who runs a few dispensaries in Toronto. Not gonna lie, one of the worst strains i have smoked in my life. Wasn't even fazed, just a small buzz that lasted 2 minutes. Could be a bad pack, but the guy has been reliable for 3 years now. Wouldn't recommend unless grabbing in Cali.”"

DukeRaoul,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/red-diesel/reviews/1514077,"“Picked up a gram to try from the dispensary. Wanted to compare to Sour Tangie, a regular fav or mine, to see if I'd like it any better. 

Definitely had more of a diesel flavor and effect. Somewhat racy high. Not the best bud I've had but not bad either. I'll probably go for Sour Tangie or something else given the option.”"

Using fox farm soil I started her late in the year and didn't train her a bit yet she turned out beautiful. Nice pungent flowers that burn well in a joint after only a week in the jar.
