Driad,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1263304,"“Lovely oh lovely Grunk smoke that harrowing my scrung. Dreams that never end. It looks like tomatoes and dough, strain long, grapes apes, snapes cloud killer mom. Pungent ass Dark ass grape ass delicious... tasty nightmare high dream ass

Yeah so it was alright I guess.”"
dapperErl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1366238,"“Holy crap you guys, if you were looking for a top shelf strain, this is it! Phat Panda did a phenomenal job with the Grunk. It's definitely stuff stoners like.”"
Grannie-O,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1357349,"“A nice relaxing strain with a full sweet flavor. Very smooth, not harsh at all. Very calming and relieves stress. Like a mini vacation. I can smoke it and still get some "chores" done. And also smoke it and watch an old movie. I am really enjoying my first experience with "Grunk". Versatile and stoney. Gives me stoner eyes for sure. :) Gonna tuck Grunk into my TOP 5.”"
nenegade,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1389749,"“Please Leafly, splain dis to me!!  You describe Grunk as relieving anxiety yet when I look at the negatives, it falls high on the scale of anxiousness and paranoia.”"
Raum,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1195844,"“This has to be my new favorite strain by a long shot. Perfect two strains to cross in my opinion. The smell, looks, taste, and euphoric high all get 5/5. 

I encourage anyone that comes across this to pick some up for sure.”"
Supermade,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1366564,"“Overall great strain. The high starts in the head and works its way through your body. Mostly a head high for me. The buds are very light colored with some slight dark spots trying to peak through the mass amount of kief. The smell is fantastic, very sweet berry citrus smell with a little bit of skunk. Burns smooth with a great sweet flavor.”"

Don't drive!”"
AinWA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1366566,"“This is one of the best strains I've smoked in years.  I have  forty years of smoking under my belt, and its a rare smoke that hits me hard on the first toke like this does.  Definitely try this one if you are a cannabis veteran like me and find yourself wishing you could get as baked as you used to get way back when.”"
angelrose1987,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1247490,"“I normally smoke Somango as my go to wake and bake/day smoke strain. unfortunately I wasn't about to purchase any and the retail had this in. I love it it's got a creative head high with a nice Mello out. great for pain to. will give you the munchies”"
SeatownHaze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1215865,"“Has a very good taste and nice body high that won't leave you couch locked, but might have you raiding your refrigerator. Love the smell of this one.”"
TheMissJDay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1540778,"“Amazing smell. Very relaxing and takes away anxiety and pain. It is an Indica that is great for day or night. Reminiscent of Purple Urkle. A social buzz.”"
Seli,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1261318,"“Definitely would buy again, helps with pain so much!! Smooth hits! Yum!”"
Avestal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1275467,"“Grunk is a perfect "get your chores" kind of weed. It energizes and motivates you to get up and moving while still letting you be high. If you smoke this strain to sleep you better go to sleep right away or you just may find yourself at the gym at 11:30 at night.”"
DaveHogan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1248840,"“Very upbeat and positive buzz.”"
TobyPetroCamaro,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1338264,"“This strain is real heady, tasty, and smells good.  I would  have to say I this was the first time I have been surprised in over 6 months.”"

nuggsnkisses,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1392672,"“This one snuck up on me. Halfway through the cone and I kept questioning whether I was stoned, which inevitably led to some crazy out of the ordinary thought patterns- thus answering what inevitably was a rhetorical question; YES- I indeed was stoned. Very relaxing high, yet still able to spark the creativity I was looking for; docking a star for taste- not the best.”"
Oregonanalyticalservices,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1409975,"“The Original Grunk can be viewed in the Cannabible  #2. It's a Florida strain, a cross of a very SATIVA heavy Grape and a Skunk #1, not Grape Ape The buzz is extremely racy, puts Green Crack to shame.. I have heard there was another version out there and now it is confirmed.”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1415857,"“Everything's spot on as described. Grape skunk smell and smoke. Neon purple and lime green with neon orange hairs. Top of my list for curing bad moods. Euphoria and happiness does get haunted by bouts of paranoid anxiety. This experience was on a low tolerance. On a high tolerance it's more chill and creative. Less euphoric and noid.

Highly recommend to treat mood disorders.”"

Laewin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1279011,"“Excellent strain! I smoked a variation of this called Crash Grunk, and it immediately alleviated my mounting anxiety. Beautiful purple and pungent scent, though flavor, while mostly absent, was flatter and more chemical than I expected.”"
DayTripper7711,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1201171,"“What a GREAT STRAIN!!!!! Best of both worlds here for sure; I gotta say that the taste is just off the TERPS!”"
bigquayle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1207716,"“This definitely is a high head, low body kinda party. I had a great time being up and creative. It provided some much needed pain relief for my lower back as an added benefit. PS... COCOPUFFS!!!!”"
206BeachBum,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1194344,"“what's not to like about this?!!! 

First whiff..you know what you got is some snuck ass chronic! But beyond the sweet smell ...the texture...totally spongy...looks like christmas in a jar.

the high...for me it's perfect blend of a body high and slight head high. which is what i want from my indica...this does the job...my new fav 

PDizzle”"

tabootTABOOT,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1202001,"“Grunk is Grape x Skunk #1 not Grape Ape x Skunk #1. Grape is much more sativa dominant originating from Florida”"
NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1208515,"“Really nice relaxing strain won't put you straight to sleep but probably better to use this when you don't have a bunch of stuff that needs to get done very tasty can really smell and taste the grape also skunky taste that adds to the whole flavor”"

brianr86,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-grunk/reviews/1235599,"“Thsi was a fun strain that really evolved through time. Started with a real flavorful smoke. Lots of berry notes and hashy skunky pine notes. The high sets in behind your eyes with a nice mental uplift and clear head. Focus is increased and a little body high sets in during the second wave. Creativity and even more body high complete the first 30 minutes. Not a long lasting strain but a real enjoyable experience wort...”"

But now they have flower! I  can't wait to get my grinder ready for a bit of work. And get my bong super clean to smell the beautiful aroma and taste of cannabis I remember as a teenager. 

btw... Issaquah Cannabis Company in Washington State is the best shop around. Selection, prices and most of all, the budtende...”"
