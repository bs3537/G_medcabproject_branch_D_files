Marijuanaguru,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1360799,"“I've been smoking (not like a full on stoner but a few times a week) for about 4 years now and this strain is probably the most powerful I have smoke thus far. For me the affects are almost seconds after the first hit. Its a very good "chill" high but it also is good in party settings, i would recommend for big smokers so you can get the forst high feeling all over again”"
OGiesel97,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1373757,"“I smoked one bowl of this, and I was higher than a kite before it was gone. Unfortunately, I got the munchies, and I got sick from eating too much lol.”"

JackDanieL,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1357467,"“OGiesel is the famed love child of kush chemdawg and some super skunk, and it hits like an 18wheeler in 5th gear.  An immediate, but all-too-fast head rush gave way to a very relaxing body high that I am still riding now almost an hour after that 1st bowl.  Nothing really to write home about as far as appearance - fluffier nugs, probably 4 stars in appearance.  Denser and sugarier of course at their hearts.  Flavor h...”"

stevebravo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1198752,"“Excellent herb ! Love the nice smell it gives off. Nice a potent. Definitely a creeper but keeps you in a happy mood as well !”"
ZENtacular,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1062620,"“Instantly turned unnecessary stress into a happy & euphoric feeling. Took away any feelings of worry or anxiety & made me laugh at almost everything- which is always awesome :) The high lasted for almost an hour.”"
Marijuanaguru,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1229238,"“also i felt very sick prior to smoking and the moment after i smoke the pains all went away so medically it seems to work very well”"

erack1975,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1561285,"“This is a strain that nade me dance...wtf?! I feel fucking awesome! Man O! MAN! I feel great!....anyway, itts a good one. Please try it for yourself”"
TheWord,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1062606,"“Super Dank buds. This is an uplifting hybrid a bit similar to sour og but stronger. If you cross the line and puff too much, I find it can lead to mild anxiety that lasts about an hour followed by a semi-couch lock indica type high. Just the right amount however, leaves me feeling happy, social and energetic (in a good way, not a speedy sativa type way). Overall, its a quality medicine.”"
four20phil,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1062604,"“OGiesel is my all time favorite hybrid, and it should not be surprising.  The exciting blend of the smoothest OG Kush and the most potent Sour Diesel only has the potential for excellence! Enjoy your high with this one!”"
Yanete,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1660137,"“I smoked one bowl of this through a bong and had a rlly strong high throughout the night. Very nice strain.”"

XoraKJoken,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1062613,"“I picked up a quarter of O'Giesel (OG Chemdawg x Diesel) and have been delighted by it. The high is incredibly uplifting, very euphoric, and yet still has hints of being pain relieving. A wonderful daytime medicine if ever there was one.”"

PipersReviews,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1254704,"“A total creeper strain. It'll get you nice and stoney with a nice body note also. You'll know your high with this Ole girl she's worth a smoke totally. Good group toke this one is. Get you talkative and such.”"

stonerchick69blazin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1561236,"“OGiesel! I picked up an ounce of this to play with. It is a true hybrid. Very piney and earthy. It hits with a body relaxation. My muscles feel like they're less tense but my mind is awake. I'm more focused, feel creative, and like I could do a light yoga sesh or walk the dog. This strain gives me munchies if I haven't eaten recently. I feel happy but not super giggly. Good solo strain in my opinion.”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1062618,"“Got this strain in my new vape pen. Great for day time use when you really need to get thungs done. Nice even body high with a warm and focused feeling in you head.”"
Skiddy4600,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1627117,"“Very strong strain, reminded me of my first time smoking weed. Felt very relaxed but still fairly focussed. I was able to play games pretty easily. Perfect for in the evening after a long day at work or during a nice summer day. Smells very strong even when it's bagged up. I had it in 2 plastic sealed bags and in a metal tin and could still smell it.”"
Mex420x,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1149607,"“Coming from a indica lover. I love the smell obviously but the taste with my volcano vap was a GREAT tasting very similar to (Sour) Diesel but the BODY high,indica part,was not super strong in da couch such has GDP or other grape and Indicas but just enough to still be mobile and up like sativas tend to do versus Indicas”"

if I find different looking ogiesel i will try one more but this one is not good even don't make me high”"
MangOneHundred,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1173161,"“Hillside Medical. 1/8th for $60. This bud grew on me. It smells just like the name - faint hints of OG, but you can tell it's not pure OG. Color is slightly slighter and fewer orange hairs than OG Kush. 

The effect is a creeper, but not BAM like other sativas. Imagine a muted version of Sour Diesel with the body high of a decent OG Kush. That's would this would be.

Not the best bud, but it's very appropriate for cl...”"

oglos420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1314337,"“One of those strains that save the day. I had mild pain and I was feeling down. After 15-20 mins I was uplifted and my pain was reduced. I felt like myself again. It was very crystal and sticky. the first couple of hits were so tasty, it tasted like the wax vape smoke.”"
Phenom,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1062599,"“Vaped ~0.5g of it. Very mellow high that just creeps onto you. Does not seem to impair cognitive function too much.”"
Phenom,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1062612,"“I enjoy the relieving properties of this strain for anxiety. Only thing I dislike is the lack of significant high. Very good for a daily use, but I'd be interested in a bud with a bit more euphoric feeling.”"
turbogtx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1268532,"“Slightly above average for pain and insomnia.”"

NurseMaryJane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1255915,"“Beautiful trichomes on this! I agree that it's a creeper, it usually takes a few minutes before I start to get a euphoric feeling. It makes time seem like it's going by slower, which is actually nice. A really chill high that I personally think is best for evening use. It is good for doing moderate activities with but after a few hours I'm ready to hit the hay....hard.”"

MarijuanaWriters,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogiesel/reviews/1252656,"“This strain made love inside of my mouth instantly. a truly delicious experience that I would recommend any connoisseur of fine cannabis. Truly a hybrid experience which will be unique to each individual and where you acquire your cannabis from, but a very tasty treat regardless. Easily this strain can become one of my favorites very quickly.”"
