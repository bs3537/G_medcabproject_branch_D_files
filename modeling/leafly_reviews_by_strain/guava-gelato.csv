While we were looking at some sativa flowers the word Gelato caught the corner of my eye on the hybrid shelf.

I actually got this over the summer and was just floored by it, and have been looking for it ever since. You see it, definitely give it a try. Relaxing without making you couch locked, yet keeps you alert and on task. Great great GREAT strain”"

SolracAvalon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/guava-gelato/reviews/1761999,"“I suffer from anxiety and tend to stray away from anything with low CBD content.  But this was a complete euphoric & happy high which made most of my day more tolerable.  0 paranoia which also worries me about certain hybrids.

Highly recommend for those looking to feel light on the feet, get creative and still get some shit done!”"

As soon as I opened the bag it smelled like a tropical swisher sweet or something..all I could thing was “Maui Maui!” Extremely potent with a distinctive smell. First 3 hits run thru the entire body and you fall into an instant state of relaxation. You almost feel like you took a shot or 2 if your favorite liquor. This weed is da shit!...”"
