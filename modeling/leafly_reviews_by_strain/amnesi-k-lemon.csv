Amnesi-K Lemon
=============
DaGoF,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/amnesi-k-lemon/reviews/1524152,"“Amnesi-K is a sativa hybrid with a very special smell (sweet and "sour") and a sweet pink flavor with acidic flavors. With great power of growth and flowering.

The brain effect is clean, with creative thoughts and leaving a good physical sensation (no stone efect).

Outdoors it is easy to grow giving large buds full of trichomes. Amnesi-K is a cannabis strain that must be cultivated once in a lifetime.”"

Since it was my first hydroponic culture, I decided to grow first the Amnesi-K seed so that, in case I fucked things up, I wouldn't lose a "good" seed. It turned out to be a monster plant! Guys, This is the best strain I have grown and smoked so far!! Its taste: passion fruit. Really pure PASSION FRUIT...”"

Reminded me of the high I got from Trainwreck. Very euphoric and energized, got right off my butt and started cleaning the whole damn house. Highly recommend this one.”"
