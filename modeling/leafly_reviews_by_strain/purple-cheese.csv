IandI,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-cheese/reviews/1349658,"“Super stony. Good sedating, but don't expect to do shit. Seriously. This is night time weed. A highbred, but hits like a full Indica with steam behind it. Girlfriend had nasty monthly cramps and now she is singing Prince songs and dancing (there's no music playing). Good stuff.”"

dirtybongwater,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-cheese/reviews/1371259,"“Purple cheese, this strain is by far one of the best I have came across, it is one that will clear your mind while giving you a happy & euphoric feeling throughout your whole being. You get creative, you get open-minded, and you just have a good time.  Unfortunately, there are some negatives to it. While it does not make you very hungry, it does give you a dry mouth. While that may be a problem, it still doesn't ruin...”"

The smell is not strong at all, it's very compactly grown but easy to crunch/grind. You can definantaly feel it's a good mix bitween Indica and Sativa. The best Hybrid i have ever smoked.

It's very expensive in a official coffee shop (14 Eu...”"

I smoked a small bowl and I'm really medicated right now.  Very strong head high that feels euphoric and cloudy. It's also very mind numbing, which is good for people with insomnia like me. It's really slowing me down, but in a good way. The high feels similar to that of Granddaddy Purps, but way strong...”"

I never wanted to try a "cheese" strain, because honestly it sounded gross, but I gave in, and very happy I did. It's not even that bad smelling, definitely different but not bad. Great for anxiety, insomnia, pain. It's a hybrid but definitely indica dominant. Gets me super stoned. Comes from two great strains, blue cheese and lowyander(sp?.)
