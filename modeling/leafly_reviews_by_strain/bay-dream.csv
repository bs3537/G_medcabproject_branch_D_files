ECCMassive,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-dream/reviews/1416683,"“Bay Dream is wicked...couple of puffs is all ya need...go for a walk or a jog after you partake & get focused...then hit the couch with your pad & charcoal & get messy. Or maybe catch some Game of Thrones or Californication action. Or go fishing. Or go for a swim. Point being its a great high to mate with just about any activity you're into.
Tastes and smells truly excellent...kinda sweet yet zesty...maybe a lil grap...”"
Platinum556,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-dream/reviews/1378796,"“Wtf this is ridiculously potent stuff. I made the mistake of hitting Bay dream by loud vape wax from mari J's highway pot shop in Everett, before work. I was a paranoid wreck for the first 15 minutes but once I found my stride I did more work in one shift than I normally do in a week. I have a high tolerance so something that is potent in small doses is magic.”"

Nswiatek,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-dream/reviews/1212432,"“Went through a great grow cycle with this strain. While some of my other Sativa's had received a small amount of PM, the Bule Dream Plant was immune. 

I grew them with a 5x5x8 foot Gotilla Grow Tent. I use only 5 gallon buckets with a special CoCo mix I created. I uses PH balancing Sensi Grow advanced nutes as my base. I ran a 18/6 veg cycle and in one month was FORCED to flower due to size. They were averaging an i...”"

IKnowWeed,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-dream/reviews/1262871,"“Very clear, immediate sativa effects.  The buds were a little leafy, VERY very sticky, and lime green with more purple calyxes towards the interior.  Def. looked like a blue dream cross (muted lime green/peachy pistils).  Smell and taste were slightly hashy, earthy, and sweet.  Reminiscent of the quintessential Hawaiian strains.  Found in Maple Valley, WA from a private grower.”"
Snoop707,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-dream/reviews/1371810,"“ill start off by saying every strain affects people differently, but for me this was a bad decision. all it does is make me extremely tired. extremely potent, and all i smoke is concentrate. I have ADD/ADHD and PTSD, I don't know if that's what made the difference but if you struggle with any of those things this strain may not be for you”"
SeatownHaze,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-dream/reviews/1216288,"“Good strain to light up in the afternoon (4:20). Kept me goin with a nice balance between a high in the body and a high in the head.”"
MilksopManatee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-dream/reviews/1591462,"“4.5 stars - I cannot begin to explain how much I love this strain. This is exactly what I needed to kick my anxiety to the curb and get shit done. It can make you a little dizzy if you go overboard but it's not a unpleasant dizziness, if that makes any sense. I'll definitely be purchasing more of this strain in the future!~”"

He suggested I give up the blue dream for now and give the BAY Dream a try. So I did. We did. My husband and I... we had a solid puff 2hr before bedtime. It was one of the cleanest, happiest most euphoric highis! Truly enha...”"
