barnell27,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-dream/reviews/1357545,"“I purchased a gram of white dream from the Giving Tree Wellness center. . The effects I received were more towards the upper sativa side.  I was aware/focused, a bit euphoric, stress free, and relaxed. Not a heavy hitter at all and didn't have me fully where I wanted to be (which is the reason for 3 stars.  The aroma of White dream is pungent and very sweet with beautiful trichs.”"

This a great daytime strain or a good strain to do when you get home from work.   Very relaxing yet energetic strain.  This strain is deffinetly a stress reliever, very uplifting.

OperaGhost,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-dream/reviews/1646590,"“I highly recommend Cloud 9 across town if you haven't been yet. Bought a nice nickel of some there -- incorrectably being sold as 'White Water' -- but is in fact actually 'White Dream' = white widow X blue dream. And baby...it's mmmhmm omg'sh enjoyable. Can be intense, but not hard to master. It's definitely fast. Definitely a sativa dominant hybrid. Peak usually around an hour.

Booya”"
