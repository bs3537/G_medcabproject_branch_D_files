jabbawockeez,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-jack/reviews/1412128,"“It smells like Jet Fuel and has a smooth creeping clear high. The strain will make you very energetic but also make you hella paranoid. This is an alternative to adderall as a study aid, because it gives you hyper focus, so for its perfect for programmers. I bought a 32g OZ (4 extra grams for first patients) for $125 from SRC Wellness Group in La Puente, CA.”"

I rarely felt the need to re-energize with a coffee or redbull, just a few puffs and I had renewed energy and stamina! This is a strong strain, one of the strongest sativas I've ever smoked actually, and a new friend of mine felt extremely anxious from this so I definitely do NOT recommend this for those of you who overthink or are edgy naturally...”"

I'm not usually impressed by sativas, but this one surprised me. 
First off, the buds were a gorgeous, deep green hue speckled by burnt sienna hairs and a fuzzy, off yellow coating of kief. They were mostly loose and small buds. Flower's aroma was very pungent and slightly chemical, like lemon Pine Sol. 
Burned at a very good rate, taste was sour/chemical/lemon, not unlike skun...”"

It's an excellent strain if you are into a balanced hybrid that is "big" in both departments.  The smell is similar to Grapefruit strain, or any of the big citrus bombs.
