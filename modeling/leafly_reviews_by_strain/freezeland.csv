PaquinQC,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1387328,"“Lets talk about Freezeland. I live in Quebec, and that province was born with freezeland lol, that kind grow everywhere around our city and you can get a good bag for nothing I mean try to find a 7g for 25$ its easy. Freezeland is a good strain has a sativa dominant with a good constant cerebral high. Rate 7/10 for me. Good outdoor strain.”"
PaquinQC,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1396992,"“The trouble with that kind is when your use to smoke kush and now you smoke freeze, you need a little more to get a good high, but when it hits you, you feel good and not too lazy. Got beats on my head with music and nothings better than a couple minute of relaxation.”"
CaptainAwesomeDerp,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1338473,"“Pretty much the cheapest bud seen around for me. Decent quality. Don't pay much money for it though, it's not worth it.”"
leaflysupporter,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1354384,"“This strain is readily available at KW Dispensary here in Kitchener, Ontario. A fantastic deal at 49 dollars for a 7 grams with tax included! A strong strain that was tested in a lab to find that it contained 23.07% THC and 1% CBD. I highly recommend this strain for stress relief, pain relief, and insomnia.”"
Alexis33,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1334872,"“In brief, good vibes. Feeling so much more happy. Ive tried planty of weeds but this one is by far the best I've tried with the best taste too. Also really cheap which makes it number 1.”"

Bon weed pour le prix”"
mattr42024,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1554055,"“A really pleasant indica. I don't feel quite as "baked" with this one as with something like Granddaddy Purp, but Freezeland stands out to me as a very focused and relaxing strain. This strain boosts focus and productivity, so it's awesome while doing work.”"
tommydido,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1484873,"“It melts your face off. Has a great taste, I wouldn’t know now though, my face is melting”"
RasJohn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1200029,"“Freezeland is known for being a sativa dominant "biker weed" from Quebec, allegedly getting its name from the strains ability to withstand the autumn frost.
It has a very distinctive, minty pine smell that would probably work well as a men's fragrance. The taste would be lauded by menthol smokers. Freeze is also characterized by small, green, feather light buds.

As a discount weed, it packs a powerful cerebral punch...”"

Crazytoms,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1343007,"“I just bought a 7g. It's a good strain. It litteraly smell like some oranges. Give you a nice smooth high. 

It's a kind of weed for someone who doesn't smoke a lot.”"
PotDonutLover,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1197743,"“This strain indeed lives up to its name, you can feel something cold on the back of your head, then it takes a very firm grasp and makes u sleepy, its a little bit panicky, its a firm knockout in big doses. 
The name is quite fitting because it induces a sort of stillness thats like very consistent, to me if felt like being over dry and stone cold place. If it hadnt made me anxious it would have been better.”"
HowToWeed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1354385,"“I'm an experienced smoker and I love this stuff. The woody and pine taste is what really did it for me. brings me back to when I used to climb trees, now I'm smoking them. The high isn't super strong, so it's good if you don't want to get fucked up. Just very nice and relaxing.”"

nervesalad,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1243924,"“takes quite a bit to get you high but that's what i like about it. can smoke a bunch without becoming a potato, and is the most active strain i have tried (though i haven't tried many). usually i smoke a very small amount and i have a great time; i laugh, dance, and am able to complete tasks. pretty good for pain although i do not experience clinical pain, and i can see why some may get panicky on this. for me it's j...”"

Tweegy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1067176,"“It's strong. Cheap and strong.
Don't go all out if not used to weed. Been smoking for couple weeks and love it. Makes you very social but lean back at the same time. 
You should know the high is pretty hard to dissimulate.”"
alexis.grenier.54,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1148778,"“I liked the effects. Lots of laugh, felt relaxed but not sleepy at all. Not too hungry which was perfect! I highly recommand for people who wants to relax and watch funny video have a very good laugh.”"
fucksakes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1796692,"“I grew Big Freeze and Freezeland X Durban Poison (BeanHoarder genetics).
Vigourous plants, but VERY photo sensitive. I dropped from 20 hours to 12 for 5 days to initiate flowering, then flip back to veg. But 3 of the 11 females I had between the 2 strains didnt reveg. They stuck in flower even tho I raised the daylight hours back to 20. So if you plan to grow, be careful not to bounce the photo period. The breeder su...”"
Greg77,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1248678,"“Great for outdoor growing up north . Really resistant strain that can be crop early . Not the best high ever , low thc % but real nice taste . If you can get this at a great price, go for it .”"
BEINER,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1358563,"“cheap, flavourful, seedy ugly. horrific to smoke good for vape.  takes a lot to get high”"
mknugget,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1385965,"“I got 4g for 20 so not too bad.I did not know what to expect. I took at least 20 bong hits it got me high but not very.

I rolled me and my gf a joint each to go to the movies. We did not get high at all.
I would not recommend this strain to anyone.”"
klampheat1996,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1380229,"“Love this strain great for before
 work and before bed.”"
detective_muffins,https://www.leafly.com/indica/freezeland/reviews/1334873,"“Absolutely great for casual highs and for beginners. Really pleasant effects, and really hard to green out on.

The downsides are : this isin't a great strain to get really high on.
Also, to get a decent high, if you are a little overweight or you are used to the effects of cannabis, you need to smoke a lot of this.

I really recommend it if you can have a good price for it”"
