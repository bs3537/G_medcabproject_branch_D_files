Sirius Black
=============
currentkarma,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1382048,"“Undeniably beautiful strain in person! It is solid purple/black throughout the buds with the stems even being a deep purple. Truly a sight to see! Smokes nice & smooth as well. If you ever see it at a dispo be sure to grab at least a gram to hang on to as it always sells out within a day or two in my experience.”"
Smokey8ear,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1412518,"“Deep black and purple buds with a surprisingly bright aroma. Indica body high alongside some sativa cerebral effects, but without any of the paranoia or panicky effects in large doses. Magical strain. RIP Padfoot.”"
trippytaoist,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1395492,"“Smoked half a joint of this with a friend and started laughing furiously- the way Sirius does on his WANTED posters in The Prisoner of Azkaban. After finishing the joint I began to feel a bit like a scruffy and scary-looking dog, ready to defend the Chosen One from any harm that might come to him from the forces of darkness. This strain fucked me up- in a good way, mind you.”"
cmattar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1332298,"“One of my favorite strains. Glad it's local too! Very nice taste, kinda grapey to me, which is cool bc tbh most strains just taste like a** on the inhale in my opinion. This gives a nice indica body high while the head is weighted, but creative and free. Great for socializing! I was anxiety free and funny. Music sounded great, and this strain in flower still produces a significant high after doing a dab or two! Only ...”"

iTREY,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1331647,"“Smoked this for 3 days straight and it packs a punch. The taste is sweet, and so is the smell. Excellent body high and leave you STUCK.”"

Waltermay2013,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1366806,"“Some of the best weed I've smoked in two or three years. It gives all that it promises. Gentle, euphoric and easy on the throat.”"
Meatweapon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1394571,"“So, I bought this strain partly for the fact that it was an indica with a lower thc percentage, a decent amount of cbd, and, well, honestly... it was kind of a novelty, thing. Ive had Black Afghan and i had gotten it for the low thc and indica factors as well, but also, like Sirius Black, the novelty of it being so fully purple as to appear black. its different. cool. exciting. intriguing. major bag appeal and people...”"
deeepfried,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1331648,"“it's as dank as it is beautiful.
Definitely one of my favorite weed smoking experience's. It's literally all purple. sells out fast recommend you get it if you have the chance. its only sold in Oregon though I think so it's pretty rare.”"
Loesol,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1473366,"“I thought I had reviewed this but to my mild shock I had not. The reason you ask? Because it's just that good. I'm a med patient that use various products and strains. The first thing you notice is that this isn't just a lighting trick. This is a brilliant purple. The buds are compact but not small. Out of the bag you get the fragrance. It isn't a smell boys and girls. I did a corse grind and it opens it up and the s...”"
chibiusagi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1714383,"“Best strain I have ever smoked in my entire life! I have complex PTSD so I unfortunately experience mood swings, dissociation, paranoia, anxiety and depression. After one bong hit of SB, my mood was lifted, I was very calm and felt a nice buzz but was mentally present. Absolutely no paranoia throughout my entire high (had more later) and no negative thoughts. Highly recommend!”"
wwillard503,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1784157,"“Saw this strain in a giant jar about 15ft away as soon as I walked thru the door of cola cove in Tigard, OR. I’ve never seen any strain this dark that was of higher quality. Swooped a gram instantly, grinded and twisted up, definitely lives up to its reviews. Bout a third of the way in and I’m lit. Truly a creative strain, and starting to catch my self rambling on here. At a lower 17.97% thc and being this stoned I w...”"
djshoemaker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1372859,"“I am generally prone to a good sativa or at least a sat-dom strain. The color purple and the grape aroma and I just had to try Sirius Black. Nothing at all to do with my secret love of the HP series. Not so secret now, I have to say that I was quite taken aback with Sirius Black! I had an energetic head high and a relaxing body high which allowed me to sit. And write. And take a fun photo. Bonus that it's grown here ...”"

juliet2525,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1366807,"“I am by no means a weed connoisseur.  But this is hands down the best strain I have ever found. I have the hardest time sleeping. This knocks me out. But not before a really euphoric couple of minutes. It's wonderful.”"
djshoemaker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1384415,"“Right on! You used my photo for the banner shot! The smiley face baby grinder helped, I bet. 
As for the review, inLOVE the smell and taste! Like grapes when full budded, but grinder brings out more earthy tones. It also acts more like a sati and dominant hybrid with me. Lately, I have also been mixing this strain and Rude boi and cherry pie, and what a high!! Sailing creative relaxed! Ahhh!”"

And brain surgery peps this one calms the seas.... This is a very pleasant smoke and smell is out of this world:) and the color well I sure do like Purple!!! Enjoy!”"
Daylightlady,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1366805,"“This is the best tasting smelling Marijuana I have ever had. Also It has helped me so much with my pain from surgery... Really source of good pain relief.”"
Eighty8,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1338507,"“Really Dark purple(black). I showed this to a couple of friends and they were blown away by how dark this stuff is.
Smell is great, has an orange/citrus smell and the nugs are super dense. I almost wanted to stop smoking because it lasted so long lol. Really nice head and body high, made me appreciate the things I have in my life. if you see this, try it out, you won't be disappointed.”"
charliebell95,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1349959,"“My favorite indica right now. It is one of the smoothest smokes I have ever had. It tastes sweet kinda fruity and after one bowl, I'm typically very squinty in my eyes and ready for bed.”"

horacefarbuckle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1366804,"“I'm not a sophisticated connoisseur, nor an experienced smoker, so take that for what you will. I'm just a medical user who's had some bad anxiety-related effects from anything with a hint of sativa in it. But SB is smooth as glass. Happy, anxiety-free thoughts dominate, with a solid pain-relieving body high. Looks super cool as well -- it's metal AF. Definitely a keeper.”"

Hgomes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1572339,"“I love this strain it is delicious and beautiful. You can't help but stare at this gorgeous purple bud and when you break it up there is a moment where you hesitate. Should I roll it? It looks too pretty to smoke, but when you start you want to savor it. One of the best indicas I have EVER had and I cannot wait to visit Oregon again just for this strain. 🌿❤🌿❤”"

RecontraBacan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1367872,"“This strain is a no-brainer 5 stars for me. Effect is like taking a Xanax or Klonopin tablet. Mellow and pain killing without a lot of sedation. No anxiety/paranoia whatsoever, but uplifting in a sativa kind of way--and this from a guy who is susceptible to it--I usually have to cut even a great indica like granddaddy purple with some high cbd strain to mellow it out. Not with Serius Black. Tastes like grape gum--I'm...”"

vapedis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sirius-black/reviews/1674908,"“Awesome strain. Strong earthy flavor but very smooth. The strain name was not stolen, members of the Oregon Breeders Group have been working on this strain since the 90's when it was known as serious black, because when people saw it they would say "whoa that is seriously black". Funny people who've been in the game less than a decade think they invented a strain that's 3 decades old. Even funnier that leafly would l...”"

It looks crazy with that dark purple/black color. 
It smells crazy with an intense sweet grape scent like nothing I have ever smelled before! 
It tastes crazy with a light sweet mint grape flavor that never gets old!
