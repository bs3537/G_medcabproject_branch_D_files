I have had bouts of paranoia when smoking in the past and as a result I tend to choose low THC strains and have a low tolerance. I was nervous about this strain but after using it a few times, I am in love. It creates such a relaxing high and works very well for my pain but at the same time ...”"

But the taste was this sweet blend of bitter mocha, reminiscent of coffee. Sweet on the pull and smooth on release. I could smoke this all day, but more importantly I can smoke this all day and still function. I liken it to a sedating cup of coffee in my mornings.”"
RWright,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/la-chocolat/reviews/1509444,"“Overall decent bud, got at 31pct.  I don't have the greatest nose in the weed world, but thought I could taste and smell a little chocolate flavor on the exhale.  Effects lasted close to 3 hours.  Good for anxiety, pain, depression and overall mood.  

Can function very well on this strain during daytime use and will buy again.”"
