pingaswarrior77,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-kush/reviews/1389778,"“Definitely one of the best strains I've ever tried. Flowery sweet aroma, mixed with a woody, earthy undertone. taste is kinda unique, similar to a powerful AK, very strong taste with sweet and flowery undertones, but not too harsh. The come-up is slow and comfy, it starts off in the head and you can feel it just settle out in your body, for a nice deep body buzz(I seriously felt that heavy comfy buzz in my legs and b...”"
