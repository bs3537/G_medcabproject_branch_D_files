Buds are very frosty with a very nice fruity spice type smell, I also noticed some purple within the buds.It's good to smoke when you have nothing to do and you really want to relax but not get sleepy. Burns very nice too with a more spice earthy flavor. Definitely one of my favs”"

MoonstoneConnection,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-death-star/reviews/1432700,"“A tight strong smelling flower worthy of the federation. A strong terpin taste indicates this was not grown on Hoth. More likely cultivated on Scarif.  A very solid Indica bud. Tasty and a mellow buzz of decent length.”"

Labman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-death-star/reviews/1390074,"“This Sweet sticky bud, had me at Pink ! Don't plan much after a bowl or two , you will be couch locked. Pink Death Star comes on strong and peaks very nice after a hour or so. The tiny bud is very deceiving but , yea , all systems go .”"

A great strain to smoke before bed, it will having you melting into your sheets like a piece of butter. Each bud looks like a miniature death star, with it's pink/purple hues, packing enough energy in it to take down a star. Grab this when you can, it will quickly become one of your favourite indicas. 

Wood Strain?
Yes.”"
GreenGirl902,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pink-death-star/reviews/1624803,"“Just smoked a joint of Pink Death Star about 10 minutes ago. The flavours are rich -- I'm tasting kinda "toasty" earthiness, very spicy, with a savoury aftertaste in the back of my throat that's similar to mussels. It's giving me a chill and relaxed feeling, relieving tension in my head. This seems nice for late nights or calm afternoons.”"
