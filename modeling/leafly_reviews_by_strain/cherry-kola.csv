This is a great indica definitely nighttime use, but at the same time definitely a must try especially for Depression, PTSD, Anxiety, Insomnia and such, works great! This is my first time with this strain and I'm glad I got such a dank batch, all enjoy!”"
chewy420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1417494,"“This is a truly unique strain. For this review i grinded up some fine Cherry Kola buds and put them into a Magic Flight Launch Box. First off is the amazing aroma that hits you in the face and fills the room completely. This flower literally smells like cherry cola... its so tangy and direct... it's amazing what smells nature can produce. The first draw completely coated my throat in a greasy cherry/tangy flavor for ...”"
unherduf,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1367023,"“As a cluster headache patient, this strain is an excelente choice and a more efficient medicine to counterattack the hardcore pain that us clusterheads have to endure. There has been no medication or combination of pharmacos that has worked for my condition better than this strain. For those cluster-headache sufferers out there, this strain can replace sumatriptan, tencon, fioricet and many others at the time of clus...”"

When I say stupid high I mean you have no sense of awareness; was cleaning dishes and just spilled water everywhere after I had smoked half of a J of CK. Overall great strain, definitely felt euphoria and relaxness. 
Sometimes I find indica strains easier to get stuff done and focus on larger tasks such as cleaning a room/ mowing a yard/ playing video...”"

I got ahold of some Black Cherry Kola and it was the only strain I've ever seen stop a panic attack mid-panic. It works greattttttt for anxiety and panic, induces a sense of calm and wellbeing, helped out my pain some, and was just all around wonderful. If I saw it again I'd get it again every t...”"
MoshuaJulks,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1393577,"“ABSOLUTELY my favorite INDICA strain! Has an amazing high that alleviates not only chronic pain, but also helps with stress and anxiety. The smell and taste are unique and MEMORABLE, leaving a potent aftertaste and feeling. This is a TOP SHELF strain that will call you back again and again.”"
cancereater,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1357927,"“smells like cherry cola gummies, delicious!  The smell in the air after a hit has a zang to it, almost like the cherry cola (Roy Rogers) turns into a Shirley Temple since it has a more citrusy aspect to it.

This indica seemed much more like a sativa.  I didn't get much body effects from it, and the type of head high was not really of interest to me.

Had some Granddaddy Purple a few hours before, and that one was wa...”"
ManuGibrobili,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1357926,"“Probably my favorite strain. Absolutely love the taste. Would recommend for anyone with insomnia or severe pain. Definitely a very strong indica.”"
Lv80Bootsie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1390478,"“I have chronic pain in my back, and depression and this strain really centered me! I don't take my mess anymore due to the option of smoking, but this strain by far! She's so sweet and smooth and cradles you gently into euphoric calms. I didn't feel to paranoid but rather fidgety and got a lot done ha! But I highly recommend if you are in a funk and have pain, take back control of your body! Get productive again.”"
JahLivingston,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1345224,"“Beautiful looking buds, the color is amazing. Smell and taste is just as good, a heavy hitter for sure.”"
cherrykola,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1351902,"“The name definitely speaks for itself, the scent & flavors are in between cherry coke & kush.  The organic flowers I received were nicely crystalized, even though a little dryer than I like my buds, none the less a delicious find to smoke in any manner, very flavorful out of a heady glass spoon.  I love the energetic, focused, keep your pep effect it gave me!”"
0purplekushgod0,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1345225,"“Very relaxing and smooth hits. Calming and very tasty. Does taste a bit like the after burp of soda but that might just be me, I like it :)”"
mastaT,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1263841,"“Never smoked this strain before. When I saw it at my local dispensary I had to get it. No regrets there! amazing taste and a real smooth smoke. nice head high.
 Would buy again for sure but from the looks of it not to many dispensary's carry it.”"

SmokemonG0,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1339188,"“Super powered Indica! Has a strong pungent smell that strangely reminds me of Sour Diesel.. The flavor pairs well with the similarly named soda, especially when your mouth dries up after smoking this frosted dense bud. Indica usually makes me nauseous and dizzy but this one has me just chillin with a big grin that I can't seem to get rid of.”"
fourslice,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1269764,"“A strong heavy smoke with a slightly chemical/automotive taste, it provides a heavy high that comes on quickly and settles in like a wet Mexican blanket. 

Enjoy with a cold Arizona Iced tea (Strawberry Half and Half recommended) and some Property Brothers.”"

The pollen catch on my grinder was FULL of good stuff]!)                  Central California outdoor for about $20. Now, being outdoor (and probably not treated with proper respect and maintenance), this was not the best batch I could have found.                                     So why did I give it 4 stars?

SBWILEY,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1197969,"“This is a very nice strain, and has a very nice flavor of cherry cola. There is a strong buzz to follow! However the buds are not very dense! 
 a little fluffy for my taste.”"

We have been trying new stuff just about every time we go to the store and this stuff really stuck out to us. Very giggly, playful , fun high. I have also been productive with this strain.

I decided to play some L.A. Noire when I smoked this. Then I had the munchies to the max. I'd recommend it if you got good budtenders.”"
JCool,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cherry-kola/reviews/1209118,"“Now I must say this strain was refreshing at the start of the day. No actual complaints because...HEY...it's herb. 

With that said, the thrill stops there. I'm much of a frequent smoker as I enjoy the lifting ride, the medicinal benefits, and the familiar aroma of sweet pungent bliss...but the ride didn't get anymore interesting the more you stuck around.

Once adjusted the lung expansion is calming and not overpowe...”"

I'm pretty sure this bud strain isn't to common as I've only seen it once. Feels like a cougher when taking the hit, but smooth once exhaled. This is probably one of my favorite strains, alongside girl scouts, and lemon haze.”"

It doesn't muck very much with your brain but you're left with that feeling that it's all going to be ok and in the end, life is amazing. I took it for some massive pain that usually aspirin or t3's can't handle. So far, she's holing up very nicely.
