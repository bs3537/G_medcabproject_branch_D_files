cascadianmass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/peaches-and-cream/reviews/1363646,"“An Indica leaning hybrid, this Super hybrid is a culmination of four strains, None of which tastes like peaches. Peaches and Cream tastes Peachy Keen though, so allow yourself some time on a nice Summer day to eat some Chronic Ice Cream with some Peaches and Cream Marijuana.”"
Lordofthecannadepths,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/peaches-and-cream/reviews/1655921,"“This strain is as great as it’s been hyped up to be, in my opinion.

Peaches and cream is the perfect name for it too, because you just feel so... peaches and cream. My best f...”"
