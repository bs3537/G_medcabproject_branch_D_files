But for real, hardcore is a very sedating ,yet relaxed high with the quality of being baked for some time . Almost as if when you smoke this , you are the edible getting baked ;)”"
bubbaShahab,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hardcore-og/reviews/1385284,"“Hardcore Og from West Coast Cure is some of the terpiest, tastiest, most sedating form of THC I've come across. These guys's work is INCREDIBLE and absolutely worth it. 5/5 Strain, and 5/5 concentrate EVERY batch.”"
brian318,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hardcore-og/reviews/1298291,"“Not as hardcore (pun intended) as I thought/was told it was gonna be. It takes a few minutes to set in, and then relaxation and euphoria takes ahold. Recommended for night use due to sleepiness after about an hour.”"
OneshotOutlaw,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hardcore-og/reviews/1481235,"“The description of this strain NAILS it. Ive been searching far and wide for something to break through the redundancy. Even have been considering a tolerance break since nothing was getting me to the headspace I was seeking. Hardcore lived up to its name and made me and 4 friends so damn giggly and full of freakin glee lol. Such a fun ride.”"

iamkeysersose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hardcore-og/reviews/1378331,"“I'm all about the flavor and scent profiles in strains. This one is pretty cool because it has a nice flavor profile, with some earthy grape notes in there. As far as anxiety and pain goes, I'm super spaced out and I feel like Gumby. Keep this for the "I just want to have fun and feel good" times. Highly recommended.”"

Cannacruz always has it around as a preroll (although I have yet to see the flower on its own anywhere) and it's one of my main go-tos. Blueberry is tied for my favorite strain and its sweet flavor and full body relaxation match well with Big Bud's heaviness to make a knockout strain with musky berry flavors and powerful sedation.”"

It really helps with depression, and allows my mind to clear up a bit and allow myself to get in a better state of mind.

However, I recently picked up 7g and I have to be honest, I noticed the headache significantly more. Besides that the high from it is pretty good and it does the job. Definitely not one of my favorites but then again I usually like Sativa better so I can't judge to harshly. I'll give it a 4 out of 5.

Someone recommend me hardcore og from a dispensary, from one hit I was high as a kite!
