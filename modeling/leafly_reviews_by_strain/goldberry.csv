The first time I tried Goldberry I was a bit disappointed thinking "Why do others like this, I feel very little." Then after a little bit I realized that I was very happy, I could still think clearly and focus. I decided to purchase Goldberry again and I discovered  there is not a very strong ...”"

I smoked a little bit of this weed in the morning before work and i was focused as well as in a good mood until about mid afternoon and then i just had to take smoke a little bit more to finish off my day!! This is definitely my choice for a productive day!!!”"

I have a spice rack of different strains and Goldberry is one that you will always find in my stash.  Living a hectic schedule means that I cannot get to stoned while I have a lot of work to do. Goldberry is a strain that I can smoke and feel stoned and focused instead of stoned and zoned. If you also live a busy life style, but still want to get high, you can find Goldberry at ...”"

The high is swift and uplifting, while coming down is very calm without any side effects to my knowledge. This is by far one of the best strains i've had that does wonders with keeping my stress to a minimum. The only negative effect I had was the taste. While it has a nice effect, the burn is very strong and can almost be ...”"

This is my favorite strain for wake and bake and in the morning because it's really not that strong, but is still good for medicating because it's much more subtle then some other strains.”"

KDNJimenez,https://www.leafly.com/indica/goldberry/reviews/1552289,"“Very light high! I felt great happy euphoric and slightly energetic/talkative high without the heavy weight eyelids from the indica. Which is strange... since this IS an indica and I generally prefer the Sativa effects. This allows me to focus and continue through the day. Although I haven’t done it, I feel as if I can smoke this and go into work and get shit done!”"
