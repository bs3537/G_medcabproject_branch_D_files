MrDandyland,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kushberry/reviews/1356011,"“Nice stony buzz, smoked it after a hard day at work and could barely lift myself from the couch or open my eyes. Mild sedative effect. My girlfriend who has serious trouble going to sleep uses this and falls asleep within minutes after the initial buzz. Great flavor and nice looking bud too.

Tortex,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kushberry/reviews/1063427,"“Beautiful strain. OG is still my favorite, but kushberry comes in second. It's got a musky fruity smell that's thoroughly intoxicating. That flavor is just about the same, fruity and skunky with lots of kush. Good smoke for morning and night time - I never feel burnt out on kushberry, but it definitely helps me get to sleep.

Overall, this stuff is great medicine. I know I'll be going back for more in the near futu...”"

This helped with inflammation quite a bit, helped with mild muscle pain and mild - moderate nerve pain.  Didn't get dry mouth at all, light smoke, got a little talkative, but no munchies.

I experience less fatigue smoking the kushberry concentrate oil than with other indica strains. Oh, and it makes me happy, and uplifted. This is really good for treating depression.”"

Smooth taste with an equally smooth high. Filled a small bowl and when I was finished, this strain wrapped me up like a warm blanket. Super relaxing body stone and a gentle, mellow head high. One of my new favorites !”"
jatb1975,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kushberry/reviews/1528287,"“I got a free gram from Urban Greenhouse in Phoenix. 

I smoked a decent sized bowl out of a water bong. Whenever I try a new strain, I only smoke one bowl. Then I wait a few mins to see what happens. I figure if it doesn’t make me feel anything after an entire bowl, it probably isn’t the strain for me. Anyway, it smoked really nice and smooth. Taste was decent. After about 5 minutes, a really nice euphoria crept up. ...”"
coryyj,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kushberry/reviews/1375571,"“This is for the a Berry Kush strain from Mad Mark farms up here in Washington state. This is my favorite strain. Really good high of just being happy and a very nice body high. Really helps for relaxing but no out of it at the same time. Highly recommended.”"
Hookakat1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kushberry/reviews/1278785,"“A very nice, very classic Indica. Very relaxing both mentally and physically. Careful getting too comfortable after use, getting up could be a bit difficult. It won't suck the energy out of you if you're already doing something though. Not bad for walking the dog, going to the store, etc. though.”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kushberry/reviews/1162671,"“A very mellow and happy high. It is quite relaxing and eventually will help you to have very sound sleep. The mellowing effects seem to last long after the high has worn off.

Great for anxiety and just plain relaxing.”"

Very enjoyable smoke and will look for it again.”"
jamx113,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kushberry/reviews/1392344,"“I like the early buzz..its light and keeps you focused..theirs dense bud structure and fine red hairs.  I also love the smell and taste of the smoke.  This is the main difference canreally be seen in the taste from other mush strains.  Its defiantely a must try..if only just to know its a great kush favorite you might like.  If you like evil berry/black berry/ or just a og kush this strain is a must for you!”"
