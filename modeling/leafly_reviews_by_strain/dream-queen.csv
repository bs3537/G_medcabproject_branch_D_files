This helped immensely with depression, stress, and replaced that nonsense with a clear, focused, happy high. I enjoyed music a lot more, I wanted to spend more time hugging my pets.

Functional, uplifting with the right amount of goofyness thrown in. Really puts a positive spin on your day, helps the hunger and you will be able to sleep at night. Best of all worlds. Blue Dream, Sour D & Skywalker sometimes go this route, but this is a very reliable strain (when grown proper). One of my top 3 of all time.”"

MisterPotatoman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-queen/reviews/1530309,"“Picked up a couple of ounces of Dream Queen this week. The cut tested at 29.8% THC making it powerful in and of itself.  I've been smoking this strain in the afternoons or when I'm not working. The sativa dominant effects are brought out if you smoke a joint or a couple nugs through water.  Much more than that, it's weed nap time!  :P”"
HighAF702,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-queen/reviews/1501618,"“This strain surprised me. At first I wasn't sure I was going to like it do to the strong smell, but once you get past that (ie. work with small quantities), it performs admirably and no weird taste either.

I find this a very heady high leaving me in a (day)dreamlike state...see what I did there. I did not feel overly confused though so could recommend for daytime use in clear conscience...see what I did there again?...”"
