euphoricvoyage,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacks-cleaner/reviews/1386943,"“For a person who normally enjoys indica's, this is one of my favorite hybrids I have tried so far. Seems heavier on the sativa, which for some reason I don't mind with this strain. Very strong pine sol odor and taste. Sticky and bright yellow/green. I can feel the high come on in about two-three hits, which is pretty good for me because I am an all day, high tolerance smoker. I just can't get over the smell and taste...”"

Warning: not for beginners.

Potency: 9/10 

Effect: very awake and clear. Great strain for anxiety if done moderation and heavy euphoria if you decide to go big. 

Flavor and appearance: lemony scent with sweet skunky undertones that becomes even stronger upon grinding . Crystals covering semi dense,cone-ish shaped buds. Lots of Kief in the trap. 


Will Defs buy again and wou...”"

You can medicate morning or night. In the morning it gives you some energy & focus. I'm the evening it's perfect for dabbing & zoning out watching cartoons. Doesn't cause me anxiety.
I wish I would've picked up a full gram of this shatter instead of just a half gram by MUV 78%THC”"

Last night I realized all I had in my medicine box were Sativa's and I needed something to help me sleep. Jack's Cleaner with it's lovely lemon aroma will keep you focused, energized, and uplifted during the day.  At night it provides me with a calming buzz it takes a little while but an hour after medicating the eyelids start getting heavy and it becomes hard to fight off the sandman.

Great cannabis for the morning. Lots of energy and focus, little goes a long way with this one.”"

I smoke every day and there was one day where I smoked 2 bowls and was high the entire day off of this. you definitely get your money's worth with this one. It does make you energetic, but for me, only if i take 1-2 hits. after that, i get waaaaay too high and i get really tired and pass out. so it's a good day time weed i...”"

ghostedandlost,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacks-cleaner/reviews/1623084,"“Loses a star initially because of the taste. Tastes like wet grass when vaping.

Very social high! We talked for a long time while smoking and got a pretty heavy high, but could still keep track of the discussions.

Mild munchies cravings. Probably not to good before a bigger meal.

The day after high is where the grade loses another star. I'm feeling fine, but I usally feel great. A bit harder to get work done...”"
Indicant,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacks-cleaner/reviews/1559564,"“Vaped this strain. Had a very sweet smell to it and tasted WONDERFUL. Only drawback was that the ABV material was a little less potent than other strain's I've vaped but I'll also note that I vape at higher temps so that might've caused it. 

A few good draws and I'm ready to tackle the day and get some stuff done. Not really recommended before bed due to the focus it gives you”"
nerveana,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jacks-cleaner/reviews/1560171,"“I found this strain to be true to its name, It makes me get busy. Pretty potent, sorta weird tasting, good pain relief and energy. A decent sour diesel alternative if they’re out. Flower I vaped was from Purple Star.”"
