It took it's time hitting, but when it hit, I was done.  Major high for me - my mind was a little absent, all I could do was giggle and smile... maybe nod here and there.  Almost felt like I was in a lucid dream - aware of what was happening... but then not feeling like I'm in my body.  Helped with muscle pain, felt like cool gel on my back m...”"

But honestly, Cabbage Patch smells beyond amazing. Straight up, I every time I get a whiff I legit say "oh my god" out loud to myself. Smells THAT good (again... to me).

It is a nice overall high. It does have a supper giggly side effect. I couldn't stop laughing for a good long time. It releases muscle pain and is fairly fruity and earthy to taste.”"

I've started the past two days with a couple bong rips and cruised throughout the morning. I was energetic, outgoing, and focused. This was while maintaining my focus and serenity!”"
Californiakid1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cabbage-patch/reviews/1221994,"“This strain is a spot on hybrid for me. I've been smoking for 7 years and it consistantly takes care of my pain while still giving me that great boost from its Durban poison heritage. Dont be supprised when you see it sold at the clubs topshelf price for its sweet and earthy flavors are worth the value.”"
Mongo80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cabbage-patch/reviews/1584794,"“Nice clever onset that speaks to those that like a nice little energy boost in your smoke. It sometimes makes me feel this racey hyperactivity in my body and mind and can leave you feeling the need to be actively doing something. Im also really enjoying this strain for its effectiveness on reducing the nerve pain I usually have on a daily basis to tolerable levels that allow me to properly establish reasonable comfor...”"
