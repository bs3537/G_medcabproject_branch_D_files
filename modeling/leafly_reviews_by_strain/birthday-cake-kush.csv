beammeup,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1392865,"‚ÄúLet them puff Cake!!! 
The flavor is very sweet, with fruity tones. It's got some zing for a Indica dominant strain. I mostly smoke Indica dominant strains, and from time to time I come across one that really stands out and this is one of those strains.

I dare you to try and go to work, or play video games on this stuff. It's intoxicating and difficult to stop smoking due to the stickiness and wonderful flavor profile.

lawofsin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1519672,"‚ÄúI love the effects of this strain. It wiped away my anxiety and depression and relaxed my body. The effects on the mind were pronounced but more indica like. I felt great but clear headed and functional even at high consumption levels. The taste is very reminiscent of GSC. But with a little more fruity of a flavor. Great if you have trouble sleeping or calming the mind. I‚Äôd buy again and again.‚Äù"

Dubster202,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1385420,"‚ÄúI enjoyed it. Took about 15 minutes to start feeling it but helps with headaches and keep you focused.

BubNola,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1414158,"‚ÄúBy far one of my favorites! I particularly liked It from the company Polaris out of Vegas. It has numbers that range from 22-26%, and usually has a smaller terpene profile. I don't mind. That simple equation makes for a happy high, helps with inflammation, anxiety, depression, you will want to eat sweets, it is pretty ok for pain, better for pain in the gut regions.

Cons: Got hungry a long while after not smoking, cotton mouth(which I was too high to notice until a friend pointed it out to me), and a fair bit of anxiety‚Äù"
emoteriyaki,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1417562,"‚ÄúVery solid indica dominant.
Has a clear headed body high that ebbs and flows through in ways that make pain go away, stress evaporate, and offers a nice little buzz throughout. My only negative is that it's not as level headed as GSC and the or offers clarity like Cherry Pie, it's all a bit muddled, the illusion of energy without the wherewithal to actually accomplish anything.

DeanThomas,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1646634,"‚ÄúThe batch of Birthday Cake I got was very sticky and sappy. Beautiful multi-colored flowers with greens, purples, and a white shimmer of trichomes. The taste is a little harsh but still pleasant. The aroma has a nice earthy, pungent smell with a touch of vanilla and/or honey. The high is a bit on the indica side, can definitely couch-lock you if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. Also is a decent appetite stimulator.‚Äù"

It gives me a very nice relaxing high to deal with my anxiety, but not enough to sleep.‚Äù"
deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1417558,"‚ÄúüéÇüí© Birthday Cake from Polaris is a beautiful looking indica-dominant hybrid but it seems to fall short in it's effects. It didn't really get me anywhere special. I felt relaxed and that was it. I still longed for that cerebral buzz or euphoric body high and neither of those were found here. The flavor to me was similar to that of Headband or a very piney strain. You could only taste a very subtle sweetness on the e...‚Äù"
Saginawstoner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1762017,"‚ÄúGood strain surely for a beginner smoker. Relaxing taste and gives you a good buzz of that perky ness. Hours later its a chill kinda time where you just don‚Äôt give any WHAT!!! OK!.  Begginers should give a little taste and see how you react to it. This hybrid has the best of both worlds but unfortunately its a limited time on the perky perk me up motivation buzz.‚Äù"

loobs07,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1373461,"‚Äúone of the better tasting strains ive ever had the pleasure of.  beautiful keefy small green buds, small red hairs. uplifting high.‚Äù"
Stoysus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1271669,"‚Äú4.2 out of 5 but that's because it's not a huge couch kicker. Thank you tribute in the d smelled and tasted like cotton candy. I couldn't stop vaping this one. Great daytime smoke. Rate this "loud"‚Äù"
951stilltripping,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1297991,"‚ÄúAwsome looking buds, frosty light green is the best!
Sweet and woody smooth hit, taste exactly like pre 98 bubba but much sweeter. Just the right blend of sativa/indica not too body-heavy or roof-top head high. Perfect for a chilly afternoon, one of my fav strains to roll instead of bong. Stay faded people!‚Äù"
bigbuddhaboy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1193215,"‚ÄúYum! Sticky green buds emit a pungent kush bouquet. The taste is sweet with hints of lemon and chocolate. Very relaxed, uplifting effects with moderate pain relief. Lovely strain!‚Äù"
