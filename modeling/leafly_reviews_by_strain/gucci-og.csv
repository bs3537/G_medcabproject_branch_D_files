BaronOfBud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gucci-og/reviews/1393571,"“Bred as a knockout high, Gucci was created to be smack-you-in-the-face strong. It is an award-winning strain, winning the 2013 Cannabis Cup for Concentrates. Gucci has a pungent, yet sweet flavor with a spicy aftertaste that is simply delicious: it is a very versatile strain. Great for social settings and acts like a sativa as it leaves you happy, tingly and energetic. When used at night it can allow you to relax eno...”"
sidewalkstonergirl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gucci-og/reviews/1517357,"“Took some Googling to find out this strain is also known as Facewreck. And it does exactly that, in the best way possible. Vaped great; after one pack I was blitzed and the best version of myself with an idgaf attitude about it. Introspective yet extraverted, this strain will lift you whil keeping you mellow. Recommend.”"

For how strong the speediness is, it’s relegated to the background / deep inside, which keeps it manageable. Mostly feel delirious. Clear eyed and energized like Jack Herer, but head is slightly dizzy - like on cold medicine. You’re there...but definitely stoned out. Feels tuned for socializing. Music is rich and unique sounding, but a considerable amount (40-60%) feels supp...”"

John18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gucci-og/reviews/1393559,"“Hello dear people.  I just smoked a half a joint of Gucci Og, and I am quite high.  I feel elevated, with a Sativa-like pressure behind my eyes, and a suddenly carefree feeling about the phone call I must make in a half an hour.  A tough call, that now has been made easier through contemplation brought on from the inhalation of this fine flower.  I will go easy on the man I must chastise.
Nice taste; a little spicy o...”"

I loaded a bowl in my bong  before work and was in a very good mood for most of the day. Which again does not come naturally to me especially at work.  I highly recommend for anyone that suffers from social anxiety or depression. On a side note I member the smell and taste to be very pleasant.”"

ahrenberger25,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gucci-og/reviews/1267402,"“Awesome variant to the good ol' OG Kush! Varying effects with different doses... It's much like smoking a top shelf sativa for the first few hits, then that Kushy Indica kicks in. Very tasty smoke. Extravagant and lavish body and head high.”"
joshchavo88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gucci-og/reviews/1376468,"“This stuff is STRONG. I did one bowl of this and it put me out. Granted I did a larger dose on purpose because I wanted to go to sleep, but damn I wasn't expecting for it to hit me that strong and that fast. This strain is really really good, will definitely be going back to it. Only reason I'm giving it 4/5 is because it gave me really bad cottonmouth, other than that it's the perfect strain.”"
