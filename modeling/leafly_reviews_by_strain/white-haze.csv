White Haze
=============
TheMueller,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-haze/reviews/1390846,"“White Haze is a pretty light smoke. The taste is kinda pine and earthy, with a nice addition of lemon flavor. something I prefer a lot.

At first comes a nice and warm body-buzz, followed by an euphoric head-high. The mind stays also focused and feels more awake.


The chilled body-buzz together with the focused and happy head-high make it a good Netflix or Chill After Workout - Strain.
Overall the effects of White H...”"

The nugs appeared dense with an ice like crystal coating, similar to that of frozen lawn dew. When ignited, I got a taste, sort of like an earthy taste but could taste more of something which reminded me of stone.  It was also quite smooth to say it was a sativa.  Unfortunately can't give a verdict of the after effects as I smoked another strain a...”"

captainsparkles,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-haze/reviews/1256718,"“Delicious fresh pine and lemon taste, like the best of PineSol and Mr. Clean rolled up into one.

Buzz is light and update. Very sativa-like. Like others have said, it is not overwhelmingly powerful, but I actually kind of like that. A nice, clean daytime-friendly buzz that goes well with pretty much any activity. Personally, I found the burnout to be a bit much, but this seems to be common with me and sativas.”"

yousaidyouwerelost,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-haze/reviews/1166631,"“This is a bad-ass strain that is perfect work lighting up on the way to work! Incredibly focused, and clear. I have on many occasions lit up, and helped customers with ease, and focus, and a sense of happiness. Perfect daytime medication, and perfect for depression.”"

Duffy_,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-haze/reviews/1381790,"“Good but not as good as say Green Cracker Jack.
Then again i do prefer Indicas anyway.
Still a good strain, just not as good as for the $18.00 a gram price tag.”"
ZecaBaleiro,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-haze/reviews/1680702,"“One of my favorite sativas too. Tastes super well giving you a great feeling while smoking. On the other hand, it is not as strong as a imagined.”"
Indicaem,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-haze/reviews/1279793,"“As a lover of anything haze crossed, I was excited to try this white haze. This bud has a lemon yet piney flavour and gives off a light buzz that relaxed my whole body, melting away my stiffness and muscle spasms.   I loved the body and mind high that comes with this strain, but did find the come down rather difficult 2 hours after smoking it.   Not a morning strain for me, but great for daytime use if you dont have ...”"

Diablo13580,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-haze/reviews/1287172,"“I personally am not a fan of this strain. It's just not enough bang for the buck you put in. At $20 a gram it's definitely not worth it. It's a mediocre head buzz for such an expensive Sativa. The high is pretty weak, and the you're back to earth in a quick hour or two. I don't recommend it unless you got some cash to spend. It helped my focusing issues of my ADHD, but wore off too quickly. It made me sleepy, which I...”"
