Garedicus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wsu/reviews/1315059,"“Picked up a couple pre-rolls of this from WoW Tacoma last week and decided to finish one of them off before the Cougar game today. Smoked the bottom 1/3rd of the joint through the a bong for a little filtering and quickly got to about a 7. It's relaxing as all hell and I can still understand the game of football - perfect for a rainy Tacoma day.”"
DoreenR,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wsu/reviews/1269365,"“Great before bed! I picked up the concentrate which clocked in at almost 85% THC and around 1% CBD. Tasted strongly of berries and pine. Great for relaxation, pain relief, and sleep!”"
kevinthedude,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wsu/reviews/1313057,"“I got my lungs on some WSU Crumble produced by Altered State. THCA 89.4% CBD 0.6%. 
Super earthy, piney taste and aroma. Clear but strong head high with an extremely relaxing body high. Beware of the munchies. Recommend this strain of concentrate, can't speak for the flower form of WSU.”"

Brad46and2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wsu/reviews/1321630,"“This is pretty much what a good indica should be in my opinion. It's great for at night when you just wanna chill, watch tv, and eat something before you fall asleep. This is one of the most relaxing strains I've tried and I'll definitely make this one of my regulars.”"
