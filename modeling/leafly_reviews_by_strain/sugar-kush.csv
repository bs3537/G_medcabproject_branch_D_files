Sugar Kush
=============
fukentrble,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1393712,"“This is by far in the top 5 of the best strain that I have ever had. It took care of my pain caused from crohns disease. Watch out she will sneak up on you, I finished one bowl and thought this is bunk weed so I started to pack another bowl and by the time I reached for the flower container she kicked in and I forgot what the hell I was doing. Gave me a great appetite the medicated feeling lasts between 2-3 hours dep...”"
The.Avid.Dabber,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1345278,"“Sweet sugary nuggets of dense buds. Little to no leaf and lots of crystalline trichomes. Smoke is smooth and flavorful. Immediate, relaxing indica effects felt right behind the eyes and extending all the way to my feet.”"
KitsuneNaturalWellness,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1385030,"“I have truly found the sugar kush to be an all around good strain; it's nice light flavor and aroma had me wanting to smoke more

Smell: Nice and light with notes of sweet and earthiness.  On top of that, there are some hints toward either pungent or floral.

Look:  The bud is a varying shade of green depending on the location on the bud.  Hairs are orange and seem to stand out less; that being said, it it still fuzz...”"

Thank You so much San Jose's, Medi+Marts!!!”"
Asexypistachio,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1345282,"“That is a really good strain in my opinion! It has a light taste in the mouth and isn't a heavy smoke. Really good for that evening hit! It gave me hilarious laughs with my girl followed by a chill and mellow mood, puting us to sleep. One of my favorites! Defenitely do recommend!”"
HotelCoralEssex,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1345280,"“This is a very solid indica. It's a very mellow high and pretty much all body and no head high. The effects come in pretty slow when smoked, and stay at a pretty moderate level. Definitely good for a relaxing night in without making you fall asleep right away. The strain isn't the strongest, but it definitely gets the job done without being too strong. Good for smoking all night.”"
redraspus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1158415,"“Great strain I've been getting from a long-time grower... this stuff is fabulous! Nice, full body high, but not too sleepy... fabulous sweet taste as well!”"

However this strain have louds of potency.
High was great no matter how much u smoke,

I love the strains that make you have those feelings you remember from your first rodeo.
high five.”"
Swiftylad,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1345299,"“The taste is so clean and pure! The smell is amazing too it's got the heavy kush strain smell to it. I have days where I feel kind of depressed about things, and this strain really helps curb my depression”"

TickleTrunks,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1411824,"“Received this in a sample pack from my dispensary and it was a very standard, typical indica kush. The effects were good, and taste was mellow, but mellow is pretty much the way to describe Sugar Kush. I would buy again if it was on discount, but there is stronger out there.”"

monstermaya,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1345296,"“Smooth inhale, sweet easy exhale. Sugary scent - with something with "sugar" in the title you can't expect it not to! Dense and fairly frosty with light orange hairs. Keeps you mellow, nice to listen to some music and chill to. It isn't seemingly powerful enough to put me to sleep, but still relaxing nonetheless.”"
snuggledakitty,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1282904,"“This has a nice flavour and is plenty potent. I found it gave me the munchies which seems contrary to the description here on Leafly.”"
ohHeyy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1396932,"“Not impressed. expected it to me a lot sweeter smelling or something given the name. Effects are bit great, armoma not special. Gets the job done but I will go for something else personally”"
MsMoneymaker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1275882,"“Great strain for edibles”"
wittlewauren,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1367828,"“Appearance- very beautiful, large nugs. Seems to be a very light green color with larger dark green leaves and orange furs. Seems like it would be dense when you look at it, however when you break in open you will notice that it's quite fluffy making for a beautiful grind.

Smell- very fruity. Like fruit loops or rainbow pebbles!

Smoke- tastes almost like a mocha, interestingly enough. Hit very smooth.

Feeling- eve...”"

LaGoong,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1277317,"“Has a bit of creep to it, but a wonderful, powerful, TASTY indica, perfect for that nighttime fade out. Dense, floral buds that break up and smoke well. Much preferable to Blackberry kush in my eyes.”"

CannabisCornerTV,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1248714,"“Pleasant earthy aroma.  Sweet, what you would expect from something called Sugar Kush.  Kicks in fairly quickly, not too much of a creeper.  When pressed into rosen, it shows potential.  The hashplant genetics really come through.  A great strain.”"
meowmix88,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1524686,"“As someone who is extremely thc sensitive and tends to get anxiety, this strain doesn’t do that. No anxiety at all. 

The initial rush starts with a warmth in the chest following a curiosity for my surroundings, lots of talking and relaxation. After an hour or two I’m feeling pretty sleepy, until I smoke more then I feel like talking about ideas again. 

Love it!”"

I’ve never had a ‘bad high’ before and wasn’t sure those existed until I smoked this. I am regularly not paranoid however, this strain made me very paranoid and actually brought me to tears because of it. I kept hearing things that weren’t there, my poor boyfriend had to deal with my tears every half and hour or so. I think it’s a good s...”"
Vapman97,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1621780,"“Very nice daily strain, effects start off with euphoria and relaxation and gradually turn into aroused and sleepy. Nice taste with a buttery soft lavender grape lemon pine flavour that turns into sweet sour candy as you vape. Excellent!”"
badangel00013,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1463061,"“Bedtime!  That's the best way I can describe this strain.
It smells of the typical kush smell with well frosted buds and a nice smoke. Low on terpenes but still there.  
I find after smoke I am relaxed but it really does make my head feel thick and heavy. I can still think well,but as soon as I close my eyes it's like someone closed the shutters and blinds on my brain and I'm drifting off quickly to dreamland.”"

seasyl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sugar-kush/reviews/1438371,"“very relaxing numbing high you'll feel through your extremities. Smoked it through a glass blunt with gummy bears mixed 1:1. Bit of trouble walking so not a functioning high but definitely a chill out high”"

Don't have the kush smell or taste. Smelled of sweet butter. Taste of sweet tar. Didn't enjoy the taste. After packing a popper didn't feel much. So broke it down and put it in a raw paper cone.
