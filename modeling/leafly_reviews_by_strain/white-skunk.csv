ryndembot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-skunk/reviews/1418674,"“found some white skunk with 2.7 cbd and 20 thcc its a high ceiling and a cerebral at first. didnt notice any sleepiness even at high doses which is nice.. the smell isnt super strong but complex with orange citrus/pine/skunk odor. when I first opened the jar it was reallllyyy nice smelling like earthy skunk berry. its a pretty heavy effect but only after you moke alot, which I reccomend”"
MagicMonkey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/white-skunk/reviews/1213224,"“I'd give this strain a solid 4 stars. Try this indica-dominant first thing on a lazy Saturday morning; I guarantee you won't be disappointed. More cerebral than you would expect. I found it to be a nice balance. Don’t forget to turn up the tunes with this one.”"

The first was a small super-solid-silver christmas tree looking thing that I think may have been a White Ice? Twas very potent, unique skunky smell and taste, strong stone. Finished very early 6-7 weeks. 
Clones kept getting increasingly better. Second pheno was hermie and lacked the same quality as the first, average. The lucky last White Skunk seed turned out to be WHIT...”"
