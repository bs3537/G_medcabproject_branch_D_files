Death Star OG
=============
Davems,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deathstar-og/reviews/1416154,"“While I have yet to review any particular strain until now, This particular flower prompted me to do so, as it is now my favorite of all I have tried.  I am partial to indicas, and this certainly fills the bill.  Enjoyable but strong, I used a vaporizer, which eliminated any possible harshness.  It comes on strong and stays with me well ast 2 hours, and the only problem I have is that it has been difficult to obtain....”"
phumbling,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deathstar-og/reviews/1414167,"“Yes. A couple pulls from the vape pen and all the edges smooth away - no neck and shoulder pain, no chatter box brain reviewing my entire day. Half hour later - I'm yawning, eye lids relaxing, and typing this review - sleep awaits. Will smoke this in place of prescribed pharmaceuticals. Thank 'god' I was finally able to purchase what I need and not just what a 'guy who knows a guy' can get.”"
Shabadoo420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deathstar-og/reviews/1411068,"“Best Indica ever. super heady and relaxing. Huge nugs of stinky goodness. Great for me at night for stress and insomnia.”"

TaylerKaitlynnLove,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deathstar-og/reviews/1414170,"“After buying a new piece with my boyfriend I went immediately to the dispensary to grab some Death Star OG. It was a fun night of chilling in my car, toking, listening to music and reminiscing. Definatley a euphoric, talkative, giggly, happy high. Did make me feel lazy, but that's expected since it is an Indica. Pretty strong. Was faded within 30 seconds but It was chill. No anxiety, barely any paranoia. I'd say its ...”"
captaingnargnar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deathstar-og/reviews/1383156,"“Just got my free gram of this particular strain, it was some private reserve and the potency can be seen and smelled from quite a distance, the buds have a golden like quality to them with yelowish trichomes throughout giving a very sour but lemony sweet after tone much like an og kush. This high is very sedative and will sit you right down i was fully relaxed and felt it through out my whole body with very little bu...”"

TheGreenGuysDelivery,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deathstar-og/reviews/1351533,"“Genetics: 
Sensi Star x Sour Diesel

Notes: 
Death Star strain is a well balanced Sativa and Indica hybrid. The flavor of Death Star smoke is delicious and leaves you with that definitive diesel aftertaste and has a body numbing effect to it, which comes from the indica side.”"
MrUnicorn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deathstar-og/reviews/1380512,"“STRONG! It hits hard and keeps on coming. As heavy as this indica is, I still had a clear enough head to function on a basic level. 30 minutes in my body felt like it was getting a massage. Super relaxing, no paranoia. This strain is amazing for people with insomnia. Put me to sleep with the greatest of ease and let me sleep solid through the night. This is the first indica that has REALLY knocked me out.”"

Worked very well for my depression, anxiety, pain & insomnia. If you see this strain definitely give it a try as it is some truly potent bud.”"
oneandone,https://www.leafly.com/indica/deathstar-og/reviews/1410493,"“So after fighting it as long as possible I decided to join the concentrate version of cannabis. I picked up a buttonless Vapen battery which,by the way works great, and a cartridge of The Clear's Deathstar OG. Honestly I couldn't be happier with either purchase. The oil tastes great and could not be more smooth. The Deathstar OG high is excellent. Nice psychedelic head high combined with a very strong body buzz that ...”"

Extremely relaxing, good for pain relief. It's definitely not a strain to use if you have anything to do. This is one of those 'if you need me I'll be melting into my couch' strains. Highly recommended.”"
