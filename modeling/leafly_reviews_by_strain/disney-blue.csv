It's great for relaxing and getting your creative side going, if you smoke a little more. It's great for sleepy time if you smoke a couple bowls. It's uplifting and happy and my new favorite strain, which is why I stocked up on it, because it's not always available. If you get a chance to try Blue Disney, you won't be disappointed.”"

Disney Blue: 

The buds look light green and big, they smell like berries or grapes, and they’re super sticky to the touch. When smoked you get the berry taste and it’s an uplifting high, but you’re clear headed and could easily pass off being stoned if you’re at work or something. This could be a good one to melt stress and still stay productive. I would buy again mostly for the swe...”"

This bud is so dreamily dank that even vaping, the sweet blueberry odor is heavy and clear. This strain pulls beautifully and lends itself to a creative mind and an aching body. After my first day up at 5000 feet (I live at sea level), I was able to ignore altitude sickness with the help of this magical beauty and drum the night away. Really wonderful, creative, happy making s...”"

LowLevel0wl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/disney-blue/reviews/1307702,"“A strange strain, but good for it. It creeps with a buzz behind the mind and a gentle blanket on the body. Not super strong by any means, but a few solid doses do make you wish you were riding Pirates of the Caribbean or even Star Tours!”"

Peace, Hoes”"

It’s got all the best elements of being of a hybrid that allows you to enjoy life along with your high. Wonderful flavor, reminiscent of berry or fruit cotton candy. Definitely a fantastic mood lifter, highly recommended.”"

Had a major project to clean up after before the wife returned the next morning. I was so high I finished the garage and started a load of laundry and folded all the clothes. Damn! This earned its place in my artillery.”"
