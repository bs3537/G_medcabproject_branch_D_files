This was all that and then some :)  Very happy and relaxed.  Creative and thoughtful and filled with laughter.  It is perfect!”"
McMikefresh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunshine-4/reviews/1416984,"“Amazing strain, picked up an 1/8th from The Herbal Cure in Denver. Their Sunshine #4 is testing at 30.59% THC, so it's definitely a powerful strain. Plus anything that has Chem4 in it is gonna be amazing. Light green buds with a lot of light brown hairs and covered in crystals. Smells great, can't put my finger on it exactly, deff some citrusy hints. Overall very nice strain with a very nice high. Relaxing body high ...”"

mhillman0191,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunshine-4/reviews/1434144,"“This strain is fire. Reminds me of a gorilla glue or bubba strain. Danky. Burns pretty slow. The high is great. It puts me in a zone and I forgot that I had a joint in my hand after smoking half of it. Nugs were hard and crispy, but not dry so it broke up good.”"

DetroitGando,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunshine-4/reviews/1399099,"“This strain that you think won the cup is called #4 lol. 

That is just wrong. The person who entered it lied about the name to avoid the fact he was given a clone he wasn't supposed to have had. 

Sunshine #3 people and it is straight from Detroit. That is the real story. 

And believe me I can find it everyday in Detroit. 

Good Day my phriends.”"

Especially for those with back pain. at the same time, i enjoyed its pain relief feeling while doing small projects around the house. ( while watching the grand babies i should add ). Highly recommend if it's a Netflix kind of night.”"

BakedInMichigan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunshine-4/reviews/1393138,"“The first hit I took was like I was laying on the beach as the boats and jetskis zipped past in the distance. 

It also tastes kind of fuely but like boat fuel.”"
Faydid420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunshine-4/reviews/1518139,"“Amazing! Super dense, keef covered nuggets. Gave me a good body high, helping to chill my stressed ass out. Seemed to help mildly with my headache; but with the euphoria and relaxation, the headache was easier to ignore.”"
InfiniteDR3AMER,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunshine-4/reviews/1467576,"“All I can say about this one is.... HOLY.... FUCKING... SHITTTT. Most potent cannibas I've ever smoked in my life. Smells absolutely delicious, tastes great, has a nice chest burn. Completely fried kind of high. I was definitely able to get shit done but I felt extremely socially awkward with other people when I was at the grocery store but my brother said it was all in my head.... ha (really strong weed) the type I'...”"
medicalguy62,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunshine-4/reviews/1560466,"“My dispensary sold their stock of this strain as indica dominant. The hazy, relaxed head high comes on strongly at first but the body high will hit you later. Head-to-toe pain relief for me. The odor, lavender and earthy with cirtus under tones, with a taste not as strong but still refreshing. This strain has a great indica pain relief qualities but the head high left me in a mellow, positive, slightly psychedelic da...”"

GreenWoman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunshine-4/reviews/1698309,"“Another reviewer said "beach day in a bong" and that's the perfect way to describe it. This is a perfect morning strain on days you don't have to do anything.”"
Davidpnin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunshine-4/reviews/1780444,"“A daily smoker here and this is very strong and intense weed.  It's disorienting but in a good goofy way.  It honestly makes you stupid high and you'll mix and misuse words.  But overall it doesn't give me anxiety and it's pleasure - also very numbing.  BTW it's a creeper!  10-15 mins in and you'll be in a weed hurricane.”"
Randy3030,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sunshine-4/reviews/1687302,"“Bought for lower back pain relief and not only achieved that but what a trip down memory lane for a good head buzz. Was told that it was comparable to cannatonic#4 by bud tender (not in my case!). I’ll be going back to cannatonic #4 myself , but if you want the high with the relief this is a good pick.”"

I’ve been smoking for many years and this is one of those surprising new strains that hits you like the rays of the sun. Long-lasting head high, that keeps you focused and energized while still giving you a mild body buzz for relaxation. Perfect strain to toke up and clean the house, or toke up and play some Xbox. Will be smoking this one again! ☀️🔥”"
