LeroyBrown420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-trainwreck/reviews/1259028,"“I've been smoking this strain for about 2 weeks and very happy with my selection. These buds are sticky icky and flavorful. Sweet berries, citrus, pine and a diesely zip. Shes Indica dominate, stony but not foggy with quality Sativa traits. Best used latter in day or evening as shes a little narcotic.”"
Indicaem,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-trainwreck/reviews/1295906,"“This strain is a cross between blackberry and trainwreck and has an earthy berry flavour.  I enjoyed the flavour of this bud, but the high was way too focused for me. I became so focused I cleaned for hours on end, organizing and not able to sit still until all the tasks my mind was creating were complete. I wouldnt smoke this again.”"
Clevernamed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-trainwreck/reviews/1698012,"“I like the flavor. Its got strong flowery berry taste and I also get the strong diesel finish. For me the high is positive and heady with a good couch lock narcotic buzz to compliment.”"
PowerplantCo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-trainwreck/reviews/1257519,"“If I could rename this strain I would call it Grape Popsicle. It smells exactly like a f***ing grape popsicle. Great heavy indica effects. Smoke hits you hard but quickly eases into full body relaxation.”"
SecretSquirrel541,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-trainwreck/reviews/1528164,"“Very good strain for pain relief. I have yet to find anything better. My only gripe is that the pain relief only lasts for 2 to 3 hours, but while it is working I love it. I have a very bad case of sciatica. The burning needles and pins pain sensation makes my single encounter with shingles seem like a paper cut. Imagine taking a red hot knife, stabbing the outer thigh of each leg and slicing upward. Then imagine com...”"

orgncwhtmlk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-trainwreck/reviews/1235627,"“Some Blackberry Wreck crumble this time! This stuff has a seriously sweet taste.

It is a good full body and mind head rushing stony baked strain. lol YUM.”"
flipndip187,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-trainwreck/reviews/1347533,"“Blackberry Trainwreck was something i hadnt heard about at all. Got a couple Z and first thing i was underwhelmed by was the smell. You can tell it has blackberry genes from the smell, and the smell tells you its potent, it is just very bland. The nugs where bright green and orange, conic and very dense, and absolutley caked in trichs. so much so that u would get a pile of keef every time u grind it, and there would ...”"

dsbz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-trainwreck/reviews/1263880,"“Hands down the best strain I have smoked for anxiety and stress. I instantly felt a positive cloud over top of me. The high was clear and I was able to do other tasks”"

tgigrass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-trainwreck/reviews/1211422,"“Dark, dough-y consistency.  Bitter fore-taste, but pleasant aroma and aftertaste.  Overall high is decent, better than bad, but not premium.”"
