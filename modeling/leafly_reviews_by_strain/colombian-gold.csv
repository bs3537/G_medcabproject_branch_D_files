Jrullman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/colombian-gold/reviews/1165337,"“Very dense crystal covered light green buds with light hue in orange pistols giving it a really keifish covered look, the smell - very skunk, earthy, sweet/spice taste, highs are amazing for am wake ups - i found vaping a bowl in afternoon brought on slight anxiety, very hard to concentrate for 20 or so minutes. Its a very LOUD smelling strain, i really enjoyed it, would recommend especially in a.m!

Didn't know it was a sativa at the time cause back then (early 80's) not much about strains were known to the general public. I loved it cause it was among the best weed you could get.

You can  work three jobs, have 5 children and be up late night tired as a dog..... as soon as the CG gets into your body you well be lit! Great euphoric state and balance of energy and calmness. I love this strain and the taste is amazing sweet- notes and hints of lemon I feel like add more of the refreshing feeling that this stain had to offer.”"
koomiekoomy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/colombian-gold/reviews/1308487,"“This legendary strain delivers a super strong long lasting drunk-like, highly euphoric punch; and lasts a remarkable 1 day. The high decays very slowly over time. Share it and smoke it at your house with your friends. Play some Cumbia music off of Youtube and you'll feel like your smoking it in Colombia.  (Vap'd at 340 Fahrenheit)”"

 I paid $40 for a quarter that lasted a week.
I was a very heavy smoker then, I was 18 years old.
  As a grower, I can tell you, 
This was commercially produced Outdoor grown, organic weed grown in Colombian Sun..
 About 10 seeds per quarter (Not saved!?)
Bricked, but not smashed.

No weed I have smoked in the last 25 years even compares.
