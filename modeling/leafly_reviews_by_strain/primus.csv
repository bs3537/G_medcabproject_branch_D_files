Here is my experience with it, read if you're curious about the smoking of this fine strain. 
You feel happy immediately, the high takes a few moments to really kick in though. The high is amazing. My face is tingling and my entire body feels a strong pulsing and massaging feeling. ...”"
chrononaut,https://www.leafly.com/indica/primus/reviews/1417611,"“A true indica triple threat! This strain should be experienced by all! Or at least indica lovers!!The lineage is complex yet elegant as leafly states.

Heavy on all the indica markers-body,mind,mood,and oh the hunger!

Goes the distance 3-3(1/3) Hrs respectively, heavy finish, may cause napping haha.

Flavors-Pine,Skunk,Lemon Bars

Jrodgilbert,https://www.leafly.com/indica/primus/reviews/1417446,"“Best Strain in the Market of WA for sure! We have been to many shops, tried many farms, and as many strains as we can, all around WA and OR.  Primus OG is the best weed in the state hands down.  I believe our first experience was from Ocean Greens at a whopping 31%.  We couldn't pass, and I'm glad we didn't.  Check it out, especially if you are a fan of PRIMUS.  Cause this shit SUCKS bad!!”"
Primus420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/primus/reviews/1361569,"“After trying well over 50 different strains I have found Primus to be my favorite by a long shot!! I have had it from two different growers (Rainer Farms & Stillwater) and BOTH were top notch! It's a very happy, euphoric, relaxed, pain reliving, what anxiety?? Stay up and socialize or pass out type of high.. It's a very unique strain. (Every strain has different affects for different people, I prefer Indica dominate ...”"
DougNug,https://www.leafly.com/indica/primus/reviews/1417444,"“Correction to my last review. 
The phenotype of this strain grown by Sweetwater Farms is more like a hybrid, with a nice sativa leaning high and a relaxing indica comedown. Great stuff. one of my favorites.”"

I have been enjoying various strains for years trying to find the "perfect" strain for me and I finally  accomplished that. It's  Happy, euphoric,  creative, energetic BUT pass out on command..   Relieves pain anxiety, This strain is like no other! I have had this strain from two different growers-Rainier Farms and sweet...”"
Kristopholese,https://www.leafly.com/indica/primus/reviews/1382306,"“One of the stankest, rankest smelling strains you'll ever lay nostrils to - &I mean that as a compliment. EXTREME chemmy, earthy, skunk smells, blend together to create a very loud, lingering taste and smell. The  better this strain is grown, the more extreme this becomes. Has a somewhat racey, sour diesel-type sativa "feel", although indica effects are present as well.”"
qpjames,https://www.leafly.com/indica/primus/reviews/1444946,"“For me, this is a strain that is best smoked in a bong. It works very well when smoked in a joint/pipe, but daaaaayum, when I hit this from a bong, it's lights-out! The effects are the same, but it seems that, for me, getting that extra quantity, down deep, makes a big difference.

It is overall a single-phase high, it just does it's thing and keeps doing it. At lower doses, I can still think clearly and carry on dee...”"
deirdredenali,https://www.leafly.com/indica/primus/reviews/1342779,"“I'm new to being able to choose strains, after moving from Minnesota.

This is the strain I chose to take in the evening to relax and fall asleep. It's been great for that. I can feel my muscles letting go and it seems like it really clears my mind. I also can smoke a ton of it without getting spins, which is great.

The reason I'm giving three stars are because I find the dry-eye to be really severe and also my munc...”"

EnjoysAnyWeed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/primus/reviews/1347619,"“A killer strain from People's Choice Wellness Center.
Smell and taste is sweet and herbal. Reminds me of honey and cinnamon. Yum.
The high is wonderful I could only ask for it to be a bit stronger but that might ruin some of the uplifting effects. Puts me in a happy trance.”"
ChemicalGeorge,https://www.leafly.com/indica/primus/reviews/1627349,"“First off, let me just say that this strain STINKS like skunk mixed with diesel which made me nauseous that I wanted to pass out! That's when you know you have GOOD weed. Personally I am not a fan of this kind of smell, but that's my opinion. Flavor was pretty smooth with subtleties of sweetness yet that diesel taste too. Boy, did this strain hit me like a train. All I remember is going to bed and melting completely ...”"
Rushx1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/primus/reviews/1434121,"“Just tried the Primus for the first time and immediately felt reminiscent , it was the taste.

The buds are some of the hairyest I've seen. Tight fluffy bud structure so it retains its "stickiness" as long as it's not aggressively trimmed. 

Pretty easy to break down by hand and makes a great joint/blunt weed.”"
