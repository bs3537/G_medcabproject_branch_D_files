MellowSailor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/willys-wonder/reviews/1389771,"‚ÄúWilly's Wonder (aka William's Wonder) is an indica dominant hybrid that has that wonderful, dank aroma.  I'm an indica connoisseur and have tried many, so I approached Willy's Wonder with high expectations.  Sadly, I didn't find much spectacular about it.  It's really good, and the quality is excellent, but for me it was "just another indica hybrid" and nothing special (like Hindu Kush).  

It's excellent for night...‚Äù"
