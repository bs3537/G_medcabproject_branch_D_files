Not an immediate buzz, more of slow to start and then all of a sudden you are Giddy High ... listening to some old love songs and singing along loudly to all the words ... Well Oregon Pineapple You're THE INSPIRATION... you make me want to smile, relax, laugh and even get some chores done ... as long as the music is still playing and I can sing along ... loud proud and Stoned...”"

This batch was fluffy and smoked way too fast. About twice as fast as usual. Could smoke all of it and barely get an added effect. Not for me except maybe on a depressed day.

Very light flavor and smell. Lilac, grape.”"
PixiePDX,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1366671,"“I have a very low tolerance after not smoking for 2 years. Everything I have smoked sence starting to use again has made me tired and lazzy. I recently had a friend give me some pineapple and bam!!! I found what I've been looking for! After smoking my pain in my hips was gone and I was up cleaning my house and playing with the kids! I haven't felt that good sence before I decided to stop taking pain meds!!! 

I will ...”"

RizzleDizzle420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1254206,"“Literally tastes like pineapple. This bud is so sweet and the high is very euphoric. Absolutely a must try.”"
Hookakat1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1165634,"“Upbeat head buzz.  Relaxing body feel but not energy-draining.”"

rockandrollem,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1318898,"“I picked this up as a curiosity. I was pleasantly surprised by the mellow, sailing ⛵through my day buzz. Plus, no fallout at the end of the high. Grown hydroponically, with a very slight pineapple taste. More sweet tang and tropical. I would definitely get again.👍”"

martin.hensley.3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1132493,"“This strain was effective,  however it does not taste well it taste's like hay
The smell before tasting is marvelous.  That's why I chose it in the first place.  I would smoke it again but it is not my first choice.”"
Zack25,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1262510,"“This was an awesome strain. " It tastes as good as it smells" my bud tender told me and boy was she right. It had a very sweet overtone with a slight zing in the finish. All around smooth smoke, with a very well balanced high. The bodily effects were strong but mellow and I got no paranoia. It was a very good buy and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes there bud on the fruity side. Happy Smoking.”"

StonerReview,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1192733,"“Great look and taste. Mediocre smell. The hits didn't hit my chest like i like, and high was more of a buzz. I would love to hit you with how it made me feel this or that, but it just fell way short. Only reason I didn't give it 1 star is due to the looks and taste.”"
tcs2332,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1243976,"“I really liked this strain alot. It has that lovely skunky dank smell. I grind, and enjoy grinding the buds, easy to break off/avoid stemmage and grinds smooth for an easy pack.

The effects are dead on, I was a happy fool after I smoked a bowl. Usually Im pretty mellow and just gaming, but this thing def perked me up, made me feel absolutely great, and yeah I just have nothing but positive things to say about it! gr...”"
Slotracer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1298842,"“I'm reviewing the vape cartridge. I give it high marks for flavor; earthy and fruity. Also, for an excellent uplifting, happy high. It's a clear headed buzz, too. Not foggy or hazy. 
It comes on a little slow so it's a bit sneaky. One of my favs so far.”"

micjay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1162046,"“Had some shatter of this testing at 88% THC & 5.4% CBD. It's definitely more of a sativa and relieves any stress or anxiety and takes some pain away, especially with that amount of CBD. Every batch is somewhat different and I think I got lucky. Its great for daytime use and still be functional. Too much and it'll make you sleepy.

If you can find it, Great! try some. Especially the concentrate.”"

Enjoy the head rush from the Pineapple and relaxation from the Master Kush!”"
RockSteady,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1135872,"“This strain fairly good. Has an old school aesthetic, buds are on the fluffy side and smell of fresh berries. The effect is mild and pleasant. A Decent daytime smoke.”"
FrostyPharm,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/oregon-pineapple/reviews/1185733,"“Truly delicious! The smoke is sweet and light while delivering a wonderfully lung expanding sensation without much coughing. I was relaxed, euphoric, and very calm. definitely a strain I'll be on the lookout for in all forms, especially a clone.”"
