I haven't smoked in 10 years and a lot of strains now are just way heavy.  This left me feeling relaxed and focused.   I find this to be one of the top medicinal strains out there for me right now”"

MacaroniSenpai,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ogre-berry/reviews/1273890,"“One of my new favorites. With this strain's percentage at around 24ish one bowl is all you need if you don't want to be sleepy afterwards. If you do need that extra help sleeping then I recommend a second bowl for the indica effects to really hit you hard.

Dank Souls for life.”"

Not really, but you know what I mean.”"
