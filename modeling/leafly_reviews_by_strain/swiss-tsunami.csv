craakyerhead,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/swiss-tsunami/reviews/1413386,"“Tried this strain today, and I must say, I like it a lot. Very similar to the AC/DC strain, but with better flavor in my opinion. I use high CBD strains in combination with my RSO edibles to combat my severe back and body pains, as well as my PTSD. I've been in less pain, and had less episodes using this combo. It's really turned my life around.”"

idont,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/swiss-tsunami/reviews/1330333,"“CBD only. I got some that was 17% CBD. Can't feel anything different when sober other then (for me) no anxiety, no depression, no pain. It's a medicine. First weed that me and my partner went back to by more of because we were going through it until we found a reliable place to get tincture from hemp oil cbd.

If mixed into a THC strain can cause headache and dizziness. It changes the high you have with your daily a ...”"

mikeinsac,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/swiss-tsunami/reviews/1340585,"“I was looking for a high CBD Sativa and couldn't find ACDC, so I tried this one. Because it is so low in THC, there is virtually no head high at all. Though this does relax the body, it is also mild enough you can keep moving around. No couch lock. I slept better with this than without it. No psychoactive effects at all, which makes it nice for entertaining.”"
PineappleScott,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/swiss-tsunami/reviews/1578656,"“Prepare to be swept away. 

              The swiss have a reputation. A reputation for being neutral and peace loving. Who doesn't love the swiss ? This strain is the same way. It will put you at peace and without the adverse or debilitating effects you might usually associate with cannabis. 

         This strain smells like an orange! It is some of the best smelling flower there is for me.  The smoke tasted earthy...”"
sbuck11,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/swiss-tsunami/reviews/1380948,"“Swiss Tsunami is interestingly amazing. I used a strain w/ <1% THC and 9% CBD. I am and India hybrid type of person and I loved this strain.... It is definitely different. VERY little head high but the body high is there. I will admit, when I first ripped it out of a bong, it almost felt "bunk". However, after 10 min, it was life changing. 

It is a strain that is definitely specific to your mood. But if your local d...”"
Shadowforcenick,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/swiss-tsunami/reviews/1413499,"“So this was my first true CBD strain. A very important thing to know is that CBD strains are a little harsher due to the lower concentration of THC. I'm not sure why this is, but it's definitely noticeable. The flavor profile was meak, with the only real notes of flavor coming through as a sort of haze flavor. Now that I have let the effects set in, I am quite pleased. I love the body relief, and have been needing it...”"

Before you read the review, I must clarify that this was my first real CBD strain.

Aroma: Smells lightly of fresh orange peel. Not particularly pleasant. 0.75/1 Star.

Taste: I was hopeful for the taste based on the smell but I guess CBD strains really do struggle in this area. A burnt kind of taste or nothing and it wasn't the pen because I got a Select pen. Weed, which is disappoi...”"

I keep this on hand for the skull clawing bouts of ick I feel when I get way to far into my own head, or the pain has kept me from sleeping worth a damn. 
Works best in a flower vape. OMG kind of went into a panic when I felt the horrible pain and tig...”"
Jenspark,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/swiss-tsunami/reviews/1621959,"“This is everything I have been looking for in a strain. I wanted to be able to come home from work, veg on the couch and let the worries of the day melt away, without conking out. I vaped Swiss Tsunami from a Select cartridge. One 3-second hit and I was set for the night. (I have a very low THC tolerance, and am very sensitive to CBD, as well.) I had been panicking over work stuff, and within a few minutes I was more...”"

IIJay,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/swiss-tsunami/reviews/1595570,"“I’m surprised this isn’t more popular. I really liked it. Good medicinally and even recreationally - as long as you’re not looking for anything too crazy.”"
Torrancen90,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/swiss-tsunami/reviews/1675599,"“I suffer from intense paranoia when smoking. Swiss Tsunami, is the only strain I have found to where I can catch myself becoming paranoid, and can curve the direction of my thoughts to prevent a bad experience. Hands down my favorite strain.”"
