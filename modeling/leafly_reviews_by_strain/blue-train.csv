Blue Trainwreck

TheColdOne,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-train/reviews/1381118,"“This is a very sweet and floral bud. It provides a very smooth vape.  It hits you right upfront, making you feel like you have drunk 2 or 3 glasses of wine.  That effect transitions into a warmth that surges up from your core and out through your throat.  This body high is a warm and cozy feeling.  This strain provides for a beautiful relaxation effect making areas of muscle tension fade away. You will definitely exp...”"
PizzaChamp420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-train/reviews/1356704,"“Experience: A heavy high, slight tingling in the fingertips; inebriating, sedating, spacy, and slow. An opioid-like high, as if drinking a bottle of cough syrup, but without the paranoia. Relaxes the muscles in your face and body. Smoke it and become a soft, space-marshmallow…
Usage: Would recommend for nighttime. Best to unplug and go to bed. 
Look/Feel: She’s a rich dark purplish green, bushy and dense. The buds ar...”"

Three guesses as to what this sucker smells like.  It's a really pleasant blueberry and I swear I'm getting a little tobacco, like a cigar, as well.  But I've sampled a bit already, so keep that in mind.  :P

The buds were as expected, t'd up and very smelly, busting it up you get a bit of a sweet and spicey berry.

ThisOneTimeAtUmass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-train/reviews/1568940,"“Super chill mode is the best way to describe this. I did not get the energizing effects described by others at all, but I will try again at some point to confirm. I've tried several Blueberry crosses and this carries the least aroma and flavor, but more of the indica affects than expected. Needs more prominence of both parents to impress.”"
