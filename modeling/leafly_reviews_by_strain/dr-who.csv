michaelh360,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dr-who/reviews/1395927,"‚ÄúDr. Who is now my favorite. It's very tasty and is so fruity and tropical. The high is an Indica buzz but I get some hints of Sativa in there which uplifts me and energizes me. What's is cool is the same time tho I could get up and carry on with my day. My fellow stoners this strain is awesome.‚Äù"

A very rich velvet smoke with deep earthy notes and a hint of pine in the background.

Bubbles1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dr-who/reviews/1375914,"‚ÄúI purchased more of this before it sold out. It's my go to for daytime medicating, especially when mixed with Sweet Island Skunk or another Sativa dominant strain. This combination relaxes neck/shoulder muscles and gives energy to get things done. Easy to socialize on in public and not appear buzzed.‚Äù"

I'm the middle of the road type of gaI when I go out, I don't like to have a super head high or super couch locked high. Dr. Who is a perfect combination of both!

I have crohns disease and it fully takes away my stomach pain allowing me to relax and calm down. I have an appetite and am able to eat after having smoked this.
