I suggest taking only one hit on the first go. Not because the high is super intense, but because you can build up a tolerance and it's best with CBD strains to take it easy so this doesn't happen quickly, to get the full benefits. The first time I tried it, right in the beginning of the high I started to get an unpl...”"
