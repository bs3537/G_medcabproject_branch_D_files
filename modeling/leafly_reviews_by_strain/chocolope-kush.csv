Chocolope Kush
=============
PieRomania,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chocolope-kush/reviews/1416872,"‚ÄúChocolate Kush has been one of the staples in my medicine cabinet for nearly 2 years now. It's an extremely well-rounded hybrid that honestly doesn't seem sativa dominant to me. Maybe I'm consuming a different breeder's Chocolate Kush, but regardless, this strain I keep receiving is wonderful.
