Better if you grind it and do a one hitter.  Tends to last longer than most I've tried.  Anxiety level is way lower and I can actually have a conversation without getting stuck. As for pain...it does help.  Taking a piece of medicinal chocolate heightens the body high to relax more and no pain...”"
