I find it has a unique body to mind high that is very equal in effect. Both the indica and sativa characteristics of this strain can be felt without one dominating the other. I thought it would couch-lock me, but I feel quite alert and focused. I like this strain for mid-day or early evening sessions for relaxing. It feels like I have...”"
