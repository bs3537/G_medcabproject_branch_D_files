Cascadierra,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/platinum-calyx/reviews/1505393,"“Like all good herb, the first thing you notice when tearing into a tasty bud is the smell and the almost blueberry coffee cake aroma. Definitely gets the appetite stirred.  As well I love the look and shape of the bud. It has these awesome snow capped Calyx peaks that stick out with hint of purple. I can really see why they named their company Calyx. 
    When I try a new strain I like to smoke with my morning coffee...”"
