CBDizzly,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-skunk/reviews/1410030,"“HIGH CBD LOW THC STRAIN REVIEW

Excellent pain relief, antiinflammatory, and quick relief from muscle spasms.
Moderately potent sedative effect, this high CBD strain is great for bedtime.”"
BuzzIightyear,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-skunk/reviews/1410032,"“I was really surprised with this strain. I expected a big body high, but I actually felt a lot of energy after a few hits only. It also helped me a lot to take away my headache and stress from work. I would say it felt more like an hybrid to me. Perfect to smoke right after work to get a little kick, but not meanwhile cause I couldn't concentrate at all ! Very good weed overall for a good price ( 35usd/oz) in Mexico.”"
pollydaparrot,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-skunk/reviews/1410033,"“Very intense cerebral high. I found it's most intense if I'm just relaxing before bed and watching TV. Don't really get the munchies with this strain, usually end up just tripping out with my eyes closed, which is fine by me! In my top 5 favorite strains though, would 100% recommend!”"
spectorbcn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-skunk/reviews/1410029,"“Really in love with this strain at the moment. Bugs are dark, dense and full of resin. Tastes and smells like the Himalayas, pine forests, earth, grass, fresh and with a strong citrus note. Effects are a great mellow indica high, no couch lock but a nice floaty relaxation. Made me want to eat everything in the house. Would buy again”"

Aroma/Taste: You can tell Skunk #1's in this strain. I don't really taste much other than an earthy taste.
High: Very sedating for me, normally I have to take benadryl to make me tired, but this strain slowly washes over your body. You feel your eyelids are heavy & then you notice your stomach growling. That was the fastest acting indica I've ever had. Within 5 minutes of dab...”"
davecain,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-skunk/reviews/1373752,"“The afghan shunk #1 that I've been smoking throughout the summer 2016 is indoor grown. The taste & smell profile is very sweet, & piney almost like cotton candy meets New England pine. 

Ok the high is absolutely time bending. Minutes will be hours and hours can be minutes. Although this strain is very indica dominant it gives you sativa euphoria ala Irish Kush. Very smooth, relaxing indica high with little couch loc...”"
Dpopoff,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-skunk/reviews/1380440,"“I had this strain under the name Silver Skunk. Such an amazing strain. Smells of citrus, mainly pineapple. It's a 70-30 indica dominant strain, and hits perfectly. Very smooth toke, but it loses it's citrus taste.”"
Exolight,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-skunk/reviews/1413054,"“Full disclosure, I don't have a ton of experience with Indicas.

This Indica seems different from others in that you actually feel a little innervated while on it. It can and will put you to sleep if taken before bed, though. It took roughly 8-10 minutes to fully kick in for me, and after it did I found myself following my cat around the back yard singing him the "Ocean Man" song. Very relaxing but not couch locking....”"
bignastywood,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghan-skunk/reviews/1335177,"“I tested this strain from the mmjthc in vernon,bc. Beautiful looking flower, tricomes are definitely there and do they ever glisten, great job to the grower.
     This strain is a very nice strain for bedtime or if you simply have pain and want to relax. It has a very nice taste and smell. I just find that near the end of a joint it gets more harsh than other strains will.
    Oh i must say if you have a problem eati...”"

Tiene unos cogollos gordos, compactos, fuertes, con un olor bastante intenso, verde intensos de color.

Sabor y olor en claro estilo "skunk", entre pungente y "maloro skunk" bastante claro, y después, deja un sabor más seco, a tierra a madera.
Optima indica, deja una sensación de relajación general importante, baja rapidamente tensión y stress. Perfecta antes de acostarme, para relajarme mejor y reducir mi...”"

It smokes real nice though in a joint and smells and looks good. I use for anxiety to calm down, and sometimes i use marijuana to focus and be awake. This did neither.
