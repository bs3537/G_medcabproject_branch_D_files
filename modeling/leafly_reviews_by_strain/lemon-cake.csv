Lemon Cake

weazal,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1410758,"“Not unlike a hit of caffeine from coffee. Speediness in the body expressed through physical energy and a desire to move. Turbos you up up to 10. Mind is noticeably disabled. Higher thinking is tamped out forcing you to relax and not think much. Would be a challenge at work or any situation where you have to recall things. You’d be left grasping for too long. The positive side effect is it spaces you the fuck out! Ser...”"

nevercryshitwolf,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1506491,"“Whoa.. wasn’t expecting that. After making it through about a third of joint I felt a rush grab me by the chest then made its way to my head and stayed there... for like 2 1/2 hours I didn’t move. Spun. I also got the dizzy side effects as mentioned in other posts. It fades after about 20-30 min. And leaves you on the moon. Weeeeee”"
SarahBitt17,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1575267,"“The caffeine kick out of this is great! This definitely got me going/put me in a great mood. When I was busy I didnt notice the hunger. I would have some cake then run or cycle. Love this strain. For me it didnt subside pain enough but it is still one of my top favs.”"
dannysmokesweed,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1447032,"“It's a great strain, I'm more of an indica guy myself but this had a good taste, and it's pretty strong.”"
verymedicated,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1420478,"“This strain is definitely flavorful , I'm using flash wet and the citrus and sweet highlights are obvious before I even spark it . The high is very good euphoric energetic high that allows the user to have the painkiller effects of a indica and the great energy feel of sativa”"
jojoshorty,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1548408,"“LOVED this strain so much. this is my first review. if you need a strain that's great for morning smoking or smoke a small bowl before you go to something you're nervous about. combatted my anxiety wonderfully, made me feel energetic and creative as all get out. not to mention it smells BOMB. I love lemon, this smells just like lemon cake. highly recommend!!!”"
glittr2k,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1633231,"“this is one of my favorite strains, and I have only said that about 3 other times. I didnt expect it to have the very pleasant mild body high it had, and it's actually a pretty great strain for pain relief which was also surprising coming from a sativa. It doesn't impair me, other than making me a tad bit "slower" (I prefer "dreamier") depending on dose. I recommend for situations where you want to relax while mainta...”"
AG28,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1566652,"“Usually not a huge fan of higher thc Sativa’s but this one is an amazing strain for me! It doesn’t give me the racey high that most do. It was a very well balanced high, able to focus and get things done, be creative but still be relaxed and calm not plagued with anxiety or depression.”"
Cannibeans,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1783497,"“Delicious, lemony scent with some very potent flavors. Picked up an ounce from a local vendor in Las Vegas and it's been a great daily strain. The high is clear, allows me to enjoy it while still being productive and is wonderful in joints as well.”"

batty84,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1547240,"“A little goes a long way, but for me, it goes in the right direction. Small hits of this get me through a night shift better than any caffeine. The paranoia was a bit much, but I also felt more in control than usual. I recommend this, but start small!”"
Jkendy41,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1529714,"“Very pungent cheesy aroma. Tons of trichomes and great flavor. Dense hard nugs too. I'm feeling relaxed”"

CBD 0%
THC 20.4%
Terpenes 3.5%

So that's my label. I'm smoking a joint and I hit a couple a bowls on a bong. Very relaxing, yet energetic. The smell is awesome! Lemon more than cheese but the cheesiness lingers. Perfect for a lunch break toke.”"

Theretrophysique,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1739220,"“I hated the ounce I grabbed of this. Hits slow as hell, creates a confusing high that made me want to smoke more. A couch lock sativa that will make you remember every terrible thing in your life. Yikes. Nugs were huge and tied bag made my apartment smell like skunk so it was definitely dank just a strain that didn’t work well with me. I might smoke a gram or two but trying to self medicate was hard on this.”"

TerpsforDayz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1496303,"“Nicely shaped buds, smells like lemon cheesecake and tastes like it in a vaporizer.  I'm not a fan of the cheese flavor although I do enjoy citrus flavors in my cannabis.  It feels slightly sativa dominant with a spacey somewhat cerebral buzz.  Good for stress and getting simple tasks done.”"

SkyCo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1691844,"“A great tasting Sativa packed with a little energy and amazing for killing fatigue. I always keep a little of this around the house when I need it. When a long week is dragging you down, this is the perfect strain to bring you back to baseline. A little boost of energy and focus accompanies the citrus taste. A cerebral high that sets you in your seat and gets you ready to tackle the day. If you are working hard throu...”"

Kilgortrout,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1616323,"“There was a significant delay before the high hit and when it hit it was strong!

Rose-colored glasses feeling similar to Sour Diesel. Would recommend to patients who are looking for motivational, energetic strains or to help with depression. Nice to have a sativa without the anxiety. Paranoia level: 0/10.”"

fuzzyleaf,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1561356,"“An amazing high, one of the best I've experienced, the one downside is the awful taste. Now this could just be how the weed I got was grown but the general taste should be across the board. Would still recommend to anyone but it's hard to smoke several bowls in a row without the taste getting to you.”"
Stonedtacoma,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1665124,"“the taste is on point. upon hitting a Fireline Lemon Cake preroll, I get instant hints of cheese and citrus. this heavy sativa helped me combat stress and anxiety. if you're looking for a strain that tastes amazing and has that heady buzz you get from sativa's, try this one.”"
flyinghighsigninglow,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1715450,"“This strain packs a punch! I really mean that! After smoking one spliff i thought this would be a mild high and nothing special. I was so wrong. Maybe 20 or 30 minutes later it hit like a train. Its effects are potent and definitely uplighting, it's a sativa through and through, the high is pleasant but i wasn't expecting this kinda potency! don't make too many important plans while smoking this stuff... great strain...”"
Kilgortrout,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1627228,"“This strain makes a beautiful lemony smoke that engulfs your face; it’s a great feeling. I enjoyed this a lot with a strong head kick. However a little later I had my first bout of mj related paranoia and dizziness. It is tempting to try it again but I’m leery of those negative side effects!”"
LadyMinorB,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1803980,"“I'm a variety strain kind of gal, with an affinity for the cerebral uplifting effects and cognitive reframing effects of cannabis. This strain got me right away with increased energy and lift in depression in one good inhale. It came as a recommendation from the always helpful Jeremiah at Urban Greenhouse. Great staff, always helpful.”"

I wont buy it again and I bought and used the product in disilite form. taste phenomenal though”"

It read 21.21% thc and .39% cbd. Looks are ok. Scraggly long fluffy sticky buds dull greens and dull orange hairs. Smell is amazingly good immediately picks my mood up from the scent.

tripleabanana,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-cake/reviews/1451889,"“For all my occasional smokers out there: smoke a lil bit of this and you'll feel pretty sleezy. Smoke just a little too much and you might get dizzy. 

I don't know if it's just me but the first night I smoked this as a real small joint I was dizzy for about 20 mins before throwing up. But after that, I felt fine. smoked smaller portions after that.”"
