Tuna Kush
=============
HammockDistrict,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tuna-kush/reviews/1415031,"“This bud looked unappealing at first and then like others I started to notice how covered and thick it is with trichomes and long orange and red hairs. The buds are super dense and smell just like tuna with a side of kushy skunk. After smoking a bowl, the lower half of my body felt like it was filled with sand (woooo!) and all pain, mental and physical, was numbed. Perfect weed to help you forget Americans just elect...”"
getsquanchedon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tuna-kush/reviews/1372416,"“"That actually smells like tuna!"

A really nice Indica that tastes pungent and doesn't hit you too hard. Took away all of the ache and stress of a 12 hour day on my feet. Has some very happy cerebral effects and makes your body feel relaxed without being too sleepy. Don't expect to get much done, though. Except eat. You'll eat a lot. Why not have a tuna sandwich?”"
extremenorthern,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tuna-kush/reviews/1375475,"“Enjoyed this strain. Nice smoke a bit harsh but then when the wave of the THC hits you it relaxes and mind goes blank. Lol that really helps me because my mind seems to go a mile a minute and hard to slow or stop for sleep. This one worked for me and all my aches and pains went away!”"
Knagawa,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tuna-kush/reviews/1415032,"“Wowser!! This one is a doozy. Be well prepared for a trip that we'll take you on not only a cerebral high but also a couch lock body buzz. STRONG STRAIN!”"

Anyways, Tuna Kush was an amazing experience. My friend would constantly talk about this strain he tried out in another province and being in an illegal province, having strains like Tuna Kush wa...”"
jacobo1997,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tuna-kush/reviews/1365503,"“If you ask me I'd say this is the most amazing strain of them all.  I've done this strain multiple times and it has never let me down. My kind of high with this strain is trippy AF and it allows me to open my imagination and creativity to a new level concluding into a deep heavy sleep.

You can also experience a nice body high and relax yourself while watching films.
Definitely in my top 3 strains”"
Laxxboy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tuna-kush/reviews/1558222,"“1. Burn Color - snow white
2. Taste - Earthy but slightly sweet, typical  Tuna dank taste
3. Effects - much more cerebral than expected, got me dancing in my room right now by myself, also good analgesic
4. Other +/-  I could literally go clubbing on this strain
5. 8.5/10”"
VanIslandCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tuna-kush/reviews/1370643,"“When I first saw how small the buds were on Tuna Kush I thought I got ripped off, but at second gance they are loaded with trichomes and dark orange hairs, looks almost frosty. The smell was skunky/hashy - heavy smoke, reminded me of pink kush on the exhale. Beautiful relaxing effects, but it'll knock you right out if you smoke too much of it.”"
Togy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tuna-kush/reviews/1359390,"“First off, this stuff is STAAAAANKY! A beautiful deep and bold earthy/skunky aroma with hints of what I can only describe as "beef Raman". A wonderful smoke, does wonderers for relaxation. Although it is a indica, I found it very very functional. 8.8/10 would smoke again”"

sumpliicity,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tuna-kush/reviews/1357847,"“Such an amazing high. Smokes really nice, and it keeps you relaxed and euphoric. Also helped me with sleep. No negatives things to say about this one !!”"

ZineRat,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tuna-kush/reviews/1479990,"“I bought an oil cart with Tuna, but also had grape flavouring.

While I can't accurately comment about the true flavour of this strain, the effect is pretty relaxing. It's very relaxing and laid back, but sometimes a little head spinning.

Not really my favourite, but I'm more of a sativa person anyways.”"

classicbenny,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tuna-kush/reviews/1655139,"“I smoked my ‘usual’ amount with this strain and it put me on my ass. It hit me hard. I typically smoke sativa hybrids but this was a nice change up. A very powerful ‘fishy’ musk came from the bag when I opened initially. Very unique. Highly recommend this strain for people looking to relax and socialize.”"

It provides calmness and mental clarity, as well as a great deal of fatigue causing you to sleep and its overall impact on calmness, persists for 6-8 hours.

Tuna also induces serious hunger and is a wonderful sleep aid. Tuna has similar head effects to its’ Hindu parent.
