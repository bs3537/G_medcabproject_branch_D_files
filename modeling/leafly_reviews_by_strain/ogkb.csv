jusy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogkb/reviews/1697563,"“Super nice strain to smoke, only recently available in shops and ever since it’s one of my no.1 to go strains. Great before bed, and chill vibe but I can still focus and do work. 9/10 for me”"
Epuslay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogkb/reviews/1734003,"“I think the flavor takes away from the enjoyment of the buzz I get.  It's not bad stuff but the flavor is deep with the stuff I bought.”"
Smokeologist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ogkb/reviews/1742813,"“Great strain. Definitely munchies for sure!  Smelled great, taste really good. Like good smokers want their flowers to taste!  Get it, you’ll enjoy it...just be ready to eat!  Great for anyone lacking an appetite.”"

From the flavor to the high and the relief I receive from chronic pain and great sleep this is a wonderful strain. I have permanent nerve damage that caused pain until I started using marijuana now I have more days without pain than I do with. I also have sleep apnea which requires a cpap strains like most kushes especially this one help me slee...”"
