aliceinwonderland17,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/venice-og/reviews/1283474,"“I've never had a sativa that made me want to go on more adventures than this strain. Very uplifting, happy, and creative. It's about 25% thc so the high will definitely creep up. Good to smoke with friends!”"

That is, until I tried this one. Definite day-time strain, but you can still go to sleep with it. I highly recommend this strain, especially good for work.”"

Chi420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/venice-og/reviews/1062363,"“Just picked this up and I have to say I'm pretty happy with it so far. The buds are a nice size, very leafy with a lot of purple and even some red. Strong sativa effects, definitely won't smoke this at night, but have to say I'm pretty stoked to smoke it and get some work done. Definitely worth trying it out, better than a lot of other sativas I've tried.”"

BrainPain,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/venice-og/reviews/1237596,"“Tried for level 8 headache. Didn't drop the pain down as much as I'd hope, but made me not care about it. The tingly feeling that comes with it is fun and relieving to a certain extent. Makes my feet and hands very cold, so cold others notice so it isn't just a sensation. Since head is bad, I do want to drop the pain enough to sleep. While I don't feel knocked out and definitely can get stuff done, this doesn't keep ...”"

MAT3RIALIST,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/venice-og/reviews/1168220,"“I really enjoyed the high that this strain gives. The bud itself has a beautiful look. Sativa strains are my favorite, and this one is among those special strains. It fades you but at the same time you are sharp and aware of time.”"
LeoV562,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/venice-og/reviews/1202458,"“Super bomb buds! This bud doesn't make me feel lethargic, rather  quite the opposite. I can complete all my daily tasks but still be on a good fade. If you find this strain at your local dispensary, I highly suggest you pick some up and give it a try. You won't be disappointed!”"
GanjaInfoSec,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/venice-og/reviews/1293811,"“Delicous, piney. Tastes like chemdawg, urkle, Flo, oaxacan and thai purple sativas with some Sour Diesel and SF Valley OG Kush highlights... Def has some himalayan kush as well as kashmiri leaf formations. So bomb!!!”"
