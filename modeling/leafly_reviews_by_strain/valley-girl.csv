I picked up and 8th of their beautiful valley girl og after finding out it was and SFV/Faceoff cross. Ive loved the intensity off Faceoff, but couldnt smoke it without inevitable anxiety if i hit a few too many, so I hoped the SFV would ease that.

If you want that good feeling(positive vibes only type),  get you some  valley girl. I’ve been a smoker for 10 years and statin reminds me of the reason why I started. Heavy on the head  and makes your  mouth dry but well worth it.”"
Patient42O,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valley-girl/reviews/1299308,"“Absolutely incredible. OG heaven for us OG lovers. Had me super couch locked for the 3 minutes after exhale. Even after I got up I still have that Pine zest across my tongue. My balance was slightly off, for a second only, but who doesn't love that intense feeling. Stress gone. Fun level, up. No bullsh*t  allowed. 
I was able to manipulate it to help me sleep, and I stayed asleep. That's always nice.

Valley girl, ha...”"

BaronOfBud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valley-girl/reviews/1284169,"“Valley Girl Nug Run from Prime extractions. I've only been able to find it in The Valley or LA due to its scarcity, great indica dominance, a full body stone with some cerebral head ... Without a doubt one of the tastiest concentrates I've had!”"
MrHerbsMan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valley-girl/reviews/1351679,"“Got a sample of this out of Denver that was delicious. Has almost a perfume or floral taste that is very subtle and unique. Nothing very special about the buzz, but maybe the bit that I had wasn't grown to its full potential. I would buy it again for the right price.”"
bunninuts,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valley-girl/reviews/1357054,"“For high anxiety and depression, this is the best I've found. Slows the mind of stress, relaxes the tummy, and tops it off with high desire to be productive. Not necessarily creative but I've been cleaning my house with a giggly smile 🥓 I tried the flower and it smells great and tastes better ❤”"

def1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valley-girl/reviews/1280236,"“Valley Girl is an interesting mix of SFV OG and Fire OG - they come together to make a very balanced hybrid. The effect is very euphoric and happy and would be great for those with anxiety or depression. A slight body high but I still feel energetic and ready to tackle the day. The organic cut I got was a little leafy and is lacking on bag appeal, but the high more than makes up for it. 4/5”"
esoteric0781,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valley-girl/reviews/1411075,"“Having anxiety problems i tend to stay away from the ones with anxious or paranoia effects. This one was one of the worst for me, very unpleasant. I ended up making edibles with it. To each their own. I envy those of you that don't have those issues because this seems to be a very highly rated strain.”"
