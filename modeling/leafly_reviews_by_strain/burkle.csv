After the euphoria passed, I was still very relaxed and in a good mood. I did smoke it and go back inside and was told that I reeked so I would use caution when smoking around people who are easily offended by the smell.”"
gnarly_pinkbean,https://www.leafly.com/indica/burkle/reviews/1359450,"“Burkle is one of my all time favorite Indicas and I smoke it as often as I can.  A good batch of Burkle should smell a little spicy and sweet at the same time. You should feel your eyelids drop a little when that aroma hits your nose.  A really good strain if you have trouble sleeping like I do.  Usually I sleep throughout the night when I smoke a few bowls in my bong.  Highly recommend for any Indica lover.”"

The smell and flavor are unreal and the effects are fast hitting and long lasting. Great for someone that struggles with insomnia.”"
DrNnja,https://www.leafly.com/indica/burkle/reviews/1296800,"“I love this strain! It makes me completely happy and stress free. Even makes me lay there and just laugh....even when all by myself. That never happens, and I live in Denver and try many many strains.”"

Hondo13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/burkle/reviews/1495890,"“My new favorite. Burkle is awesomeness. With pre 98 bubba x grandaddy purple you can't go wrong. Very happy relaxing high that will put your ass to sleep. The smell and taste are amazing and the high is second to none. Very good pain relief as well. It helped my crohn's and back pain immensely. Made me sleep like a baby.”"

fallenangel5000,https://www.leafly.com/indica/burkle/reviews/1346328,"“Heavy stuff.  A bowl shared with my babe left me totally relaxed and couchlocked, he was off in the kitchen rummaging for munchies.  Great auditory supplementation, perfect for lazy days listening to music or watching a good movie.  Decent head change accompanies the body high.  Will cause a bit of a headache if you're greedy though!”"

wlp9279,https://www.leafly.com/indica/burkle/reviews/1765906,"“This is the first time I have ever tried this strain and it gives me a burning sensation in my throat that does not feel like it is associated with THC. The feeling is compared to smoking paper. Granted I could’ve got a bad batch or this may be a knockoff. I mean, I feel it working, it’s just the harsh burn that cones with it. I hoped for a smoother tasted that fit the visual but it is what it is.”"

For the last 4 days I have been at the mercy of relying on local in my old home state . Came back to the west coast and here we are Burkel . What a great tasting flavor and the buzz is right on point , early wake and bake for me . Love the taste , like a dark berry wine with a bitter sharpness at the end . Instant calming over the he...”"

ampoladevin99,https://www.leafly.com/indica/burkle/reviews/1195749,"“I would have never guessed this was indica because it keeps me so awake and focused. The first time I used this strain, I cleaned my entire house. And that says a lot because I'm extremely lazy.”"

I have a pretty high tolerance, and this one really took the edge off. This particular sample was a bit dry and slightly purple with a very dense, Kush-type bud structure.
My next sesh I have to mix this with a Diesel and...”"
