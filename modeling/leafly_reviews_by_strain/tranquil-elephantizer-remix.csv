I got this T.E. from Nirvana in Phx. and the color was amazing; purple and green with plenty of orange and sugar.

It has some earthy tones but is a bit hashy. Not harsh but fairly strong. The only reason I didn't give this strain a 5 star is due to the taste. 

Overall I'd recommend this strain and am very please...”"

heavn420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tranquil-elephantizer-remix/reviews/1378691,"“Not my favorite tasting strains...gives a harsh burn to the back of your throat upon inhale; exhale is slightly less harsh and the remaining taste isn't as bad. Ive tasted better...tasted worse. Buds are frosty with some purple hues and orange hairs. 

This strain works well to produce relaxing, calming effects. At times it's left me couch locked but not always. I would recommend for anxiety reducing, sleep inducing,...”"

Biohaz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tranquil-elephantizer-remix/reviews/1479223,"“I usually hate smoking, and generally vape because of the very light taste and feel. This was on sale so I got a few grams. I will be getting more. I don’t think the taste is harsh, and I haven’t coughed yet. The euphoria is gradual, but washes over you. I feel light, pain free, and relaxed. I will be able to fall asleep quickly and easily tonight.”"

Pros: Fast acting. Body and pain relief. Calms the mind. 

Cons: Harsh pull, as someone else mentioned, on the back of the throat. Dry Eyes & Mouth.

Overall/Other: Earthy and hash taste with hints of pepper. Some hunger and sleepyness. It's a indica thats good fpr relaxation and pain, but the mild harshness knocks it down a peg. 

I would recommend this strain if your ok or...”"

On  the taste, if I just barely flashed the bowl with fire, the terpene hit on the cut I had was ok. The next hit lighting the bowl all the way, yeah harsh, very earthy.

 The nugs are dense with super frosty trichomes and it has an earthy scent with hints of berry. The taste is super sweet with a finish that is pure sappy, pine in the best way. 

 The heavy Indica body high is the first thing that sets in and it can almost be a little too heavy if you aren't expecting it. I think this may have something to do with why some folks write a...”"
