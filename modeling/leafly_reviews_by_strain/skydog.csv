Oh Canada! Been hanging steady with this strain, a 70/30 Indica dominate that never makes me pass out, awesome! Others may need that sleepy hybrid, but Sky Dog is so fun, it will make you snore with a eventual, "can't wait to wake up and do it again" smile on your face...”"

FRANKENLOVER,https://www.leafly.com/indica/skydog/reviews/1302606,"“Pretty crystals; harsh diesel taste; overall, helped me sink down into the darkness after a stressful day”"
Riddlechip,https://www.leafly.com/indica/skydog/reviews/1325928,"“As an avid indica fan this was the right strain for me, very heavy behind the eyes combined with full body relaxation. The smell is quite pungent with a strong emphasis on sweetness combined with skunky notes. As for the taste it was on the stronger side and pungent but a good change.  The high was enjoyable and I somewhat felt more concentrated and focused, a truly enjoyable  sedation.”"

Stere0killa,https://www.leafly.com/indica/skydog/reviews/1547228,"“Top 3 of all time. beautiful mellow high that picks you up right off the first few tokes and keeps you in a glowing aura type high that is hard to find. Perfect flowers just oodled with crystals. You just cant go wrong with a cone full of skydog. 👌”"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/indica/skydog/reviews/1308971,"“Skydog provides a very mellow, relaxing high with good pain relief. It's best consumed in the evenings when you plan to stay in. It did make me feel sleepy within about an hour after vaping. Overall a stellar strain for pain relief and to facilitate sleep. Would recommend :o)”"

SaskiaHamilton,https://www.leafly.com/indica/skydog/reviews/1151674,"“Excellent strain. Would not put it under my favorites but it went down easily when smoking. Coughed a little too much on a bong as it is a slightly dry strain. Still good, non the less.”"
