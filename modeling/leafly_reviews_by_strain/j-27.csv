J-27
=============
D.B.GEN.,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1398564,"“This is a solid Sativa strain. It is the parent of the now popular Tangerine or Tangie cross, it has been passed off as Grapefruit by some although it is a much better strain than the GF, effect wise. It is the citrus smell that has made the name get thrown around, as it appears even by Leafly's review not many seem to know the real history. Let me explain it. It has no Jack in it although I know how that rumor got s...”"

Amount Consumed: 0.12g
Physical Description: Dense, dry flower which contains reddish-orange hairs prominently.
Taste Profile: citrus mixed with a more grounded/earthy flavor.
Pros: the bud is incredibly potent, allowing the user to smoke tiny portions while still maintaining an intense, focused high. Creativity comes more easily, and the social nature of J-27 allows the user to remai...”"

Once I finally stopped giggling & found the couch, I had some crazy fun dreams that were borderline acid trip material.  It's been 25 years since that, but wow.  I woke up the next morning & all I could think was "I don't know WTF that was, but it was f'ing cool".  HIGHLY RECOMMEND”"

No joke this stuff will have you zipping around from thing to thing,thoughts coming and going. Smoking before bed is a no go, your mind will be racing and you will lay in a half awake dream state for a good hour. But for day time or morning,it was an interesting buzz. The batch i got wasnt the usuall 5star quality,but was a solid 3star bud(with 1bein brick/reg/...”"

I use this when hiking or going on walks.
makes me feel positive,  motivated, and creative.”"
comixologist,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1063209,"“This was recommended to me as a peppy sativa that was potent and consistent, good for motivation and focus (I needed something to keep my ADD in check while I was writing papers).  I bought a gram, packed my water pipe's bowl and fired up, but instead of a pleasantly uplifted and creative mindset I felt no mental or physical change.  I waited thirty or forty-five minutes, just to be sure, packed a second bowl, and tr...”"

Once again, hellza bomb”"
saadz420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1261384,"“I've been smoking a cross of this and White Widow, and let me tell you, this strain has multiple tricks up its sleeve. For me, it starts out with an intense burst of energy for the first hour and a half, maybe 2 hours. After that, a huge sleepy and hungry couch - lock feeling sets in, unless you smoke more. I would recommend smoking this out of a J at least once, the flavor is nice and citrusy, along with the smell.”"
crazycolton55,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1319515,"“This weed when broken up smells like a sweet weed with a slight hint of pungent. Then when inhaled you immediately taste the overwhelmingly citrus flavor followed by a pungent dank aftertaste. This weed will shoot you to the stars and give you the energy required to as well. 4/5!”"
surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1325198,"“Next best thing to Jack Herer.
Super Sativa! 
Helped me go go go. Extra citrus flavors intermixed with pungent tones provide a delicious experience. Top shelf indeed. I am sticking with this one. If anyone knows the true genetics of J~27 please let me know. 
Spread the word, this strain is wonderful.”"

lezfarmer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1673196,"“I fell into a fit of laughter a few minutes after smoking. It didn't take long to kick in and I felt great, both very happy and full of energy. I definitely wouldn't reccomend it for focus though, I was having difficulty comprehending simple questions.”"
grannygear,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1063211,"“This strain is very similar to Jack Herer.  It gives me energy, and I sometimes do housework with it.”"

DDimebagLA,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1244069,"“Very strong strain. Instantly worked, and lasted a good while.”"
jaxygyrl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1335034,"“This medium green flower has deep, golden veins and distinctly over-ripe citrus smell.

After a few minutes, the silly, giggly, bounce-to-music magic begins. Get work done? doubt-it. Be inspired to write/paint/create? I'm not feeling the focus here, but that could be me/now/mercury-in-retrograde. J-27 is a nice little party where it's all good.”"
grannygear,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1063210,"“A good Sativa, similar to Jack Herer in many ways.”"
NaturesWayMedicine,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1695790,"“Now available at Philadelphia despensaries is 27. Patients who have tried this flower say it allows you to focus and concentrate easily. They say its great for daytime use and for medical conditions such chronic pains, nausea, migraines and even depression. 27 smells just as it taste, citrusy, lemony and earthy. The flower has lots of orange hairs and dense bright green buds.”"

yondeezy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/j-27/reviews/1063218,"“I was looking for a good sativa strain and the budtender suggested this. It felt very soft and had nice orange strains on it so it looked promising. The taste itself was nice, but the buzz was pretty mellow. You get a nice mellow sativa head buzz going, but it's nothing to write home about. Not too intense, but not a total disappointment. It's just average. Your head buzz is light enough that you can still carry out ...”"
