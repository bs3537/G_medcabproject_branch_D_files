After both of those failed to relieve any pain I got my hands on some Lee Roy and he can finally get relaxed enough to fall asleep and stay asleep! It also helps slice through my anxiety like a fucking samurai sword lol!!
Stay lifted my friends ✌🏻🍃😊”"
tayloroshea321,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lee-roy/reviews/1361484,"“Top 10 strains I have ever smoked. From FL where Triangle Kush originates and is one of my all time favorite buds. Amazing taste, full resinous sticky buds, and amazing relaxed Stoney but clear headed high. Good for any activity . Amazing strain by House of Dankness. 10/10”"
morbidmunchkin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lee-roy/reviews/1388080,"“Best sleep ever. No waking up in the middle of the night from pain or anxiety. Best for night time use; it is super heavy.”"
erasetheprocess,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lee-roy/reviews/1419365,"“Wow. Piney. REAL piney, with a strong and lasting aftertaste. Think of the first part of Chem Scout, but make it last. Pretty harsh and comforting at once. 

Nice "cloudy, floating headbuzz," pretty quickly after initial inhalation. 

I don't write reviews on here real often. It takes something special to make me do that. I'm digging this one. You will as well”"
JorgeG62,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lee-roy/reviews/1391362,"“Gooey good and strong, pain just melts away.  So does stress.  So do a couple of hours if you're not careful, so be judicious.  Kiefalicious and frosty. Nicely manicured small and uniform green and rusty orange nugs.  Hashy earthy rich deep smoke.  Great effort from NETA.”"

CannibalCarni,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lee-roy/reviews/1361485,"“I really enjoyed this strain but not for the reasons it advertises. Although it is an indica, I experienced far more sativa effects.
After smoking this strain I got very hyper, was stupidly goofy, and enjoyed every minute of it! I felt really creative and would "meld" into the movie I was watching (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World). As the night wore on a sense of relaxation calmed me, but I was never tired enough to slee...”"

NETA lists this flower as a hybrid/Sativa which contradicts Leafly and Allbud as they both state Indica hybrid.

Dark forest green with dark orange pistils, nice coating of fine white trichomes. Smells of forest or woodsy with notes of pepper as well. Tastes of peppercorn and slight pine pu...”"

But this Lee roy had calmed me I like it.”"
LaidbackManor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lee-roy/reviews/1361488,"“I'm sorry but I can't help to love this lovely Indica Strain. Love all the Citrus flavors,  with me being a Floridian... and all :)”"
bowlito,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lee-roy/reviews/1361695,"“Picked up a gram to try it out and it was great. Found myself glued to the couch. Hungry and happy. This was great for my anxiety and helped with pain also.”"
StephanieTope,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lee-roy/reviews/1493975,"“Although it was only sold in grams, I was highly impressed!!! This strand does alllll it says. And I would add that its a great sleep aid for those who have nerve damage. Also, helps focus any person. So I wouldn't let the ADD turn you away. Extreme multitaskers, procrastinators and even cancer patients can benefit greatly!!! Kudos to the breeder!!!”"
Smokinsince95,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lee-roy/reviews/1526025,"“Shocked and disgusted this strain only has 16 now 17 reviews... likes Scotts OG this is the more flavorful of the RD Triangle Kush Crosses v the more potent Scott's, on occasion. This has a soft flavor of lime and a slight Chemy flavor. Great for when I'm nauseated or my arthritis is flared up or I have any inflammation at all. Another of my favorites from Rare Dankness”"

This strain does not have this effect on me. I’ve been using some Lee Roy wax and it tastes amazing with what I would describe as a cookie-like taste. The high off the wax has been intense but not too much so (as mentioned before.) 

On my next trip to the dispensary I got some Lee Roy flower. It smells ver...”"
MissStoneyKitten,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lee-roy/reviews/1641071,"“I love it.. But you are listing it as Indica Hybrid.  A couple of reviews cite other sources and list an analysis that indicates Sativa.  I took it before bed and stayed up all night solving the problems of the world.
My internal dope meter points strongly to the Sativa side.  
   May NOT cause drowsiness ... (lol) .. its great for body pains  and wonderful for depression -- calming, uplifting and euphoria...
  Perha...”"

nikki_nicole,https://www.leafly.com/indica/lee-roy/reviews/1671539,"“This strain is great! After the first hit, I was instantly not stressed out anymore. I felt calm for the first time in weeks. It doesn’t make me drowsy or make me feel lazy like other Indica’s. My pain is mostly gone, but I also feel like being productive. Having said that, I agree with the statement “it should be classified a Sativa hybrid.”.”"
