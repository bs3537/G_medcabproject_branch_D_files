I bought a small amount to give it a try & was really blown away at effect & over all experience. 
The peppery effects has potential of making one cough hard.

JorundHallthor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/nuclear-cookies/reviews/1663466,"“This is a potent and long lasting high. The onset is slightly gentle and very euphoric, until you realize how incredibly high you are from such small amounts. Very easy to fall asleep using this strain, but it will not force you to sleep as some indica strains do. The taste is very earthy and has notes of pine and diesel. Also good for knocking out a headache or stomachache. Highly recommend giving it a try.”"
