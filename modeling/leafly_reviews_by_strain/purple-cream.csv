Just found it through a local delivery service in SW Washington state (yes possession is legal here now but you still have to be medical to legally obtain it - don't say buy - buying is still illegal). I have generalized anxiety disorder. I'm naturally the kind of person that freaks out after one cup of coffee. For me this is almost as good as xanax. I have a prescription for xanax and also a presc...”"

Alot of ppl aren't sure what strains were crossed to make this beautiful plant. I have a good friend whose been growing for over 25 yrs, an old OG hippie. I wanted him to prove to me that purple cream really was (purple urkle x GDP x purple urkle), so he grew it and sure enough it had the same look,smell, taste, an...”"
gigaza,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cream/reviews/1084163,"“Purple Cream was picked by my sister and she seemed pretty excited for it for whatever her reasons were. It is a dense and floral looking strain, that is dark green and purple. The nugs are cured well and smell terrific, of dark spices and skunkiness. It smokes quickly as it is dense and brittle, and provides a thick and somewhat harsh smoke. Cough-producing. The smoke tastes a lot like licorice and nutmeg to me.. it...”"
MrMedi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cream/reviews/1417397,"“This is my First encounter with the wonderful strain Purple Cream. I was a tad skeptical at first, due to the name. The buds are so aesthetically pleasing its almost unreal. Large Medium-Dense Crystal Coated Light Green and Purple Buds made up the QP I purchased. There's more purple than green. The flavour is very mellow and sweet, with the slightest hint of Candy or a purple Popsicle in there. Excellent when looking...”"

Hydromorphone,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cream/reviews/1084168,"“Best I've had in recent history. Does make you a little tired and unmotivated, but if you can kick it in it can be worked on. Helped my anxiety and back pain. My dad really liked this one and it reminded him of stuff he had as a kid.”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cream/reviews/1223563,"“Very lazy and relaxing but not euphoric. It's a solid one-note strain... I deal with a fair amount of anxiety, so Purple Cream is great if I all I want to do is watch a movie and go to bed.”"
nanadee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cream/reviews/1084161,"“First time using Purple Creme. Am trading my usual nighttime indica (GDP) for this - and so far I am liking it - but not sure I want to give up GDP permanently, I'm thinking I will alternate them. I come away with a creamy high from this, which is nothing to complain about.”"

Dad really liked it and it reminded him of stuff he smoked when he was a kid in the 70's and early 80's. Good taste. It's a tightly packed nuggets and is brittle and sticky. Really dark colored weed. I loved it and would buy again. Down side is it does have a couch lock, but with a little umph, you can get it done.”"

TheeParrisHill,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cream/reviews/1223294,"“Approached this strain with caution due to me being primarily a fan of daytime upbeat Sativas but this right here vibed very well with me! I could even see using this for chill days. Overall smooth yet fully functional, clear headed and actually relatively up for having fun, watching a movie, reading etc. Tight purple nugs covered in crystals and a piney smell. Delightful.”"

Suffering from Insomnia, loss of appetite, muscle aches and a plethora of other health issues. This Magnificent strain has been a godsent. The look is Frosty witg hues of purple green and white. The flavor profile is that of Purple (If that makes sense) with a soft creaminess of ice cream. The exhale is smooth like Buttahhh. This baby packs a punch, even for experien...”"
