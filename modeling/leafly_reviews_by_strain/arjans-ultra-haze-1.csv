But the effect is worth to make a search for this strain. Uplifting and creative high, clear head and strange thoughts in one time, no couchlock. Great for mornings, before work and during the day.”"

And I had this positivly philosophical outlook on the world, and everything was pure poetry. It lasted about 2.5 - 3 hours. This was the most content and interesting strain I ever had...beautiful!”"

This is the kind of weed you wont find in dispensaries, unless you are at Greenhouse who made this strain....so if you can get your hands on it, don't miss the opportunity. This stuff is a celebration of life-not your typical skunk kush stoner weed. It's eclectic with a lot of character, meditative, inspiration...”"
