HazeyQuail,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qleaner/reviews/1136937,"“Awesone for pain. I got some good munchies on it(not out-of-control munchies). I was very content and relaxed. It also made me kind of aroused. These are only some of the great effects this strain gives. This is an all around great strain.”"
Jdies,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qleaner/reviews/1351498,"“Very strong head buzz. Not exactly energizing per se, but gave a nice "awake" feeling and a bit of a hyper, giggly feeling that comes and goes. Relatively focused high.”"
CH33SE,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qleaner/reviews/1319043,"“WOW! Holy head high! Qleaner comes on VERY STRONG, probably the strongest sativa cerebral high this old school vet has ever had! After Qleaner plows you with the overwhelming  cerebral high, it mellows out nicely into a cerebral/body high. This is a daytime medication, beginning with small amounts is probably a good idea. Unless you really want to go for a ride! 5 stars all day every day!!!”"
KristiW,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qleaner/reviews/1733453,"“Tip #1: Do not eat 2 thc cookies then smoke this strain.
Tip #2:  Less is more (for me with anxiety). I am giving this strain 5 stars even though it may not be the best for me.  I have used several times in different settings to confirm my opinion. Now that I can buy at a dispensary, I have been trying a variety of strains. I have anxiety/panic but also pain from spinal fusions and a few other medical issues. I do no...”"

MitchellandFinese,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qleaner/reviews/1531575,"“A dope smoke overall. I say that because you feel uplifted and energized, when you think it feels like you have more clarity. Perfect morning or midday smoke. Be mindful too much will cause couchlock.”"

prooney526,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qleaner/reviews/1152818,"“Nice, trusty sativa.  Uplifting and Stiulating effects in general.  Leaves a clear-headed, relatively functional, daytime use high.  Not a super heavy hitter on onset, but great for daytime use or durinig productive times.”"
asturwol,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qleaner/reviews/1700821,"“AMAZING! Easily a new favorite - super fast, super strong, SUPER HAPPY head high. “Distinctive munchies” will be a thing, you’ll also get the body tingles.. and likely be very aroused. Have a partner with you and you won’t be sorry.”"

MAmedicalmarijuana,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qleaner/reviews/1354824,"“The amazing lineage really comes out in these beautiful buds, fluffy, airy nugs with long leaves and a solid coating of trichomes with bright orange pistons. I've smelled many "citrusy" Sativa strains but no strain can compare to the punch of Sour Tropical and Chemical cleaner smell that this Strain delivers, very uplifting, euphoric, beware inexperienced smokers, too high of a dose of this Power Sativa will have you...”"
x25TappyEndings,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qleaner/reviews/1351519,"“Very quick hitting head high. Gave me tons of energy and I felt very at peace with the world. Music sounds amazing, I would definitely suggest throwing on some Grateful Dead for a good wake and bake sesh.”"
TheDankologist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/qleaner/reviews/1532826,"“I got this strain from Liberty Meds in Flint, MI. undoubtably one of the more complex hybrids in terms of overall appeal. Dense buds, smooth smoke, and great high. I want to make a big deal about the aroma from this bud. I got a mixture of fruity/Skittles the second I smelt the pound jar of it. Quite remarkable actually. I would recommend  anyone this strain!”"
