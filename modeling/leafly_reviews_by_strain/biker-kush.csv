Biker Kush has lightly Piney and slight lemony aroma and the flavor matches exactly. However I am not a fan of lemony flavors, but I will explain why I love this strain and it's not the taste....”"

I got a high end gram of this as gratis, and I did like the smell (the reason I chose it) and looked up the parentage/info on Leafly before consumption. It’s a combo of things I haven’t tried so, a bonus. I took a micro dose, and I was very satisfied with the flavor, and medical attributes.

wahlgrennathan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biker-kush/reviews/1615762,"“LOVE this strain! It has a nice taste that isn’t too hard on the lungs. All the stress, worries, and troubles melt away and you’re left feeling like you are floating through life on a cloud. The first few times I smoked it, I had the giggles for 30 minute straight. The only downside is that it isn’t a super strong strain. The high usually wears off in about an hour. But then it’s awesome to pack another bowl and get ...”"

MeliMed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biker-kush/reviews/1661606,"“Biker kush...definitely a good one!!! Very good sedative...really relaxes you & while it relaxes you enjoy the great flavor. It tastes like berry-ish, lemony, really kushy & it was awesome =D”"
