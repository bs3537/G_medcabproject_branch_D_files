Creative, focused, and stressfree is the best way to describe this strain.  Simply put: with this strain I know I am in an anxious situation, I just can't get anxious about it.  Great medication for daytime/work/productive day.”"

musicwizard,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-jack/reviews/1383315,"“I have mixed feelings about this strain. For me, it was a major creeper, so the first time I tried it I had a little too much and had a minor freak out. Not a paranoia freak-out, more of an anti-social kinda thing. The next few times were a lot better. It makes everything pop a little louder. Colors are more vibrant, every thought is an epiphany, and everything has a lot more emotional intensity. Very float-y. I also...”"

I'd definitely get again but would take straight up Jack Herer over this if given the choice.”"
