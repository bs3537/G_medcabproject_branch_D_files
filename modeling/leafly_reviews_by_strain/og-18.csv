OG #18

I felt relaxed through the day and my pain was dampened enough that I managed to get a few chores done.  I was pretty chatty on the phone with people and felt a little "outside of myself" during the day (re-hit about 4 hours after 1st use, and again...”"

very strong acting strain in both cerebral and body effects.

Quashed my nausea and boosted my appetite. Very effective on my pain, bringing the level down to 3-4/10. Worked pretty well on my chronic insomnia as well. A great go-to, multi-purpose herb. Has to be added to my Top 3 for pain relief.”"

This "OG 18" is a very intense version of its namesake, with one distinct difference, it lasts up to 4 hours per dosage.  Too much of this, and you will get couchlock, bad.  Great for insomnia too.  Start slow on your dosages, and you can get things done around the house with good pain relief.  This is not someth...”"

And I fell asleep again fast , which is unusual, & he slept all night without waking, which is v. rare. Woke up extremely rested & calm. Do this when you reall...”"

OG #18, if you have tried other OG's (a.k.a. Ocean Grown) in similar, it has a more sour pungency over the traditional KUSH scent most associate to the strain. True OG has a hindu smell, where 'Private Reserve' expresses a cheesier edge in its terpenes. Beautiful plant when aged at 9weeks mature flowering, nice dense bud, mid li...”"

Real stanky and loud earth scent, taste's more sour than it smells. It tends to burn a bit hot like most og's but this one will expand ur lungs and make u tear up in the best way possible.”"

Cresco’s OG 18, aka Private Reserve, is an enjoyable, heavy Indica that goes down light and smooth.
