If you had a really bad or traumatic experience this will send you on a different mindset. This one made me think of sail boats, which is odd cause I live in a desert. Definitely a night time indica. Be ready to be that silent person! lol”"

MessiahRice,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rare-darkness/reviews/1300216,"“Very light hitting -
Berry flavor -
Slight tickle in back of throat after exhale -
Almost musky tasting -

Comes off as lower grade -
Would not pay more that 8/g -
Chest high -
Relaxing -
Not the most noticeable high”"

bgoddess78,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rare-darkness/reviews/1154848,"“I'm not sure if it is hybrid because that is not listed on the package in which it came.  Actually, I don't think I can give an honest review on this strain because I did not vaporize it alone.  I mixed it with Alien OG and Chemdog 4.”"
