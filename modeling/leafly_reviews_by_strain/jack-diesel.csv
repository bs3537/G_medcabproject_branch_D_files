Jack Diesel
=============
TheWovenWeb,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-diesel/reviews/1341786,"“Gives a really nice uplifting effect that is somewhat euphoric and creative, but still somehow mellow. It smells of pungent sweetness, and tastes sweet like candy as well. Good morning strain, even better daytime strain. Great nausea relief and hunger inducer. It is great for stress, I don't feel any bit of anxiety with this strain which is surprising to me. This might be one of my favorite sativas ever. The effects ...”"
griff440,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-diesel/reviews/1415423,"“Very uplifted, euphoric high. Good daytime strain, and good for depression.”"
Ankush22,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-diesel/reviews/1354496,"“An Amazing Sativa that is full of flavor which has a haze type of taste. Its parent plant is the beast of a sativa Jack Herer and another Diesel making this the best of both. Great uplifting energetic high delivered from an excellent Sativa!”"
Amrit.J,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-diesel/reviews/1354497,"“Definitely an intense head high. It keeps you awake and your eyes wide open.”"
HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-diesel/reviews/1411927,"“This stuff is almost overkill. I said, almost...Jack Diesel is a  serious sativa lover's dream strain. Very airy mental stimulation, pleasant energy increase, and very subtle fading as it wears off. I could smoke this all day, it's that clean of a buzz. Later in the day I experienced a body buzz, but I think the sandman was creeping in by then. Wonderfully fluffy, sweet, and dark green flower is what I've seen from J...”"
DarkwolfsBlade89,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-diesel/reviews/1326873,"“A great Sativa buzz for the morning or afternoon Jack Diesel will leave you Happy, Hungry, Uplifted, Energetic, Relaxed, and Focused with alittle cotton mouth. Great for depression, stress, neasea, adhd, or anxiety. A Every Diesely, Earthy, with a Citrus finish flavor testing at 31.1 from Leef and is very strong for a Sativa.”"
AnalysisParalysis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-diesel/reviews/1242085,"“Induces creative, wakeful relaxation and increases appetite. Body high with no couch lock and mental high with no anxiety. Impairs fine motor skills, e.g. handwriting. Recommended if you'd like to enjoy your lunch more and/or get going on a creative project.

The sample I tried came from Stoney Only in Clackamas. HIGH-ly recommended!”"

Through my Arizer Solo vaporizer ground medium, this blend tastes mostly fruity and light followed by a pleasantly mild diesel taste. Initially it produces a strong, clean head high inviting creativity and thought. Later you will be left feeling good, happy and ready for your day! Hats off to TCC in Mesa for carrying this (and many other) killer s...”"

Make you feel happy and relaxed and after some time you feel the energy and ready to do things.    Pretty recommendable to use since early morning to afternoon, some time at night will give you to much energy if you want to sleep soon.”"

wearebestfwends,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-diesel/reviews/1238811,"“This long lasting strain affected me differently than what most people are reporting. It makes me very relaxed and calm with couchlock. It feels more like an indica than a sativa or at least an indica dominate hybrid. Either way, this strain is fantastic.”"
