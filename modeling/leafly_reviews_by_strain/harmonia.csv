MartineAiyana,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1355331,"“I love Gumbi for the physically relaxing and mentally 
uplifting vibe with mild psychoactive effects. Tension & stress melt away, while I can still be productive and clear mentally. I tend to be a lightweight and this strain is perfect for me.”"
JustMeHere,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1355329,"“I enjoyed this strain the first two times. Took all my pain away with no high. Only needed one of two hits.  Exactly what I was looking for. However, the third and fourth time has made me quite dizzy. The dizziness is lasting a few days coming in waves and worst when laying down.  Not sure I will use this strain again due to this symptom. Hope the dizziness goes away soon.”"
GreenPie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1353831,"“Update:
Second allergy season Gumbi has provided relief better than any anti-histamine (or Singular, which gave me really bad side effects). 

CBD strains in general are having this effect on me. Gumbi is my preferred CBD strain though because I find it to be the most chillaxed indica CBD strain. 

So when you're sneezing and wheezing from allergies (if you are in Colorado, its literally been snowing Dandelion pollen...”"
GreenPie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1354391,"“This was the first strain I ever smoked (legally that is), in CO2 oil form. Bought it from the Farm. Back then, as a noob I wanted something smooth and gentle. I figured a high CBD strain would work. It did. Excellent INTRO TO MMJ 101 Strain. No paranoia. Found out Gumbi works for allergies as I took it during allergy season. It destroyed allergies and got me feeling pretty nice. Great body high. Go CBD and THC!!!”"
PanConTable,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1361788,"“I absolutely love the 1:1 CBD:THC balance of this "harmonious" strain. As a father, husband, and business executive, I need to be functional all the time, even during my down time/family time. This strain relaxes my mind, soothes my body and provides the light relief I like to indulge in, on occasion. As a natural products consumer, I also like that The Farm does not spray any of their flower, so I can feel confident...”"
unclegingi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1354390,"“This strain has a very nice smooth hit that taste very sweet . The high that I received from this gumbi was VERY fast to my body and made me feel super relaxed and slightly euphoric. My shoulder pain went away and i was immediately relaxed .”"
LadyAntimony,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1354387,"“I love the pain relief I get from it. Very high on my list.”"
Hen3ry,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1354388,"“Euphoric equivalent to a can of beer(or two). Low THC, cannabinol high.”"
2DankFrank,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1354389,"“Got this one from The Farm in Boulder. 

I paid $14 for a gram ($17 w/tax). 

Nothing special, really. I felt relaxed and only mildly buzzed after 10 or so hits. There was a mild head buzz and zero anxiety. 

This would be a nice comedown strain for those who accidentally got too high on other strains, and for salads for those who want a mellower high than high thc strains provide. 

In other words, far more medicina...”"

Precariouslee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1723928,"“My wife and I had totally different reactions. I melted into the couch and was content to do absolutely nothing for three hours. My wife, on the other hand, was as relaxed as if she had a couple of drinks and was able to cook dinner (without any help from me 😉)”"
TheFarm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1355065,"“Great for pain relief, upset stomachs, and anxiety. Perfect THC:CBD ratio.”"
mrmilehighguy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1355076,"“Amazing strain! The Farm in Boulder has the best cut!”"
PanConTable,https://www.leafly.com/indica/harmonia/reviews/1585725,"“It's a great starter strain with a generous dose of CBD and a lower amount of THC. It's relaxing and you can function well due to its low THC content. I like the IndigoPro version I got at The Farm 'cause I can regulate the amount I draw with each pull of the vaporizer. Would highly recommend this for beginner cannabis users and for those looking for a healthy serving of CBD.”"
