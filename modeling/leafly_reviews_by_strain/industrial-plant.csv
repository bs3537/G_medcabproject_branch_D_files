yogiova,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/industrial-plant/reviews/1316161,"“this strain is the right compromise between big crops, easy growing, good taste and strong buzz. outdoors can take purple or red colours.

Bart8888,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/industrial-plant/reviews/1744193,"“Pretty good strain. Smells like bubblegum.
