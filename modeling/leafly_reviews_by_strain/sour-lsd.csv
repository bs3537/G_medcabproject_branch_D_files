First off it looks really nice it's a different color than most bud a bright emerald green, fire orange hairs, dense and covered with a healthy coating of crystals. The smell is very citrus and it tastes alot like Dutch Treat, a mild citrus flavor. It's deffinetly a head high with lots of energy and focus for me this is a smoke all day strain from wake up till I'm ready for bed at ni...”"

I did eventually find Chemmy Jones, so I can confirm the budtender's suggestion that they are similar. Both are good for staying active and alert while feeling totally relaxed in the process. Sour LSD distinguishes itself by offering up a slight colourful vibrancy reminiscent of Lavender. 

Also Leafly indicated that Sour LSD is good for e...”"

I can see this being one of my favorites I like it more than sour d. I did not notice much as far as psycoactive effects, there was no paranoia. i love taking a rip of this to start off a great day”"

StellarStoner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-lsd/reviews/1259822,"“This is boldly flavorful and smelly. These were sticky and stinky  fluffy fat green flowers with a nice crystal coating. It looks and smells amazing. When I smoked this it produced an energized friendly high with a smile.
Now this is my kind of medicine top shelf  that also contains love energy.
I will definitely buy more of this strain Lambsbread X Sour Diesel from the guild dispensary in Eugene Oregon.”"

mindlesstoner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-lsd/reviews/1409948,"“Incredible strain. I recommend it for celebratory use. I couldn't stop laughing at the dumbest thing like my breathe or my feet. After aimlessly walking around the same few streets a few times I suddenly noticed a double railed banister and I ran so fast to the top and slid down: I did this for a solid 45 minutes. I smoked this on a Friday after a long week of school and many hard tests. I was in a great mood to be d...”"

OaklandCountyCaregiver,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-lsd/reviews/1409946,"“This is such a good smoke and vape! I prefer to vape it because it has such a clean and fresh flavor, which comes through purely in the vape. It's great to smoke as well, either pipe or rolled. I picked some up at Sky High and it rocks!”"

patmgallagher,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-lsd/reviews/1409953,"“decent head high, that's about it. feels purely sativa, but not like an amazing one. harsh and tastes kind of bad. could be alright for a wake and bake.”"

I like that I can stay awake and enjoy it, but after a while it brings on a pleasant sleepy feeling. Will be buying this again.”"

Enjoy all varieties I've tried. Except for Sour LSD. Wow. I had read about the auditory effects, but assumed they would be positive in nature. Wrong. I got the described combo body/head high as expected, but also suffered some disagreeable auditory effects. Not like what you might be expecting, like music sounds better or...”"
JacobbTG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-lsd/reviews/1409945,"“Despite the over the top name, this is a strain that I didn't find to have much in the way of psychoactive effects, let alone any "heavier" effects such as super munchies or sounds becoming more prominent in music and television. Spicy snd slightly bitter, this is a strain that packs quite a little body high punch, albeit a hastier one than I would have liked. Sour Diesel or Green Crack would be better alternatives t...”"
