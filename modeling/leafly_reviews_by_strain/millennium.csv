GreenCaptin87,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/millennium/reviews/1633540,"“I smoked this and was gonna go on a hike. Made it too the recliner and woke up 4 hours later...:a deep indica too say the least lol. Night time use for me but all around very pleasant”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/millennium/reviews/1731812,"“I never even heard of this strain. It is a strange and confusing high. One minute I was glued to the furniture then suddenly there were random bursts of energy. I did laugh a lot but the sativa and indica seem to compete constantly for your attention. This one was all over the place but I'd do it again.”"
