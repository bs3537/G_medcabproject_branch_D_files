The taste is phenomenally OG, very piney and heavy. It's what a lot of connoisseurs are looking for in their flowers. Cresco still has a bit of work to do on their curation process.

You definitely feel relaxed, uplifted, happy, and euphoric all at the same time. I got the feeling that I was hovering right over my own body as I was laying down.
