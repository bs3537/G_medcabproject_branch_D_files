Eric420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/supernova/reviews/1377978,"“Supernova is a fire sativa dominant good for a mid day smoke or if you have a heavy tolerance this would be a perfect wake n bake strain it has a nice Citrusy  tropical aroma but it tastes spicy it kind of reminds me of Super Lemon Haze because it smells sweet and  zesty but the flavor has a nice spicy Haze thing going on with it , the effects come on pretty much right away with a nice uplifting buzz but its also cal...”"

canuck68,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/supernova/reviews/1343889,"“Excellent evening strain for pain and PTSD symptoms. I had the opportunity to try a variety from Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds (dot com), and wow - talk about strong! This stuff is the strongest pain medication I've tried (within the cannabis realm). It's not for daytime use as it will knock you on your ass. I did notice it made my eyes a little dryer than most, but otherwise an excellent strain!”"

flipndip187,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/supernova/reviews/1593320,"“i got a half zip of this from my boy. who ever grew it didnt trim any of the littlenleaves on the bud, making it look kinda trashy at 1st. but the smell is outrageous. super pungent citrusy sweet smell and the flavor was the same but slightly mosre harsh, most like from all the little leaves i diddnt feel like picking off. the high is very nice, definetly a solid mid day strain. PS trim your freakin bud you bums.”"

nauseousmoth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/supernova/reviews/1729519,"“this strain is AMAZING. definitely one of my favourites. it tastes amazing, and smokes quite nicely. it gives a great body-high, perfect for chilling and playing games, watching movies, etc; but it’s ESPECIALLY amazing for listening to music. i’ve found it almost makes me more analytical, as if every word in every song has some sort of impossibly deep meaning. the only thing i’d change if i could was the headhigh- it...”"

MoTokez,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/supernova/reviews/1378327,"“Have you ever bought some nugs so frosty that they just kief up your grinder? That's what this strain is all about, but...the kick was nowhere near what I thought it would be. It was nice, but I thought I'd get a little more out of it, especially for being 29% THC! Looks like numbers aren't everything! Then again, maybe I expected too much. The batch I had mostly consisted of popcorn nugs that looked absolutely beaut...”"
