Large, medium-dense flower, very purple in color. the aroma is very welcoming, and is the high itself. I have found dreamer's glass to be an extremely well-balanced strain. Initial feeling leans heavily towards sativa without being too racy. An alert, happy high follows, and after about 15 minutes the indica properties kick in. I could feel the high ...”"

This is an accidental duplicate of my previous Dreamers Glass review.”"
