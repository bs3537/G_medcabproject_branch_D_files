Great buzz, I became quite talkative and energetic. Gave me some wicked cottonmouth and made me just a little bit hungry, not too strong a case of the munchies, though. I also gained quite a bit of energy as well.”"

I vaped at 420F and the vapor was so thick I thought I was gonna get everyone within 100 feet of me stoned also. I watched Terminator Genesis and loved the special effects. Then I got brave and ate a habanero pepper for some reason and I'm still paying for it the day after. Moral of the story...enjoy this strain and stay away from habanero peppers =)”"

I didn't get sleepy, but it did make me comfortable enough to want to sleep.  I can still use this during the day and be ok.  This had wonderful flavors of fruit, sweet pine, tropical fruits, but a slight pungent aftertaste.  I had a bowl to myself and I was gooooood!!  This melted away severe nerve pain, moderate tendon pain, and moderate muscle pain. ...”"
