SmokerTokerBlaze420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/violator-kush/reviews/1395577,"“Super strong, but maybe a bit too strong its hard to talk normal and focus on anything. Definitely something to use at home only. Thoughts are clear but its hard to do anything with them. poor motor skills. Super spicy smell, like sniffing pepper almost stings the nose.

Was quite strong - 4 hits and I was ready for bed. Once in bed, I felt more or a body buzz. I was super relaxed and couldn't feel much.
