s4kicks,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1417089,"“I am absolutely not one to leave reviews unless I come across a product or service that is exceptionally good or bad, but this occurs maybe once or twice a year.  I have been a subscriber to Leafly for about a year and have never left a review in spite of the fact that I have tried over 40 strains over the last couple of years from several different LP's.  Several patients that I know as well as my doctor recommended...”"

Stealthbomber34,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1359142,"“I have nightmares, night sweats etc and have neither on this. 4-6 hours of deep sleep followed by a few hours of light lazy sleep. Takes awhile to kick in, but when it does, buckle up!”"
11thThesis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1359432,"“So I finally tried my Licensed Producer's pricey flagship strain.

A few thoughts:

1) It is advertised as an indica, but it has a strong haze undertone, in its bud structure, and in the cerebral quality to its otherwise sedating buzz. I would speculate, thus, while the genetics are top secret, that this is a Siliver Haze crossed with either Godbud or G-13 cross. Likely G-13 in terms of the buzz.
2) It is very strong...”"

anxiety...SNAP
27%THC 
This is the best Medical strain EVER!

I would also recommend for those who have been enjoying cannabis for a while and need that extra kick in your butt!

Go slow and enjoy🙏”"
Sethalos,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1410662,"“As a Veteran suffering from PTSD, I highly recommend this strain. It is an exceptionally good strain for depression/anxiety, as well helping with sleep. It doesn't fog brain as much as others yet I feel happy and relaxed. I have tried many different strains over the past few years, and this one has become my daily standard. Amazingly good.”"
delta9oracle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1544743,"“Having had the pleasure of watching this strain grow, I have learned a tremendous amount about Eran Almog. It has educated and truly refined my understanding of medicinally engineered (or very specifically selected and bred) cannabis vs. strains tailored for recreational use. No question that this strain indeed hits all the right notes for insomnia, inflammation, and particularly pain related ailments- and no doubt i...”"

D.C.,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1342841,"“Very nice! This strain has a very calming, feel good, mentally relaxing, sedative, yet clear headed effect. Chronic pain eases away very nicely with this strain, also a bit of an aphrodisiac.  This strain would also be good for anxiety , stress,  PTSD.”"
OtterFodder,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1410658,"“A rare breed in both accessibility and potency, I can personally attest to having received THC/THCa content of 27.34%, and that was a crumble(slightly less expensive) which tends run lower. 
Personally, I found it an uplifting high that made me want to chat with friends, during which everything was hysterically funny. 
Can't give it the full 5 because like everyone else who's tried it, I payed too much, but it's defi...”"

BranzFlakes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1334149,"“i usually vape this bud before i head to sleep. i normally toss and turn and stay up all night being unable to sleep. after getting this i sleep like a baby. it helps so much but the price from my LP is ridiculous. but id buy it again cause it helps so much”"

flexdug17,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1343691,"“good strain but by the buds, i dont think its a pure indica , 28% thc good high but its not the best i ever taste”"
AndreaN,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1413516,"“Although this bud was kinda overly dry, bought at Canopi in Vegas . It had a great taste , and did the job at helping me fall asleep 😴 and sleep soundly for several hours . I would like to try a fresh batch 😄”"
hotdiggitydank,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1465916,"“This  is a very mellow and dissocative type of strain. I like to tune in on this one after the work day. Great for doing it but I think  a little bit of sleep after doing it is in order with this strain.”"
SophistMonk,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1248998,"“Very pleasant taste and smell. Great relaxing high, good for bodily pain without cloudy head. I like to smoke it before bed.”"
WhiteGyrfalcon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1376478,"“Eran Almog is an amazing medicine for those troubled by sleeping or neurological disorders, inter-muscular pain and for those who desire a high degree of mental clarity while deeply relaxed.  There is good reason to celebrate this strain and to maintain the integrity of its genetics that are unlike any other Indica offering I have tried over four decades.  Thank you for getting it right Medreleaf!”"
Katenglish09,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1673725,"“So here comes some TMI, but I feel that for medical purposes its important I say it. I have awful periods to the point where I am extremely anemic. To put the cherry on top of this situation I take birth control pills that make me vomit. This strain when I smoke it completely stops my nausea and for some reason gives me resilience toward my anemia (I literally don't feel anemic anymore..until it wears off 6-10hrs). O...”"
aleisterlavey,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1410656,"“Got this strain from Canopi and it's 19% instead of 28% as advertised. It did absolutely nothing, literally nothing. Two raw cones. 1 1/4 generously packed and nothing. It was almost like smoking really bad tobacco and some gas station kratom. Only that would have done more. Don't buy this crap your paying for the package. It doesn't work. If you do buy this garbage get one gram and try it, otherwise your wasting you...”"

Enzocosta86,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eran-almog/reviews/1363597,"“was not impressed with this strain. it is not better then the other death Bubba or white rhino but costs so much from the LP. 5 grams after delivery and taxes is over 100$. it is mediocre unfortunately.”"
