This one made me stumble a bit at the end of the night. Very effective at pain relief, calming anxiety and combating those sleepless nights..”"

Sweet dreams abound tonight with merlot, a heavy indica which, to those who like to overindulge, will be left feeling a little bit wine drunk along with your sleepy stoned... No hangover though. Thirty nine stars, USA.”"

Oddly enough, I could really smell the scent of butter through anything else. Would definitely recommend to anyone with chronic pain, or anyone who just needs to unwind at the end of a stressful day.”"
