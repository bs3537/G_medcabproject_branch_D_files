nickrazza,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-limeade/reviews/1152455,"“Review is for 'Limeaid'
but solid indica dominant hybrid strain with unknown genetics 
(chosen to be kept secret by the growers)
Large, dense cone buds boast highly of this indica dom medicine,
giving a subtle ease behind the eyes but applying much relief to the shoulders/back/neck region. 
Leaving you wanting to stretch out, get all cozy and watch a movie!”"

The cherry limeade is amazing as a strain and what a way to complement its unique taste by producing an amazing shatter. Super high in THC and feels like glass when you go to scrape a dab up, but it's awesome. John provided me oil that was the perfect strain for my Crohn's  and there are zero residual solvents left over at all. John offers the pu...”"

earlofamerica,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-limeade/reviews/1325613,"“I'm smoking a pre-roll of this right now. It definitely hits like a sativa. It brings more in the way of happiness and euphoria than a rush of energy, the way some true sativas do. I would highly recommend this strain if I had the blues or just to chill with some friends early in the evening. I'd even give this strain another half a star, if I could but I can't bring myself to say it's as good as my very favorite str...”"

g0d0fm15ch13f,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-limeade/reviews/1200737,"“Possibly my favorite strain. 

Cherry limeade's is one of the most uplifting highs I have ever had. It's effects are noticeable pretty quickly and they last for a while. In small doses this is a great wake n bake however in larger doses you are almost certain to get uncontrollable laughter. I spent almost an hour with a buddy rolling around on the ground yelling at his Xbox. It was fun.”"

lagoose,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-limeade/reviews/1544822,"“Surprising strain. Sweet but grassy which kinda resembles the tartness you would expect from cherries. Very refreshing.”"
Chikichee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-limeade/reviews/1756824,"“My whole body is a mess and this helps make so many things easier! Adds just enough of a kick to my Adderall  to help me focus without affecting my heart, counteracts my mood swings and nausea during my period so I can eat and function, and helps me relax so I can chill with friends without my depression or anxiety getting in the way. It can be a bit overwhelming when you first try it, but it's 100% worth it to build...”"
OGBONEZ21,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-limeade/reviews/1215342,"“Very sweet and tart at the same time. Definitely lives up to the name. Overall it hits the spot, equally heady and body. Not overbearing, decent smoke.”"

*It's Cherry Pie x Black Lime Reserve... 




I have found it to a fairly balanced, slightly indica feel. Muscle relaxing, stress eliminating, leading to sedative type sleep is how I felt.

NicholasRichards,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-limeade/reviews/1256608,"“The smell of this strain is amazing. It's so unique with a mix of sour, that is very lime like and sweet that is more of a candy cherry. The buz is very tingly but in a warm bath sort of way. I felt the taste was a bit lacking compared to the smell. (that was a bit of a let down) Also the buds were a bit stemy. Smoked well though. Most Def worth the $9 I paid for it.”"

fishfold,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-limeade/reviews/1190174,"“this is definatly my new favorite. such an amazingly sweet smell and taste. I also noticed the taste lingered in the back of my throat for a while after I was done which was very pleasant. The high made me want to go for a jog but also was very relaxing. 10/10 in my book.”"
bandoola,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-limeade/reviews/1448726,"“I tried as an oil and it's fun. The taste is very flavorful, almost too sweet for my pallet, but it's a fun puff. The high THC count was quickly potent and I feel a wave of chill. I feel an stimulated onset of hunger even though I ate a good meal earlier. Overall, a solid choice as a heavy hitting oil.”"
drZoidberg420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-limeade/reviews/1266549,"“This is my all time favorite strain!!!  It may also go by Cherry Limes or Cherry Lime Rickey.  The buds are not generally big nugs and may at times seem a little larfy, but don't let that fool you.... that moment when the aroma hits your olfactory senses is a whole other experience.  The aroma itself will incite comments from even the most experienced of consumers.  I 'highly' recommend this strain!!!”"
