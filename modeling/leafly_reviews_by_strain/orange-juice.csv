Krystallization,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-juice/reviews/1365491,"“Tastes and smells exactly like Orange Juice. Great way to wake up in the morning right before breakfast.”"
barlow8,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-juice/reviews/1337598,"“Reminds me of a freshly picked tangerine. A sweet and earthy flower. This is smooth on the mind and most kind to the body. Feels like a good day time bud, but it also has made me feel very relaxed. So I could see the benefit of an evening toke and perhaps relief from insomnia.”"

JJ4,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-juice/reviews/1590528,"“Great uplifting and great strain to do when times get tough or you just need to get away from reality and be in your own world, but it does dry out your eyes and mouth but that's nothing a Gatorade and eye drops can't fix.”"
jzizi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-juice/reviews/1216741,"“I really didn't expect much out of this strain, but actually I was blown away. Reason being because of the Orange juice sweet taste and Orange buds. it made me have a nice head buzz with a relaxed body, definitely good if you have a loss of appetite!”"

nickk732,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-juice/reviews/1279556,"“I found this slightly underwhelming. I was excited about trying it having heard how unique the taste was, but the orange flavour which came out of my volcano was weak and the vapour thin. The flowers looked decent, smell was meh.

High was an average indica high, didn't last very long and couldn't help put me to sleep.

I would probably not buy this again.”"
JayLew,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-juice/reviews/1204254,"“very good strain. my favorite "orange strain". the smell is very sweet with a suttle smell of orange peels. i expected it to have a more citrus like aroma to it, but the name Orange Juice fits it just right. i would recommend the strain to any consumer that enjoys distinctive buds.”"
