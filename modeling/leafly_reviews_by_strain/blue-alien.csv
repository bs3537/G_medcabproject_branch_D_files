I smoke several times a week and this strain has me on my ass. It has a very strong cerebral high and definitely worth the $11 cost”"
petethekoala,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-alien/reviews/1413387,"“Blue Alien is a very potent strain. It strike you very early after vaping it. The euphoria is quite strong but generally it falls in a more dreamy or cinematic state if you're near bed time. It can be good for a cinema evening or as a sleeping aid. It kills pain and calm stress in a blunt efficient way. The smoke can be quite strong even with a vaporizer. The taste is quite subtle and not very impressive even if you ...”"

Awesome combo.”"
Reductioabsurdum,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-alien/reviews/1381886,"“If you're looking to relax or used before bed, this strain gets you going in that direction. The high THC count carries with it some force that can't be ignored. Calm and peaceful body high. It's probably got some couch lock, however it blends with it such a mellow cerebral high, that a relaxing walk isn't unthinkable. Brings some water though. Cognition will rely more heavily on intuition, so let the muscle memory d...”"

kwilhelm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-alien/reviews/1266942,"“I haven't smoked bud in 25 years, and my New Years resolution was to smoke weed again this year. I went to Euphorium and purchased the Ceres brand. 24.9% THC/0.17% CBD. I took 2 tokes not knowing how I was going to react to the high. It was a clean high, it made me happy and focused and enjoying the high. Even tho I didn't get massively baked, which I purposely avoided, It was wonderful.”"

It gives an almost Sativa head high early in with a light session. As the session progresses you start to get the more noticeable Indica body thumping and couch lock. Strong sense of munchies although you never lose the  clarity of strong Sativa.

Fantastic flavour, fantastic high, and fantastic pain management with a great sleep finish.

chebachavez,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-alien/reviews/1256158,"“Purchased this strain at my favorite shop in Denver. The strain is a decent indica, not really a heavy hitter indica so I would look else where if you wanted something heavier. The bud structure is amazing! Very dense nugs giving off a seer berry type fragrance. I would give the flavor 9/10 and the high and medicinal properties a 6/10”"
Flapeth,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-alien/reviews/1440081,"“I've smoked weed for almost 18 years, this is an instant favorite. It is mellow and clean, the smoke flavor is light and subtle like others have said. It's maybe too strong for paranoid people or if it's your first time. For a veteran toker though this is a very relaxing experience. Drink water, stay hydrated, eat healthy foods. Enjoy 10/10”"

I only smoke recreationally to enhance sexy times with dh and this makes things more intense, in a truly fabulous way, than other strains I've tried.  Tastes good due to the blueberry parentage, smokier than most with a vape, and is definitely a buzzing body high that makes everything feel good.

From a local farm named Blue Rock...my best guess anyway) a variation of Blue Alien, called Alien Blue Dot. Definitely blueberries then quickly earth, slight dirt aftertaste and overall very very dry and somewhat disappointing. Taste woes aside, the freight train body high is nothing short of magical. Might have to revisit this goofy turd of a strain. Might not.”"
