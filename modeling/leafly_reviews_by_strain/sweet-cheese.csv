Dimedude,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-cheese/reviews/1388069,"“This was one of the stinkiest buds I've ever tried.  I really can't emphasize it enough that this is one smelly strain of weed.  But it is a nice smell.
Anyway, this could  probably help with sleep problems as when I smoked it at night, I literally just had to go to bed after.  And I'm a stay up late kind of guy.  Nice taste, nice high, pain and stress relief, what more can I say?”"
LongLeafBlunts,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-cheese/reviews/1360193,"“Like its name, Sweet Cheese has the aromas of a mild cheese with sweet undertones of fruits and berries with a hint of sweet melon.  This bud breaks up easy and is nicely compact.  perfect for DAYTIME smoke to start your day or energize you mid day for an extra booster of CREATIVITY, MOTIVATION and INSPIRATION.  Great for those seeking productivity away from ANXIETY and DEPRESSION. If you find this bud stock up, it'...”"
arnoski,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-cheese/reviews/1323122,"“Pretty pleasant and heavy on the intoxicant effect. Great if you're looking to relax and enjoy yourself while counteracting depression. 

Not so hot if you need to function, though. I vaporized a small bowl, and found that I was losing track of the things I was trying to get done. In fact, trying to write this review took me a little bit because I kept forgetting that I was trying to open Leafly on my phone.”"
ben_marko,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-cheese/reviews/1388070,"“This didn't smell like Cheese or any of the "Sweet" strains I've tried.  Just smelled vaguely diesel-ish, but I smoke a lot of Diesel so there's that.  I had not smoked anything for four hours before trying this.

Buds were light green and soft, spongy, and slightly crunchy.  Ground up ok, nice and gooey, into the bowl.

Thick smoke, a bit like paint thinner(!) at the start, but my pipe is wood and OLD (an old ga...”"

AasonOrr,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-cheese/reviews/1141891,"“I have sampled better brands and blends since weed was legalized in WA State, but I have also sampled worse. 

The high is pleasant, neither gentle nor debilitating, but rather a nice hybrid of relaxation and a mild creative, euphoria. It's a very good herb to aid your creative writing, drawing or painting. 

The weed also came packaged in a handy plastic tube (similar to the old 35mm film canisters we all used back ...”"

I like the density and crystally-ness of the buds.  Gives a good heady high that I enjoy.  Got this with some NYC Diesel and I liked them both.  This one is much fainter in smell than the Diesel that is for sure”"

The  smell was very subtle spicy and slightly musky. The Flavor upon smoking was very nice earthy, musky, sweet long lasting cheesy flavor.  I give the flavor a 7/10.  The smell is about a 3.5/10  The high is a 9/10.  Nice uplifting high calm and enjoyable.”"

Stinky stinky stinky, but I love it!”"
mizerychick,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-cheese/reviews/1160959,"“Love the mellow body buzz of Sweet Cheese.  Very relaxing with a little pain relief, good for light chores or just settling in for the night. Pungent but I enjoy the burning aroma, almost like sweet bbq. Had a small amount of munchie cravings but not too bad. Received from VIP - East in Henderson, NV, a great medical marijuana dispensary.”"

For those purposes, this strain was a too heavy. More than one hit made me really sleepy. 
But I expected this going in, so I blended it with SuperJack, (2/3 SuperJack, 1/3 Sweet Cheese) which offset the high-strung anxiety that SuperJack brought to the game. 


At night I reeeeeally enjoyed Sweet Cheese on it’s own...”"
Lunar_Lesbian,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sweet-cheese/reviews/1607320,"“This strain is the definition of "okay weed."  It tastes okay (I don't like cheese strains, I may be biased), but the high is pretty nice.  It leaves you relaxed, uplifted, and ready to take on any daily task.  Makes you very productive, but the high doesn't last super long.  I like this strain a lot, but compared to other sativas it's not as potent.”"

Nice cerebral, creative high, physically relaxing but not couch-locking. Getting it in an oil cartridge negates the cheesy smell, and the vapor is faintly sweet if you let it linger in your mouth.”"
