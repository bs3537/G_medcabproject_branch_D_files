HideousKinky,https://www.leafly.com/indica/illuminati-og/reviews/1359235,"“This stuff is really good, but it did not, as advertised, "knock me out." Instead, I got some awesome psychoactive effects that made me want to smoke more, but left me hella hungover the next day. I think I'm too much of a newbie for this powerfully potent weedizzle.”"

theholographicwolf,https://www.leafly.com/indica/illuminati-og/reviews/1555694,"“This is one of my favorite strains right now. As soon as I smoke it, I become so motivated, calm, intelligent (I write a lot on this one), and happy. I tend to smoke alone because I get major social anxiety, but this strain doesn’t make me anxious one bit. I do homework really well on it, and I game like a beast. Illuminati just makes me so happy, and it’s truly better than any antidepressant 🙏🏽”"

bbates024,https://www.leafly.com/indica/illuminati-og/reviews/1359238,"“So I had my first chance to sample this herb today. I really liked it. Illuminati gave me the body buzz of an indica with a light head high. I had a good burst of energy in the beginning but after about four hours I felt a little drowsy. I guess that's when you should smoke more, right?

I'd give it a try. Mine was only 8.5 THC and it was a great feeling buzz, and worked to take away my back and ankle pain.”"
jabbathepot,https://www.leafly.com/indica/illuminati-og/reviews/1311231,"“Good for sleeping, decent control for restless legs but not great. They were a little tingly, which isn't something an RLS sufferer wants! Something about it just opens the mind, music sounds amazing, and really large, abstract concepts can be thought about without seeming overwhelming.”"
i2Saucy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/illuminati-og/reviews/1392157,"“This strain left me slummmp god status! Super melty from the head down! One of my favorite bedtime strains for sure!”"
LukeSkylark,https://www.leafly.com/indica/illuminati-og/reviews/1499741,"“Vaped this OG, it's my #1 go to right now, whenever 3C has it. Totally mellows out the thought process. Turns thoughts into ideas, Resolves stress. Makes for great conversations. Eases the body into a relaxed state & from there a I can settle in for some perfect zzzzzzz.”"
