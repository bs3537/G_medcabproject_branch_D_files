sunshinegrrl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramelicious/reviews/1326983,"“This strain is fairly easy to grow. Sometimes takes a while to root, even with ideal conditions, but takes right off once it finds it's feet. Not an overly odoriferous plant in veg.”"
NoRobo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramelicious/reviews/1368717,"“I have heard of this strain for quite awhile. I saw it in town for a good deal. Figured I woild finally give it a try. The flowers are nice litte green buds, trim job was not the best though. The smell wasn't quite there at first, after a few days in the jar she smelled much sweeter. The smoke is a little harsh on inhale but smoothed out on exhale with a sweet note on yhe tounge. The high was ok, a little uplifting. ...”"

Deitab,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramelicious/reviews/1348882,"“Caramelicious has an amazing taste, really does taste like Sweet Caramel.  Great smoke for relaxing but not totally knocking you out.  Doesn't smell like it tastes, smells kinda sour, but then once you smoke it and taste it, then smell it again, it does kind of smell like the taste.  A very nice smoke.  Going in my top 10.”"

With strains that are sweet like this one, some times it takes a bit to start tasting it, and that was the case with this.  Nice flower, nice buzz, nice taste.  A great strain to try!”"

Myrcene: 1.64 mg/g
Limonene: 0.01 mg/g 
Caryophyllene: 0.11 mg/g”"
