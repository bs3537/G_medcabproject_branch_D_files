Kmart2002,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wonder-kid/reviews/1379643,"“It had a surprising sweet taste and left an unbelievable high for at least 2 hours”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wonder-kid/reviews/1561200,"“This is a great, complex strain. Beautiful light green buds, super fluffy, with a light aroma of dirt and coffee. Very coffee-y. The high hits hard and fast... before my joint was done, I was laid out flat against the couch, just chilling. The first rush is intense euphoria and muscle relaxation... it fades quickly into a more typical pure indica high. I ended my sesh with a weed nap.”"
Goldieluna,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wonder-kid/reviews/1381255,"“This is really nice and strong. It kind of tastes like citrus  with a hint of sweetmint.  One nice bowl does the trick and helps with stress and pain. a great sleepytime strain.”"
