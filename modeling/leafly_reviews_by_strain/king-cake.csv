King Cake
=============
elacey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/king-cake/reviews/1386135,"“King Cake is a very solid hybrid, with a smooth rich almost desserty taste and a deep pungent aroma. It is a strain you will be fortunate to get your hands on.  The high is that of a hard hitting hybrid, creative and mellow without being inmotivating. Daily users will really enjoy that it is seemily tolerance resistance.”"
BzEz94,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/king-cake/reviews/1550826,"“King Cake is on of the most beautiful buds with a taste to match. You will first recognize the dark silver leaves with spots of purple throughout. This strain will give you a nice high after a pleasant smoking experience.”"

It had a bit of a spicy taste to it and some sweetness. I felt relaxed but I was definitely energetic as well. Appetite kicked in but not strongly, so I was able to control not buying everything in front of me. afterwards I felt pretty tired however and just wanted to crash. Overall very recommended.”"
DarkToast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/king-cake/reviews/1276967,"“This is one of my favorite strains. The high is very calming, not couch-lock inducing but a touch of the munchies. The flavor is a unique blend of a licorice basil with a skunky dankness. It smells very strongly. The colors are striking, purples yellows and oranges together with green. The buds are covered with glistening trichomes. Highly recommended.”"
