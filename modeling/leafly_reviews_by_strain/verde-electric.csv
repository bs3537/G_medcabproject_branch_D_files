Verde Electric

bsolo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1360781,"“Verde Electric is a new type of Girl Scout Cookie. Similar to the Purple Cookie. But with more of a Cherry Pie/ Og/ Durban Poison mix that looks/ tastes amazing. I'm from the bay and know GSC. This hybrid is an overall balanced high that lasts a very long time and is close to the top of my list of buds. Unlike the Purple GSC, Verde Electric doesn't make you as thirsty. Love to medicate and socialize on it. No paranoi...”"
BrianStrm,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1322033,"“Bought preroll of "verde electric" at Harvest of Tempe. Really enjoying it. Has potential to be an all day strain, but relaxation is so heavy for me I can see the potential for it to be benificial for insomnia and pain. Uplifting, euphoric, relaxed. I was having GI problems before the smoke. After half the roll I was good. Havent gotten the munchies.

 Also bought "Fire OG" and "Banana OG" 1/8th packs. Will be review...”"
KaliKid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1070604,"“A very well put together strain!!! Not a copy cat it is certainly unique. The flavor is indescribably delicious and is delightfully smooth. It has a slight cherry taste with an after taste similar to but better than the Girl scout cookies and as far as I know that is one of the strains the Verde Electric is crossed with. Moving here from the S.F. Bay Area this is the best smoke I have had. It is well worth the drive...”"
shawnknows,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1237307,"“Verrry smooth smoke, balanced high, great flavor, and great looking nug.  Supposed to be a 50/50 hybrid, but it acts slightly more like a sativa dominant strain.”"
whistler,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1237306,"“An excellent bud!  First impression was an intense all over body-buzzing high-great for pain management and those in need of a mental hovercraft.  Second phase eased into the gut.  Can see where this would be a good choice for those with nausea.  Third, the head effect is bright and euphoric, not at all stoney, and it lasts a long time.  Finally, it let's you down like a cloud.  Can't say anything inspiring about the...”"
shawnknows,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1070608,"“A dispensary near my house, Harvest of Tempe, carries this strain.  They say that their growers created it by crossing girl scout cookies and cherry pie.  I've used it many times now, and it's one of my favorites.  The first hit fills the head, and the second starts to travel down the body.  It sounds crazy, but I feel like I can regulate the high by taking more or less.  It's not harsh at all.  My friends say they l...”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1507126,"“Did you ever not try a strain because someone you don't like loves it & is a total noon to cannabis
Well I wish I would've tried it sooner. I got it in shatter form by Canamo. SO STICKY. Every now & then I come across wax so sticky and hard to break off into dabs and this was one of them.
I can't explain the high or the taste it's unique in a good way.
Great for any time of day.”"
mollisme2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1332312,"“I really like this strain! It is great for pain management and I love that it doesn't make me hungry. Stretching feels really good and it gives hours of pain relief.”"
jbgoodies,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1070612,"“This was a very good strain.  Nice and lime green with a nice skunky fruity smell.  Also was very smooth and tastefull.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1514396,"“I didn't think I'd like this strain as much as I do, I kept hearing mention of there being a cookie strain in it. Cookie strains don't usually work for me.  
It has a really awesome head buzz, the kind of stoned feeling I'm usually after to treat my stress.
I got a half gram of shatter by Canamo concentrates 74% THC (for an amazing deal, fifteen smackeroos tax incl.) 
I'm glad I got to try this strain in concentrate ...”"
ejs190,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1505098,"“Whoever named it Verde Electric must have been stoned when they named it. Clearly they meant to name it after the internet speed in Camp Verde. Super heady yet light. Good chilling weed. Grinds well for joints. Not super high thc.”"
vincentvega,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1218588,"“I felt relaxed but not tired.  Taste is ok.  But enjoyed the buzz.   Smooth and lasting.”"
medsneeded,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1070613,"“This was compared to Girl Scout Cookies, but it's definitely not the same.  It can bring you WAY down unlike GSC...  It tasted good but the low-tilt factor should be mentioned.”"
highfellow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1218590,"“Only tried this strain once and it was remarkable. Tastes very sweet and I will never forget it. Medicated for about five hours. Has a sour/honey smell!”"
K28,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1237305,"“This strain should have been called something like Dr. FeelGood.  It offers a light sativa head high and gives an overall euthymic feeling.”"

Bought DS Tru Terp cartrides in this strain. I FELL IN LOVE!!! Takes care of pain, lifts my spirits, gives me energy. I am happy and can get things done. BUT then there are times when it helps me sleep. I cant even explain it...its like it "knows" what my body needs. Which sounds ridiculous, I know. LOL!!!  But seriously this has been the most incredible strain for me. I am metaphorically hooked.
 THE only...”"

rottnzonie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1262069,"“Tried this strain in oil/concentrate form. Very nice smooth effects, seemed to last evenly for at least a couple of hours. The taste reminded me more of honey, earthy, sour type strains... don't underestimate the munchies that may follow, they took me by surprise!”"

laidbackjt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1319066,"“GSC and Cherry Pie make a nice clear headed and great feeling high! Good for nausea for sure! Buds are small and compact and very dense. Really like the smell and the flavor.”"
italianstallion91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/verde-electric/reviews/1483940,"“Definitely better with friends, puts a smile on your face and makes you friendly. This is a great strain for stress and anxiety. Definitely gets the appetite going. Not dizzy or stony, no headache, no paranoia or nausea. 
Didn't really have problems getting sleepy or anything, pretty good mental clarity. 
Not really much to say about the flavor, smoked a joint and I think I'd better tell the flavor with a vape, so I'...”"

Got home and cracked open the bag. The bud does not have many leaves, as it is very dense, sticky and covered in orange spider legs. Gorgeous. 

Took my first hit out of my 24" Illadelph straight-shot. Taste is pungent and almost like diesel. No...”"
