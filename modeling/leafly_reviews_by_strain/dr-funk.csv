Dr. Funk

Camels78,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dr-funk/reviews/1384795,"“I wanted to find a strain that "ticked" all the boxes of what I wanted from a strain.  I'd never tried this before yesterday and it was a wonderful experience.  It hit hard at first, got my coughing out of the way and then just hours of enjoyment.  Smelled like stanky-lemons but man my Gf and I just laughed and laughed.  Like rolling around on the floor laughing at each other and how high we were.  Then we showered a...”"

That's why it came as a mind blowing surprise what this Dr. Funk laid out for me: soothing lean back head and body profile. 

For my taste, the cruise ship of strains. Great nighttime.

Relax heavy on this one, feel cats dissipate, almost 5 minutes into it......”"
mistergreenfeet,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dr-funk/reviews/1372179,"“Strong as hell, knocked me right out. Great for insomnia. Didn't need to smoke much either, pretty much one hit quit. Tastes and smells great, a bit sweet.”"

TaperDean,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dr-funk/reviews/1372178,"“For whatever reason, when I picked up a pre-roll of Dr Funk at Green Planet, I thought of Morgan Freeman as Easy Reader on Sesame Street. A more appropriate visual came to mind once the high took hold... which was immediately: Dr Teeth... he of Dr Teeth and the Electric Mayhem from The Muppet Show. I felt groovy... which isn't a word I would normally use, but the high, along with it's Dr Funk mascot  inside of my hea...”"
GhostOfJack,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dr-funk/reviews/1372181,"“This Strain should be called Dr Viagra or Dr. F*ck.  About half way through a bowl I got a euphoric come up that gave me goose pumps, I'm sure there is a terpene or cannabinoid in this strain that dilates blood vessels as I soon became aroused.  Music was enhanced, I quickly changed the song lineup to slow jamz and proceeded to engage in a mating ritual not unlike those male birds you see trying to entrance their wom...”"

tupalo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dr-funk/reviews/1369480,"“Great taste and very potent. Had a little edge to it for me so was not the best for sleep. Strong head buzz to go along with the body high.”"
cannablissmama,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dr-funk/reviews/1372180,"“Love it! Super tasty &super heady. Gorgeous sherbet orange hairs with frosty white trichomes covering the grass green buds. Perfect day time bud as not a heavy indica &won't give you couch lock. I picked up an eighth of this Grateful Meds Talent for a reasonable price! Very pleased!”"
LunarPhantom,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dr-funk/reviews/1567124,"“I was having quite a bit of a problem looking for a strain that didn't induce paranoia. I have high anxiety, so I knew I had to find the perfect indica strain.

And let me tell you, I found the right damn strain.

There isn't that much of a head high. However, the effect on your body is amazing. You feel a bit numb, as if you're floating on a cloud. I have the time of my life cooking and playing video games with this...”"

Shadowforcenick,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dr-funk/reviews/1374758,"“I tried some Dr. Funk BHO by Bhombkellys. The flavor was very mediocre, and I have trouble identifying any flavors other than earthy. The high had a punch to it, no lie. Very front loaded high that will leave you wondering why the sky is blue and why you aren't eating. Overall a unique high.”"
