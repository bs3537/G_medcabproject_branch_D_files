kroniqtopus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tropic-thunder/reviews/1410630,"“Awesome strain. Testing at only about 18% thc, Tropic Thunder is a great example of the entourage effect as this is a pretty heavy sativa. Sweet tropical fruity flavor, with a nice happy energy. Great for outdoor activities and video games too. Try this from AMA in Vegas.”"
Naidarq,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tropic-thunder/reviews/1411481,"“I would like to start off by saying the smell is very overwhelming. Very sweet but almost sickly. This is the only strain I have ever smelled that made me think "wtf?" and question smoking it. The buds are very dense. First glance you really only see bright greens and oranges, but once grinded you can easily see all the purple hidden as well. For me personally, I find this strain to be very relaxing, mildly euphoric,...”"

So I broke it open and emptied it into a small baggie and marveled at how fine the kief was.  I took a baggie whiff.  The smell is a little tangy and fruity at the same time, which belies the almost non-descript mellow flavor one gets when pulling a hit off a pipe.  It is very easy on the Lungs both going...”"

jerbear88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tropic-thunder/reviews/1422848,"“I love the way this bud smells!  Very tropical and sweet. Super surprised at how hard this strain hit me because I have been dabbing for the last week.. I would definitely get it again because it scores high with me on taste, smell, and high. The only negative thing I would say for me personally is the high doesn't stick with you very long, but again that could be the week of dabs that I'm comparing it too.”"

SallyStoned,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tropic-thunder/reviews/1374809,"“The tropical hints of flower make the scent really stand out, while it didn't test too high in thc, I felt like the high was a little too heavy. I picked up an eighth AMAs from Las Vegas Releaf on the strip. I would recommend it based on the scent alone.”"
hollykula808,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tropic-thunder/reviews/1688636,"“very impressed with this strain, absolutely delicious flavor and great mellow cerebral high perfect for socializing, with still a very strong body high! little goes a long way even with high tolerance.”"
