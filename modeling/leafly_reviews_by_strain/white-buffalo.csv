I imagine it that many of these reviews are written by people who have had lots of experience with the spectrum of various highs you get from hybrids and clear sativas. I am a heavy indica user and rely on indicas for the body high and the sleepiness. For those like me - just a heads up - the typ...”"

It also seems to get the creativity flowing, but in my experience also makes me very focused on fine details which makes me work slower (but better).

The smoke is a warm and leathery with citrusy notes.  And the onset of euphoria is quick.  Like a buffalo at speed.  The feeling is warm maple syrup slowly pouring down through your brain, melting away anxiety.  And then when it's time to work?  It focuses like a laser beam.  No wonder it's a classic.”"

culture_cypher,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-buffalo/reviews/1661339,"“very good for depression. Instant mood stabilizer. Heavy relaxation but perfect to socialize on. A higher review mentioned telling beginners to be careful with this strain and that is true. This is very close to hash but if youre experienced with marijuana its totally manageable. Do not head to dinner on this if youve never smoked oil,keef,resin or any other kind of hash.. It may make you feel wiped out. If I could ...”"
druidwriter,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-buffalo/reviews/1369542,"“I'm pretty much used to sativas coming on slow and then creeping along. It was the second hit of the white buffalo concentrate when I was set to wonder if I'd smoked an indica by mistake. Yep I was hammered and it did keep creeping to higher states for about 45 more minutes. I really recommended the white buffalo strain for pain relief with the benefiting high that comes it brings to the table..”"

Mr.BC.Cheese720,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-buffalo/reviews/1318715,"“White buffalo has beautiful tall frosty nug's  that are lite but have few stems, also has unique flavor that has  aroma that is slightly sweat, pepper flowery like taste. It burn's clean and the high is a 70% sativa that can keep you going on through out you're day but some what rare to find, so if you can for sure try it out.”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/white-buffalo/reviews/1418501,"“Top shelf active strain, great for staying motivated and energized. Complex sweet fruity scent with a sour punch that reminds me a bit of some Trainwreck crosses I've tried in the past. High builds and builds even after just one hit and starts from the head down. Unique body buzz that still leaves me light on my feet and clearheaded. 4.5/5.”"

This sativa dominant strain really wakes you up with a crisp sour, berry flavor. Inhale and exhale taste equally great. Makes me feel very euphoric as well as kills an pain. This stuff is awesome, a must have!”"
