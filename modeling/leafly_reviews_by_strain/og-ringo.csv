Usually I add this on to the end of a medicating-sesh @ times of extraordinary pain from recent spinal fusion. For a veteran, this-alone would provide only physical relief, not a mentally-fun head-high in which we may be in search.. 👽
A newbie may find this a perfect way to enter the mmj-community! 👌🏻 Lovely, very mel...”"

A good yielder and of some of the best OG Kush u will ever find. Grown properly this is the best og kush I have ever had, hands down. The potency is off the charts, she consistently hits nearly 28%thc and over 1%cbd. Best kush on the planet, when grown and flushed properly..  Its a MUST tr...”"
tsidener,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1221418,"“Very aromatic buds, one of the smoothest smokes I've had. The taste is great and without a harsh after taste. Depending on the bowl size you load, the high lasts for 3 hours or so and sparks creativity and euphoria. Very mellow comedown that just relaxes the whole body and makes me ready to sleep. Get it from Sunburstbud if you can, there's is top quality.”"
CMAllen2419,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1521184,"“I smoke for pain relief and because I enjoy getting high.

This strain has enough CBD and a lot of THC so I get both things that I enjoy.

If you see this buy it”"

This is a review of Interra Oils Pure cartridge

Within a minute I could feel it calming me down, and putting my head in a relaxed state. This strain is more on the medical side, as it has relatively higher amounts of CBD (pain relief) and CBG (wonderful for glaucoma, insomnia, anxiety). D...”"
nevasta,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1267292,"“Extremely extremely low high with this strain, smoked 3 bowls back to back and furthest I got was a relaxed body high with a clear mind. Normally ANR has absolute top notch stuff but will have to say this was a major bummer strain. Would probably only recommend for patients that need mild pain control, I would compare it to taking an Advil...”"

Brakins,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1397557,"“I've smoked a few different strains and this (smoked it for the first time last night) is so far my favorite so far. The description is fairly accurate with the testes I got out of it. The stuff I have it's outdoor grown and even for outdoor stuff out I took some of the smoothest hits I've ever taken. The effects creep up on you and hit you in full force out of no where. It made me really happy and talkative followed...”"

WickedMickey17,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1389739,"“Exactly what P.T.S.D., ADD/ADHD, and anxiety patients should be checking out! So sweet and tasty when dabbed right and the flower is just staggeringly pungent.
Relieved all the stress and tension with long lasting effects for any physical discomfort.
Just made my top 5 🙇🏼🙇🏼🙇🏼”"
99JointsontheWall,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1435867,"“I don't know that it was anything to write home about really, since I liked the other weed I bought at the same time better, but whatever. It was like some commercial BC bud back in the day to me, which was worth the money, but just not stellar or really tasty.”"
jaye.of.the.bay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1158957,"“Small, heavy crystallized buds.
Smells similar to a tomato plant, with a hint of citrus.
Smooth, medium bodied hit.”"

Ogdoctor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1357220,"“This Strain puts a stane of mental completeness upon your mind,  with a relaxin Sensation to chill back and recline and get inclined with this Your Euphoric uplifting amazing smoke”"
NippoHippo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1368131,"“My personal favorite strain. qualities of sativa but is Indica dominant. Only other strain that would compare imo would be great white shark though I much prefer OG Ringo. The high is intensely euphoric while also being a coach melter. 11/10 would recommend!”"
mellywilly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1389985,"“This is the first strain I've tried that relaxes my fibro shoulder pain. I will be keeping this on hand as a go to!”"
heliumhigh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1181490,"“OG Ringo is what makes OG Kush a connoisseur’s choice. The first hit is an earthy, musty flavor with an aftertaste of lemon. Be warned, the instant kick delivered can catch even the hardiest of smokers off guard. Expecte euphoric effects with some visuals and a high that lasts anything up to three hours.”"
Sandcruncher,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-ringo/reviews/1316807,"“This stuff rocks.  Gives you an instant high that will blow your sock off.”"
