shit. maybe the name suits it. get it? suits it? 

exactly. rename should be DSnT. don't smoke n text.”"
BernieMadoff0001,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/heisenberg-kush/reviews/1434473,"“Very weak strain. Not potent at all.
I smoke double what I normally would smoke, and it still fails to get a decent job done.

Pros: It is pot, so if you get it free you may as well accept it. Smoke enough and you will get a small high.

Cons: Weak strain.”"
