It leaves a sort of fermented flavor in the mouth much like the aftertaste of a glass of sparkly. Sweet smelling and potent - the high hit me like a brick of euphoria and relaxation.”"

I got to take gravities, and the first I got a nice chill high then the second I was just having a good time. All my stress was relieved. What I loved the most about this hybrid strain was I still had a sense of alertness and self-control. I was playing some GTA, and I drove great haha Just my mental and physical capabilities were all there. I did get some light ...”"

The scent is kind of a lovely cheese funky smell to me but the taste is tingly on your tongue and nose, just like sippin' champagne. Or at least some champipple. For me this was a 50/50 hybrid kind of pain relief and cerebral effects but not at all overwhelming. Better for day use than night use in my experience. Bu...”"

DARTH_VAPOR,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/champagne-kush/reviews/1273143,"“I've been vaping this the last few nights a few hours before bed. It's giving great body tingles, and an overall feeling of relaxation. I don't feel TOO much of a sativa energy rush with this one, so I feel like its an indica dominant hybrid (I'm not sure tho). It's a relaxing, calming, and very pleasant strain. Great for unwinding towards the end of the day, relieving stress, anxiety. I've also noticed my arms going...”"

Simplxcity,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/champagne-kush/reviews/1724142,"“It hits really quick but not incredibly hard like a heavy indica would but this strain has the same mind and muslce sedated feel without you passing out completely. 

This is great for somone that has a lot on their mind, stress, anxiety etc... Keeps you at a serene and calm pace with an uplifting feel. 

Tastes and smokes great as well.”"

khudozhnik,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/champagne-kush/reviews/1316144,"“While relaxing and flavorful the high is a little too mellow, no headiness to match the body relaxation. Good for night-time smoking.”"
theherbalista,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/champagne-kush/reviews/1084573,"“Smooth, clean smoke with a mellow high. Helpful for body/nerve pain in a mild numbing way. Real easy, go with the flow type of effect, best for when nothing in particular needs to get down, as it makes you get stuck for random periods of time. Euphoric and Uplifting, for sure! Definitely recommend!”"

From what I can see, it's a medium green color and I can see a good amount of crystals. Good high, but doesn't seem to last too long.”"

I can get paranoid on most other strains, but I feel like my anxiety kind of just floats away like a bad dream. Definitely a mood lifter - one hit is lovely if you need to be productive, more is wonderful for settling in for the night.”"
