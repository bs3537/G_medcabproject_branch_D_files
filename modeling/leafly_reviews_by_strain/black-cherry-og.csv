Midnyte003,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-cherry-og/reviews/1393672,"“Great tasting and effects!  Tasted like black cherry syrup before it's mixed with carbonation to make soda.  Rolled this with a Blueberry Juicy Jay paper and it was amazing.  No ashy taste, no skunky taste, just sweet berries.  Worked great for my muscles, PMS, put inflammation down, worked as an anti-depressant, I was happy/giddy, but a bit spacy and dizzy... overall just really great.  Definitely get this if you se...”"
WastedChef,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-cherry-og/reviews/1391149,"“I'm really digging this. I feel so happy; almost like a crack head finding a menthol. My dog is looking at me like he's jealous. I told him, maybe I'll make you a little dog canni-biscuit. Is that a thing? It should be. It tasted really good too; much like a 25 year old virgin, perfectly ripened but maybe a little bruised. The smell reminded me of the aromatics from when a black cherry explodes in your mouth, except ...”"

historianerd,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-cherry-og/reviews/1396457,"“A common 15$/g strain, when I got this bad boy at 10$/g, I was psyched. A relaxing body high that doesn't push you too far down the Indica hole, but let's you feel comfortable and eased. Had pseudo-Sativa like mental effects that brought me to an uplifting plateau.”"

10000waves,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-cherry-og/reviews/1292787,"“It certainly has a fruity, cherry-like flavor and aroma when vaporized. It was pleasant to imbibe.  

I generally like Indicas as they don't hype me up as much as the more Sativa dominant strains.  This provided good relief from a strong migraine and was quite relaxing (maybe too much).  But, it also seemed to 'numb' me out which wasn't exactly what I wanted in that moment.  

So, IMHO experience good for pain manage...”"

anchimaru,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-cherry-og/reviews/1393134,"“Gotta say... this strain does the most for my insomnia thus far. The ONLY side effect that I experience from this (when smoked) is that I tend to want to be alone. Not depressingly or anything, just sorta want my own space to think or do something like write or paint. If I smoke this with people, I tend to get irritated. When vaped, I have that same side effect and I also get CRAZYYYYY dry mouth.”"

Buds were sticky with a nice lighter green and smelled like kush and black cherries... Always love when the name ain't a claim.... Flavor while smoking also stayed true to the name. Definitely a new favorite of mine and I'm sure yours as well. Don't sleep on this one.”"

Great high! keep a drink near by.”"

It's hard to see but there's amber/orange hairs speckled throughout the dense nugget. Hit 1 tasted/smelt like a strong smoke/aroma. Hit 2 tasted like berries and my mouth started to water; hit 3 I felt stress relief and muscle relaxation as well as an appetite.”"

Relieved a lot of stress and tension that had built over months that other strands didn't even touch. The flavor is pleasant and sweet; there's no skunk or ash taste to this strain. Aroma is almost mouth watering. It helped ease pain from Crohn's and I slept like a dang baby. 10/10 would smoke anytime.”"
