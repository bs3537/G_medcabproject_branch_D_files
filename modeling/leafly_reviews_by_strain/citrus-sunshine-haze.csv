Being a long time smoker from my years in medical and now as a bud tender, I have been able to experience too many kinds of cannabis to name. This super lemony, sweet tangerine like bud has placed itself up there with the best of them. The effects are immediate and the onset rush of energy without the anxiety which was ever so pleas...”"

Uplifting, social, functional, but totally satiating, and very heady. She is like sunshine in a bag, and who couldn't use a little sunshine in their lives.  I personally love this strain and can't wait to share it with all of you.”"
EMMAHEAD,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrus-sunshine-haze/reviews/1396517,"“This strain  has a new twist to it for sure. The sweet hints of lemon and lime with the 28% thc ,made up from the three different pheno. types. Finely a strain I can be productive on, pain free and still relaxed...... THANKS CEREAL KILLER, YOU KILLED IT!!!!!!!!”"

Just had a bit and nothing negative. No anxiety just straight sunshine. Definitely a good strain for Bi-Polar and the like. 
As far as the bud itself it has a great fluffyness to it but still tight, Some nice orange hairs, Great odor (allergy season so I can't describe in detail lol)...”"

Trisha44,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrus-sunshine-haze/reviews/1391248,"“I enjoyed each 14 grams of this stuff. Its appeal is how high you get. It's like an instant escape from negative thinking. The smell and taste was pretty good, not amazing, but grew on me as I smoked it 'til it was gone. I wouldn't go searching for it, but would get it on sale.”"
Nestlay88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrus-sunshine-haze/reviews/1592561,"“Taste like fruit, citrus is what it look like, big high (sharpens ears). Everything exepted from a Haze strain, long lasting high, "1 hit fit". Daytime use, 3-4 hours minimum before sleep. Does not feel sleepy at all, and when the high is over fall into deep sleep. If you take this at 9h you can sleep around 12. Still hard to wake up even after a 8 hour sleep so carefull.”"

rjmadisoniii,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrus-sunshine-haze/reviews/1653417,"“Easily one of my favorite evening couchlock strains.  Despite a fairly heavy body high, you're left feeling slightly heady, but with heightened senses.  

Food tastes far better, and the munchies are uncontrollable (honestly, I've never truly tasted ice cream until I smoked this).  Has a time slowing effect - what I mean by that is that you have more clarity of thought and head space to develop a cogent conversation....”"
