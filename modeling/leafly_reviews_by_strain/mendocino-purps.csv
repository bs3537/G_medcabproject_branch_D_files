I've tried several other strains recommended for depression, and, though they do work in their own way, none of them so far have been able to be quite as effective as this strain.”"

Defiantly got me lit gave me a nice energetic high and helped me get things done. Good for pain seemed to help me with that as I just relaxed after work and enjoyed the smoke.”"

Covered in a blanket of trichomes under a delicious hue of purple. The taste matches the smell and the effects outstanding. I would consider this strain to be one for the true connoisseur.”"

The bud is beautiful not only to the eyes but the touch as well. It is dense and neatly packed. The color is mainly green with deep hues of purple and it is covered in light orange hairs with a significant amount of trichomes.
The smoke comes on very smooth inhale and exhale. It is a bit earthy with a hint of citrus and/or fruit in my opinion. It's delicious.
