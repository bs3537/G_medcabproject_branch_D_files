Dear brother has a nice income, so dropping $100 every other day on top shelf grams is a no-brainer for him. And he likes to share. SO: Peppermint Cookies! Oh, peppermint! oh, cookies! Oh, I think I forgot to park the cat. One hit (he likes to share, but also frugal) and I was dancing. Singing, off-key. Telling any cat my secrets. This was Gold Leaf Garden...”"

I was scared to even try it to be honest, it was way pungent and skunky.  However!!!! Tastes amaaazing - I got Birthday Cake Juicy Jay papers specifically for this strain.  It's like chocolate chip mint cookies when you smoke out of a roll, have yet to try it vaped, but I'm excited.  There's absolutely no ashy/burnt taste to it ...”"

It was a little pricey, but actually worth it. Really beautiful. The high is extreme, very cerebral (trippy) at first, slowly blends into mind/body..really pleasant. Lasts a looooong time too. I vaped a small amount and was blasted for 3-4 hours. AMAZING SHIT. My current fave.
This was my first visit to Origins, and I think I've foun...”"
WSWALTER,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/peppermint-cookies/reviews/1349698,"“Easy on the lungs when using a flower vape, the high creeps steadily but not too slow. Been vaping this stuff for about 3 weeks and like always, took me a bit to get used to the new strain. First couple uses:  got a little confused about when to talk to the bartender, spilled some food, talked too loudly without realizing it. Relaxes the face and makes you stop thinking about nausea. I can get into a cleaning mode on...”"
MotaMatt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/peppermint-cookies/reviews/1363897,"“I'm really excited to give this strain a review because I can say in confidence that there is no mistaking the "awesomeness" of the Peppermint Cookies.  From smelling its' aroma from opening the jar to that "cookie doughesque," OG-fuel flavor on the exhale, you know you got that "fai-yah" with the Peppermint!  

I'll say this: If you had company from out-of-state, and you wanted to give them a stellar representation ...”"
g.kirk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/peppermint-cookies/reviews/1381069,"“Absolutely the best phenotype of GSC out on the market right now. I've never really been a big fan of the cookie strains but peppermint cookies packs a punch that will knockout a rookie and sedate a veteran consumer for a while. I didn't find much of a mint scent or taste but it had that strong pine/woody smell that comes with cookies. It is a must try if you can get your hands on it!”"
rockstardoctor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/peppermint-cookies/reviews/1430209,"“This strain has risen into my top  10.  This amazing strain has a piney, sweet taste with an undertone of mint.  it's delicious.  the smoke is so smooth you can easily take pulls from the spliff... My lungs are trained, but this has never made me cough.  The high is relaxing but not terribly sedating.  The bag I got definitely leaned towards sativa dominant because my mind was alive with great thoughts.  Focus to do ...”"
PrincessButtercup,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/peppermint-cookies/reviews/1349696,"“Goldleaf is by far my favorite company! This peppermint cookies has been a staple for me for 2 years now! No other company has flowers that always make me this happy! I swear you can taste the Aloha in every jar! They love what they do and it shows! They definitely make great medicine!”"

TheFriendlyViking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/peppermint-cookies/reviews/1255202,"“Peppermint Cookies by Gold leaf Gardens Listed as a hybrid and I think that's accurate. 

If I remember correctly it is 24% THC with an effect that left me feeling talkative and gave me the munchies. The descriptions of it being sweet minty and honey like are true I also picked up a bit of pepper too.

This is a good all around strain that I haven't heard a complaint about as it seems agreeable to most who partake.”"
aliyaaanicole,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/peppermint-cookies/reviews/1280995,"“Wish I can put 4.5 stars lol. Very good strain, but I also agree with details on the background! I would love to know about this hybrid. Gold Leaf never disappoints”"
AaronOdiwuor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/peppermint-cookies/reviews/1256603,"“If you’ve purchased Peppermint Cookies by Gold Leaf Gardens like I have, you’re also in AWE! This took first place hybrid in 2015 and after consuming you’ll understand why. Looks lovely with sparkly Trichomes all over and is very sticky and extremely euphoric. The most enjoyable flavor I’ve tasted in ages, never ashy, a 5/5 experience. FIRE!!”"

hplfan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/peppermint-cookies/reviews/1271083,"“Stoney stuff.  Similar to XJ-13.  Not as relaxing as Blue Dream or Dutch Treat, but the Gold Leaf farm is known for their consistency.”"

It has an unmistakable minty taste and is very yummy and sweet. I highly recommend this sort of unusual strain. Much like Cotton Candy, this strain is true to its name in taste.”"

The effect was a nice active mellow that had me relaxing after my day of work and was happy to chat it up with co workers after our sesh.

Flavor was Pepper and mint in a nicely separated way that had pepper in front with mint at the back end. Very enjoyable.”"

A little on the dry side so it crumbled very easily.  However, the taste is great, the smell before burning was a little earthy and flowery.  During burning it was a hypnotic scent...not over powering...but just right.  Effects...uplifting, comfortable, holly-jolly, relaxed, in-tune to everything and dry mouth.  Bottle of water needed!

Appearance:  Beautiful dark purple calyces covered with dense frosty trichromes... and I mean covered.  Orange stigmas running throughout.  The density is impressive.

Smell/Taste:  The smell is earthy with hints of mint that give way to that trademark gas scent when a nug is pulled apart.  Simply ...”"

I'm curious though is this somehow different than the thin mint cookies?  I get mostly an original cookies smell and taste to it..  Not a bad thing but I'm interested to know the story behind the genetics of this strain.  Also the smell is not "loud" more of a mellow sweetness.. Overall though I would recommend it especially because go...”"
