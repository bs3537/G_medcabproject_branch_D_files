garriswh,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/q3/reviews/1361478,"“Smaller nugs, but they look really good - super frosted with vibrantly bright orange hairs. Smooth toke with a pretty subtle taste of lemon and fruity sweetness. Potent effect that isn't too racy for a sativa. A good daytime strain. Hope to try some more TGA strains soon.”"
