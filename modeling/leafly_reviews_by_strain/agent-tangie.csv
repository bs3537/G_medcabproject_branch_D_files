I love the tangerine skunkie aroma and taste, this pretty littleil lady, packs a huge punch. Really good for pain and daytime activities. The original Tangie had such a long finishing time that I had to think of a strain that wouldn't mess the Terpines up to far from the original Tangie, so I crossed it with AK-47= Agent Tangie! However,I may have only taken about ...”"

TerpFreak,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/agent-tangie/reviews/1375384,"“This strain is one of my favorites, except for the long budding period. The Smell is like no other medicine you'll ever smell and once you've smoked on this strain for a while it's hard to find another to obtain the same level of euphoria do to the abnormally high THC level, making this strain one for the record books in my opinion. I crossed Tangie with AK-47 and this is what I got and I really like the Straight tas...”"

I'm sure it's gonna be a master piece. Tangie X AK-47 & back X it with Skunk #1, then back X once again with the original Tangie. Can't wait I'm excited, but it's gonna take some time. I will eventually get it done an post it on this awesome site. "I love you people at Leafly"!! Thanks for t...”"

ArchetypalHigh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/agent-tangie/reviews/1783743,"“<Low temps> (flavor)- orange zest, sugary, slightly herbal. (High)- extremely clear headed, bright and focused, sensation of feeling taller than you actually are (a get shit done high). (Come down)- slightly groggy and brain fog. Not terrible but not great. You will know you’ve smoked AT for the rest of the day.

<High temps> (flavor)- more herbal, less orange. (High)-time warps, psychedelic, slightly panicky,  thoug...”"

TerpFreak,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/agent-tangie/reviews/1621856,"“This Strain produces two pheno-types for some reason, but the Skinny Tangierine smelling and tasting pheno is the best... the smoothness and the unbelievable terpine profile is out a this world..... this Strain takes 10 or more weeks but produces huge Nuggs, while inside or out.. Flushing is a must with this Strain.... Verry smooth an a creeper, makes you happy and melts away stress.... If you have never had a plant ...”"

I've had it once for a few months but mine wasn't Ak-47 xx Tangie or any other types of this strain listed. Mine was Angent Orange by TGA Subcool x Tangilope or one of the Tangie strains from DNA genetics can't remember which and I wanna say Sin City seeds or connoisseur seeds bred it and sells the strain though. shoot who knows these days with all the copycat's going on. Either way we all se...”"
