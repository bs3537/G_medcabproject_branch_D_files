Why do I like this so much then? Like Durban Poison it is a staple in the world of wonderfulness. Been around since the first days of documentation. I could live in a shanty down by the beach and toke this the rest of my days. Where Mob Boss is going to amp you up and flies you close to the sun, this flies just above a indaca but just below the radar in the sat...”"

Not the smelliest but definitely the stickiest bud ive ever had. Smoked one joint and was high as a kite allllll night, which is probably the longest high ive ever had. 10/10 I want to go back to Jamaica just for this weed.”"

Was stemmy, seedy, and sticky as fuck.  There were plenty of crystals and great smells, no other like it, I just knew I recognized it from the last visit to the island.  I took two quick hits from the new metal pipe I brought with, and i...”"

Really good smooth for me and gets me going in the morning. Colors are more vivid and so is sound. Tobacco is fine with it. I smoke natural grabba though ;) (west indies will understand)”"
quorious,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1360018,"“The Jamaican is great. I have a tendency to feel paranoid/anxious on many  different strains, but I have yet to experience this with the Jamaican. It is also less potent than other strains, so it is easier to make myself the right dose.”"
KIBA040,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1337736,"“There is a shop in east LA called East LA Caregivers. They have this new strain called Jamaican Hot Fire. And it is one of the best strains I have ever had! If you llive near  east LA I highly recommend this shop and the strain!”"
Aksmzk,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1500367,"“This strain and Thai was all we could get back then. I’ve probably smoked pounds of Jamaica over the years. One of the all time best strains.”"
lukewig1999,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1360019,"“if you have this in a big bong it gets u dizzy and chilled it will make you vomit if you through a little vodka in to the mix so my advice vodka is a no go with this weed”"
chablusco,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1251987,"“My friends and I smoked one of this with Canadian kief and it was the strongest joint my friend has ever smoked before! So  strong that he throwed up hahahahahahaha perfect!!! And the best part is I'm writing this while he is in the washroom 👌🏼💥😎 #POWPOWPOW”"
ndfarmer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1464689,"“The smell and taste of the Jamaican strain gives me nostalgia. It takes me back to my early pot smoking days, and I love it. Some strains seem to make me feel more anxious and reserved, but when I smoke the Jamaican strain I feel really comfortable with myself and confident. I love it!!”"

christiancooper,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1364222,"“A lovely smoke. Really smooth I found and was super relaxing and chilled out. Really want to smoke this again just for the fact that it was a super smooth chilling out strain. Would highly recommend.”"
Mathewruhigh,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1381664,"“With one whiff of Jamaican you'll definetly understand why it was it was given the name, with one of the rankest smells ever- you could surely say that if a Jamaican person were turned into a bud that's what it'd smell like. Ok onto the review whith Jamaican you're definetly gonna feel one of the most amazing changes in Gravity almost as if you're on a roller coaster where even when you're sitting your entire body fe...”"

Arbiter,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1155844,"“Of all the different types i have tried i can tell you that jam gives me the best creative high out of all. My eyes get dry but not my mouth. All in all, its in my top 5.”"
Maryjanedoh,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1728180,"“Definitely a true sativa. Bud are dense and smooth taste. Was excited to taste this coffee in this strain but couldn’t taste it.”"

rollingman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1340548,"“its really not pretty (illegally imported therefore compacted) but hell is it good, spicy fruity taste, long lasting energizing high, yet relaxing, and gets you in the mood for your wife if you see what i mean. Waaay better than the frosty chemically grown stuff, pure natural outdoor, dont hit you hard”"
campbellandrew028,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1353711,"“This bud came compact and looked awful but once smoked it gave a nice cerebral high that lasted about an hour and a half. The buds are all squashed together and a dark green colour. The smell is very herbal rather than cannabis smell but when burned you can smell that it's cannabis.”"
jadanovic,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1386112,"“Just finished radiation and found myself to be quite melancholy and fatigued. Vaped just 1/2 gram of Jamaican and I was taken to the happy dimension. TASTE: to me,  it tastes bit like a fruit and diesel combo but pretty smooth otherwise.  FEEL:  I feel taller, prettier, I'm ecstatically happy and energetic. CON; would be the sky high feeling and mild dizziness. OVERALL: Fabulous strain!”"
jamieebee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1223969,"“Very fun high. It made me relaxed but interested in walking around and exploring! I didn't feel lethargic or hungry. Instead I was really into being outdoors and socializing”"

klondikecat,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1223786,"“No worries, jah bless. Great smoke, an uplifting experience, lots of happy vibes, no anxiety and a social smoke to be sure.  It's as if Mr. Robert Marley himself gave this to you and your bredren. Yuh gwine dweet?”"
BrettY98,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1596009,"“Favourite sativa for my buddies cottage! Relaxing but not sedating and you see in HD (Have had 3 others and the bud tender confirm this happens). Very similar effects to lemon haze.”"
codycees,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1141797,"“I got some of this in Jamaica. It's actually pretty crystallized and dense for an outdoor strain. Gives more of a cerebral buzz then anything. Lifts your spirits and gives a boost of energy. If it were grown indoor it would basically be lambs bread quality.”"
pablue16,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1798024,"“Overall very nice, made me real dizzy but I doubt that’s a universal symptom.”"
JustSavita,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1210424,"“Pretty good, pretty cheap, uplifting and relaxing, i like lying down when smoking this and think about good things, try to feel it and just be alone with your thaughts.  😍🌿”"

RainSen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1331363,"“We made cookies with mainly Jamaican in it. It was such a awesome high. no paranoia, no dizziness, no sleeping. only happy feelings and a super euphoric high that lasted for hours.”"

Yasuraka,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1562465,"“Tried different local strains. They say the best is from the west, in my case that was more than true :)
It's the kind of herb you can enjoy all day and not feel dizzy or anxious. It's effects are complementary on your state of mind and body. In the morning, helps to get some energy, in the noon with relaxation and social activities, while in the evening smooths you down to a sleepy and calm feeling.”"

RastaColony,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1706676,"“I had the chance to get some real jamaican stret herb out of a coffee shop in amsterdam. The weed itself was completely ruined by the trip (vacuum sealed). It had a brown color. 
The smell was softer but it was still a great smell. 
When i smoked it, it was the best weed i ever tasted. Not the best high, but the best feeling. Even though the weed had a bad quality, i really enjoyed it.

I even got 70 seeds out of. Th...”"
EwanIndikey,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1687041,"“The Jamaican is always good to take because you like to be relaxed after being energetic. This is alright to take the advantage to be under her effect by the way she is good to find your pleasure by her inhalation. Easy to appreciate and to find good, don't hesitate to take the much you can, it's a strong but simple flower.”"
silk2smooth,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican/reviews/1224154,"“Probably the best strain I've ever had. Purchased it in Jamaica from a lady in market. It gave me such a smooth high. No cough. No hunger. I was just happy to be in a place I've always wanted to visit smoking their finest. Can't wait to go back!”"

Found some from the locals on the resort and I have to say I'm oddly impressed with this stuff. It wasn't the strongest I'd ever smoked by any stretch, it smelled rather terrible and the taste left a lot to be desired but the buzz was all positive. a great sativa high that let you enjoy whatever you dec...”"
