I was feeling very relaxed after my bath and putting lotion on my face and rubbing it in felt incredible. I had my eyes closed and I was imagining that I was about 18 years old. I felt so young and beautiful. Then I opened my eyes and I looked like a female Jim Breuer. it was scary and kind of ruined the high. I kept trying to make my eyes...”"

One of the most pleasant smelling strains, it also hits you quickly and intensely. The high is very uplifting, almost to the point of making you giggly, but doesn't suppress your energy as much as more pure indicas I've had.

clusterfuck,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blueberry/reviews/1380988,"“Overall a great strain, at least for my problems. Though a hybrid, it is very heavy on the Indica. Typical Sativa effects are barely noticeable (at least in this batch); the only thing characteristic of a Sativa here is the lack of couch lock and some definite-head high. This is good, though, as I far prefer Indicas. There is a nice division between the body and head high, with a lovely tingling warmth in my belly an...”"

 I'm only an occasional smoker, so my tolerance is low. The THC percentage was about 16.5%, so it's not a very strong cut, but it was plenty strong enough for me. I've smoked two joints so far, and the effects were exactly what I'm looking for.
