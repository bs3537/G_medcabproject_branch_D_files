Mango Tango
=============
ChubbyCheddah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mango-tango/reviews/1383145,"“The flavor is unbelievable. Its like smoking a Mango that's been blessed with OG Kush's potency but its sweet as an apricot in August. This strain is very delightful and fulfilling. It scores big in taste, it slam dunks with power,  and the medical benefits are a homerun! This is a very social strain, and women love its fruity smell and flavor. It takes two too Mango Tango so let's cut a bud. I recommend trying this ...”"
IandI,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mango-tango/reviews/1369058,"“I'd probably give this one a 4.5. Super fun, silly and uplifting. Talkative and social. Smoked this one with friends and can't wait for it to show up and my dispensary. Zero paranoia and fairly energetic. Smoked all night and never got too high or too tired. Would definitely buy again. Feels like Bruce Banner euphoria with Jack Herer body high and focus.”"

Looks: The buds were big and dense with lots of yellow hairs. OGish yet differnt at the same time. Tons of thick white trichs cover its green and yellow colors like fur.
The shatter where tiny tan squares completly solid and stable,but cut like butter,very nice quality.
Smell/Taste: Always hoped to get bud/shatter combo to compare. The buds smell of a strong tropical ctirus mango with a strong...”"

Lol all I ever see is old reviews... anyways, just rolled this mango tango in a delish mango swisher and I am feeling amazing!! Body is relaxed and I'm in a good mood even after a long day.

ChemicalGeorge,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mango-tango/reviews/1605923,"“Definitely one of my favorite hybrids. I bought 1/8 and the batch came out to 21.9% THC. Upon opening the bottle, my nose was filled with a very smooth, relaxing smell of Mango. It did not have a citrus or sour smell but rather a sweet, calm mango smell. The buds that I got were HUGE. Though the smell is sweet, calm and smooth, don't let that fool you. This strain REALLY packs a punch and if you hit it too hard, you ...”"

Just riding in a car made me incredibly anxious for some reason and it happened a couple times only from this strain. I usually don't have a ceiling for getting high but man these buds made think twice about take too big of a rip. Enjoy! 😀”"

I really died from coughing and fell asleep. The label said sativa dominant but I got a very euphoric body high and a pleasant head high from that entire bowl.

Bud structure & Look: Very small some about the size of a dime popcorn buds.  
Smell: Fruity with floral and skunk undertones. Very fluffy when squeezed that release really nice strawberry and plum lime terpenes.
The Effect & Cause: I notice it captures the li...”"

Neihbor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mango-tango/reviews/1279309,"“Holy moly mango, this indica-heavy hybrid holds true to its name!

The taste bears an uncanny resemblance to raw, juicy mango on the inhale; the exhale yields a sweet tree sap like taste, commonly found in indicas.

Light doses deliver a body heavy functional high. Heavy doses expose the sativa inheritance and indica dominance working in tandem, making it easy to really deliver an intense mind/body high. 

Great for ...”"
1kushking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mango-tango/reviews/1681314,"“In 2015 this strain was the winner of the overall Southern California Cannabis Cup. Smell & taste was a pungent citrus pine. Buds were lighter green with lots of amber hairs. The buds were caked in a fine layer of milky white crystal trichomes & the THC level was 23%. Made me happy, really relaxed, & mildly sleepy. Light it up!!”"
jacktron,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mango-tango/reviews/1375926,"“The smell is an earthy mango, the fluff to dense ratio is pretty even. The flower burns slowly, so you have a chance to smoke it. Overall a nice high of even head high and body high.”"

ghostedandlost,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mango-tango/reviews/1605468,"“Lovely and potent hybrid that leans more towards a sativa spectrum.

Social and energetic high, somewhat toned downed. A reminding light uplifting feeling. Perfect for a long walk.

MangoTango has never been a source for inspiration to me. My creativity is very low and it hurts my ability to work as I work with Math and programming a lot.

The flavour is very rich and has a well balanced citrus taste. More of a typic...”"

It makes me uplifted, happy and talkative.
Makes my eyes and mouth a little dry but not bad.
Smokes real easy and has a sweet taste.
When I smoke by myself, I find myself singing a bunch of songs, even ones I dont like.”"

DanHaze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mango-tango/reviews/1777456,"“This strain tastes EXACTLY like a mango mixed with orange or peach. And the potency was right there with it.

I have anxiety/panic attacks so just seeing "paranoid" on the top of the negative side effects makes me go hmm only negatives I've ever experienced thus far and I've been smoking this strain alone for the last month is dry eyes / dry mouth.

ragarone,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mango-tango/reviews/1264521,"“Very relaxing effects.  For a sativa dominant strain, I was not expecting this.  It is not really couch lock, but it is more mellowing like an indica dominant.  Absolutely no anxiety or paranoia.  I'd say better for nighttime use rather than day use...unless it a day without needing to be motivated!  Really easy and tasty to vape.  One of my new favs.”"
