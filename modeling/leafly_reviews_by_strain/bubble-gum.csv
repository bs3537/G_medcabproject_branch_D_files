It actually has slight undertones and the smell of real bubbleicious bubble gum. The taste gets a bit harsher as you smoke the second half of the Joint.

Has a weird taste when smoked. Some people think it's nasty but others think it is tasty. Tastes a bit like bubblegum.

Gets rid of my depression real nice but it is easy to notice that you are high. Mostly because you get really talkative and energetic from it.

I really like it.”"

The high? Nice gentle chill with pleasant feelings. Not too heavy to get something done. Low anxiety and depression for me...
