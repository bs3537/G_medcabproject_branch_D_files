It is a very potent yet relaxed head high. At first before the mental effects kick in, the body high on its own sets the stage for a chill mood. You just feel so nice and relaxed. So when the mental piercing bullet blown from the AK-47 hits your noggin, your in a good mood to begin with. It induces a...”"

elmofudd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-ak-47/reviews/1418270,"“I bought this as a concentrate (CO2 Cart.) based on the description on Leafly. The product I bought was extremely harsh on the back of the throat. Take tiny hits as the feeling of "expansion" in the lungs causes terrible coughing.

That said, the blast-off with this stuff is the most powerful of anything I have experienced in recent years. I am not exaggerating one bit. For me, it was just as the description indicate...”"
Kajungabear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-ak-47/reviews/1286357,"“The high with Purp AK-47 is unworldly! Smoke this regularly and I am never disappointed! Be careful if you're a newbie to smoking and you get ahold of this shit because it'll knock you on your ass. Bring water, you WILL need it...from smoking this shit practically daily (for about 6 months now.) and it always makes me cough on almost every hit...it's insane and the high lasts for what feels like forever to the person...”"
Bubbles1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-ak-47/reviews/1376022,"“Great grape flavor you'd expect from a purple strain. Really helps with chronic musculoskeletal pain and after a chiropractic treatment. A bit hard hitting and potent on the first experience, so small tokes are best, as its a creeper. Smoke in the evening because it can put you down. Smoke in the morning if you need heavier pain relief and are not leaving the house. I plan to have back stock. I don't want to run out ...”"

dayaja,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-ak-47/reviews/1376023,"“For what the strain is mainly meant to do (knock out pain) I would highly recommend this. But, if you're trying to get messed up off it, don't get too high of hopes (pun not intended). For the first few minutes, the indica is obviously present. Not really enough time to settle in the "stoned" feeling. Then, the sativa takes control. Lots of mental energy, and mild creativeness. It's a good "any occasion" strain. If y...”"

The tag said THC is only 13% but it felt like it was much stronger. Experience similar to what others said, sort of half body feel and half mind Sativa focus. I did feel it very quickly, as description here says, but later it creeped up more and hit harder. I didn't feel sleepy but mind began to shut down. Good ...”"

I'm not a fan of the name but the effects are what the show is about. So, I think the object  of this game is to work hard and play hard; PAK-47 allowed me to do both. Hailed as a "one-hitter" strain, PAK-47 definitely gets the cellular processes going. Cerebral effects are intense for an indica-dom hybrid, and the pain relief is a major fa...”"
Seth22654,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-ak-47/reviews/1319014,"“Easily one of my top 5 strains ever. Very well balanced cross between indica and sativa, relieves body pain greatly without putting you asleep like a pure indica. Highly recommend for patients with chronic pain.”"
logannie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-ak-47/reviews/1199995,"“Awesome strain! Has that great earthy scent and melts away pain and fatigue with the quickness! Definitely enough head stone to melt your mental stress away also. Kick back, smoke a bowl and relax.”"

Not too sleepy, and an uplifted mood, so I prefer this (and this one smells and tastes better). No red eyes and a smooth vape. Some relief of cramps but not enough to get 5 stars.”"

Great evening smoke.”"
