I tend to get a little nausea.  I get headaches if I have a lot. I feel euphoric, goofy, and happy. I have lots more energy even when I’m sitting still. I’m prone to anxiousness and this does not cause any anxiousness in me.”"

twizzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/acid/reviews/1785835,"“This strain looked verry neutral, not so shiny but na nice green color. when opening the bag i smelled bettef then it looked.. and when smoked.. the diesel/gassy small was verry clear!

youngguns7362,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/acid/reviews/1737449,"“very potent like suggested from everyone on here already. i was pretty standoffish because of the name and that i thought it was mislabeled(LSD was the strain i was thinking of). none- of-the-less i got it anyways. at 40% thc, no lie, i was freakin' blown away. its a definite indy-hybrid for sure and i was so relaxed watching a documentary on netflix that i only stopped at a hit, nothing more and honestly, i didn't n...”"

htoneyy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/acid/reviews/1491383,"“Just trying this strain. Was looking for something more earthy tasting and it nailed it! Then the body high was great as well! Love this strain!”"
CanadianCannabisSociety,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/acid/reviews/1571368,"“Wow. As an experienced cannabis user, this strain initially caught me off guard. It didn't look the most sexy, but it was dense & pungent as hell. Definitely indica dominant, and super tasty, a light froot loop scent from it. Nice lung squeeze effect which comes from mostly indicas.”"

levy295,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/acid/reviews/1524236,"“One of THE best strains I've smoked next to Larry og. Very strong and not for the weak. I'm and experienced smoker and me and my friend tapped out halfway through the blunt. Amazing head feeling and makes you very creative.”"
Sjanes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/acid/reviews/1376694,"“Incredible strain, sometimes she gets a little tall but large buds dense and full. I pictures of my runs somewhere's. love the taste, the high everything. Smooth if flushed well and dried even. it has a acid citrus flavor sometimes more to the grapefruit side or the acidic flavor of lemons and pine taste. 
Been running it for a while now and will continue as long as I can.”"
