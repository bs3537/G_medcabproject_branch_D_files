Also I learned how to make the greatest pillow fort in all the land. No girls allowed, just me and my dog Jack (to be fair he came up with the password so I had to let him in).‚Äù"

Appearance:  Violet buds with dark red hairs.  Quite frosty.  Looks like sparkling grape candy. 

Initial, almost immediate high, then tapers off into a physical stoney contentedness, then eventually to couch-locky lethargy.

Great go-to for pain relief!  highly effective long lasting pain reliever for a wide variety of ailments.  If you consume a lot, this can also be grea...‚Äù"

This was my favorite tasting bud of all time. It's pretty arousing so don't smoke unless you have a backup plan.

M.J.Green,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1389362,"‚Äú5 star, no doubt, by far my favorite strain I've came across in a while.  Also had an interesting effect, kind of an "adaptive" feel, like if you're on the go it wont slow you down one bit, but if you got nothing to do but sit around, it has good couch-lock potential as well. Very clean lemon/citrus scent with a slight skunky smell as well.‚Äù"
Hgresz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1394846,"‚ÄúThis strain is amazing. You will feel very relaxed, and have a mild body high (some tingling). My favorite part of this strain is that is doesn't make you feel stupid like some strains can make you feel. It allows you to keep your common sense but relieves pain, anxiety, and makes you just feel all around good.‚Äù"
DarthCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1410222,"‚ÄúLooks: Crazy.  A bright vibrant violet color with an infestation of trichomes and burning red hairs.  Almost no green and charming to the eye.

Smell: Fruity yet dank.  A mixed variety of scents all recognizable.

Taste: Spicy and strong.  A very pleasurable smoke.

Buzz Type: Heavy head stone.  Similar to that of Trainwreck.

Buzz Length: Long lasting.  2-3 hours.

Overall: One of the only strains I feel s...‚Äù"

Charley_Scheen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1413961,"‚ÄúDon't let the name fool you. Very good strain.  I've been smoking this for a couple weeks now and overall it's a decent high. Not as much of a crazy high I expected. Not a big fan of purp but it really blend the strain. The taste is very pungent but overall a sweet taste the purp really gives you a mellow body high (not too much). The train wreck keeps you very euphoric and very easy to concentrate.‚Äù"
210danks210,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1394849,"‚Äúthe first two times I got this strain I was very disappointed. But this time my local florist gave me a nice batch. Big dense nugs with lots of purple...a shit load of crystals. Lemon taste. Was a very very nice high very relaxed while maintaining a strong sativa type high.. Not for beginners.‚Äù"
newtreehash,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1394850,"‚ÄúAwesome smoke! It starts off with an uplifting happy creative feeling. Then leaves you relaxed and fulfilled. Definitely a great strain for depression and a good nights sleep. I usually smoke it a couple hours before bed and I always get a great night sleep, waking up feeling refreshed. It truly expresses each of its parents.‚Äù"

Sweet, piney, and spicy taste, gives you several hours of feel-good activity before lightly settling you down into a gentle couch-lock.‚Äù"
oneandone,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1410531,"‚ÄúReally enjoyed this strain. You get the best of both sativa and indica varieties.

BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1344712,"‚ÄúI tried a couple versions of Purple Trainwreck for this review. 

A really solid hybrid, if grown right the terp profile is just as impressive as its effects. Great for a bit of Netflix and chill or just chilling watching Netflix.  Keeps the brain turning while sending a euphoric pulse throughout the entire body.  A very relaxing strain but never made me close my eyes, which is something I really look for.  10/10‚Äù"

I didn't feel like I could do much so I just laid down - which made time go by even slower. I think part of the problem was that I did this at noon. I recommend this one for later in the day.

ReeseLikesBud,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1383288,"‚ÄúPurple Trainwreck is some great every day smoke. Never makes you sleepy or lazy. A lot of laughing and a good body high. The bud breaks down really well. I have a couple photos as well.‚Äù"

Tastes like aroma with hash. Expansion is immediate and moderate. Cough is strong but brief. Effect is immediately euphoric and uplifted. Eases into more happiness and relaxation body and mind. Great all day strain for me.
Recommend for creating, frisbee golf, or zoning on a screen.‚Äù"

Feels like I go through it quickly. Smoke a lot for not a lot of payoff. Which I don't like just from the smoking angle. 

If I'm tired at all, it knocks me right out, which I don't really love. I want go at least feel high first, geez. Not terrible, but wouldn't buy again.

Hits you really hard, but then clears up into an amazing, happy, relaxing, euphoric high. I've found it helpful for both daytime and nighttime, but I recommend puffing on some of this before running errands/cleaning/going about your day-to-day tasks, it will leave you happy and floating on a cloud while still being clear-headed.‚Äù"
