amosher13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k1/reviews/1193488,"“I think this may have been a kush heavy phenotype of this strain. Not bad but more stoney and less clear minded than I personally prefer. Definitely happy buzz, just a bit sparkling for work.”"

babachman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k1/reviews/1418202,"“Smells and tastes like pine, like an IPA of weed. Smoked a bowl in the morning and was able to get a few chores done, until I fell asleep watching Rick and Morty and didn't wake up until 3.5 hours later. Smoked another bowl while hiking and got some energy while also feeling a district body high that made me want to be in my bed. I don't believe the weed is worth 5 stars but I'll give it a solid 4.”"
jpwill23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k1/reviews/1158491,"“Good for a one hitter quitter, makes the brain tingle. Smokes very quickly, effects aren't what I thought they would be. Would be good for a cheap grade (even though it's not) and wouldn't mind smoking it again, but won't buy it.”"

SyntaxErr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k1/reviews/1086446,"“Heavy scent before breaking it up.  Upon grinding a wonderful slight chemical smell and a very strong sage smell.  This strain has a distinct cedar scent.

Will definitely review again due to this being the first experience with it.   Creative juices flow almost immediately, wanting to write a full report now.  Must hold myself back.”"
