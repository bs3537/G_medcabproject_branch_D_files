MrKhronicz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1372171,"“One of the first legendary strains, in my opinion, I tried.

I understand highly what it means when they say, "if enjoyed too much, can bring on a deep sleep".
Me and my girl got a bag of this stuff, smelled amazing and was sticky like syrup.
Got home, packed my favourite Yoda bong with a fat bowl, hit it, put a bowl for my girl and she hit it.
The high, I would like to note here, is  almost immediate, but once it st...”"

I've grown her outdoors in the Puget Sound Region and she loves the atmosphere. After the Dark Green Foliage is formed I cut the larger fan leaves to give the bottom some love too. This babe flowers at warp speed without much smell at all. It produces light green flower with the most trichome coverage i've ever seen! After the full plant hang dry and subsequ...”"
SamSimnitt,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1284440,"“DANK!!! Strong aroma, beautiful to look at, covered in white crystals. Smokes well and tastes fine but causes major cottonmouth. After a single bowl my whole body felt relaxed, after 3 bowls I melted into the couch. Perfect for pain relief of any kind, insomnia, and even anxiety!”"
Yodes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1358720,"“Like a bag full of sugar, this strain is covered in crystals.
I recently purchased a lovely roor glass bong (well worth the money) and decided i would try something new, and i tried the legendary leaf it is amazing!!! After my 2nd bowl i started sinking into the couch and then i laughed for a while, and finished off as a struggle to hold my eye-lids up. I would recomend this to anyone who has sleeping problems or un...”"

MelodizeYourLife,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1233750,"“One of my all time favorites :) perfect indica-balanced high not couch locking but uplifting. Years ago she gave me a few expressions-one that tasted like drinking maple syrup, another like eating pancakes. Was a fine yielder as well. If i could grow would get seeds and do the whole garden to find the syrup again. To this day flavor wise only the dj shorts blue from 2000 era can compete-the one that tasted like the m...”"

I smoked this strain in vaporizer and pipe, i think that is better to smoke it in vaporizer because it kicks better and last longer.
Greetings from Mexico :)”"

Treehugger13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1411897,"“One of the best strains I've smoked yet. Definitely a very heavy indica. I just smoked a bowl of this listening to "late night jazz" on Spotify, it's been a great night.”"

Zombiesaint,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1282301,"“Maple leaf was my first high. I felt very relaxed and my whole body had a slight vibration. Wonderful head high with it as well. Smoked one joint 1 gram lasted about 4 hours of complete and total bliss. Like other reviews state this is like having your favorite blanket wrapped around you.”"
spicycolleen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1235360,"“Not only does this smell delicious, it tastes so yummy and fruity. You can smell and taste a strong grape flavor and for me, that's always a plus. Something about fruity strains. This high kinda creeps up on you. The body relaxing happens right away though, and I just sank back into the couch feeling relaxed and warm and happy. Maple Leaf isn't too heavy of a hitter but more than gets the job done. I have nothing bad...”"

Baubesis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1180360,"“This is an ok strain. Hits good and tastes a bit like maple. Kind of gave me a headache though. I had to mix this with some pennywise to offset the headache.”"
quiqueguilarm1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1313738,"“Excellent strain really relaxing,puts you happy, get a deeper sleep, concentration the only that I didn't liked was feeling sleepy, also my eyes were near to close because I am asiactic but I hate that because it makes you look really passed out.
Greetings everyone from Mexico City were they are excellent Kush.”"
oteimages,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1364553,"“I have nick-named this strain, "Night Night" as it is simply exceptional for giving you the best sleep you have ever had. It truly is one of my favorites of all time. Very consistent and the flavor is wonderful and not overpowering. I would call this a "heavy indica" which has obvious medicinal qualities. A truly wonderful companion after a hard day of work. I LOVE this strain . . . you will not be disappointed in th...”"
Funkenstein,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1223847,"“A quality indica strain to say the least. The onset is fast and sedating. It seemed to have an aphrodisiac effect that was smooth and euphoric. Never had it or even seen it before, but I would keep this strain on hand at all times if I could!!”"
ashhh18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/maple-leaf-indica/reviews/1325971,"“Smoked this after I got out of the hospital, and it was pretty decent. More of a strain you'd wanna smoke if you can't sleep though. Didn't help much with my joint pain or the inflammation throughout my body, but I definitely passed out every time I smoked this.
Overall rating would be about a 3.5/5.”"
