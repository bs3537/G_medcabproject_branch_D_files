While many strains are great for exploring the outdoors, they are usually very high-energy Sativas. Well, this one is more  for getting a chair or hammock and just hanging out in a rather meditative at-one-with-nature sort of feeling.

The strength of this strain took me by surprise. It has a very funky smell (hence the name) and the buds are exceedingly sticky..reminds me of Afgoo a bit. 

Love the mind body balance in this one. For me a choice daytime herb to get me through a long work day....or a afternoon movie.”"

GroovyColeman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/deep-cheese/reviews/1325607,"“Definitely tastes like cheese!!! Enjoying a few bowls with some broccoli and cheddar soup lol :) Great head high along with a chill body relaxation, and a full flavored cheesy dense smoke, easy to inhale (flower) NO COUGH. Great smoke in my opinion. Daytime or nighttime, but I can't emphasize enough the cheesy flavor. Head, body effects within 5min, steady 2-3hr effects afterward.”"
