from the Kailua-Kona side of the Big Island of Hawaiʻi!

One of the most sought after Hawaiian strains of all time, and for good reason one hit of Kona Gold will knock you flat like one mean Hawaiian punch, similar to her cousin Puna Buddaz in that respect!

Big Island Pakalōlō (cannabis) is always potent as it has been cultivated with Big Island Love on the worl...”"

    Great Hawaiian Pakalōlō strains like Maui Wowie, Puna Buddaz, Kaua’i Electric and Kona Gold have names, flavors and effects that are universally recognized by Pakalōlō puffers all over the planet, strains that have reached out and touched the world, bl...”"

Sativastalker,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kona-gold/reviews/1399343,"“One hit on MFLB to bliss. A unique high and taste. A happy sativa that is very calming and relaxing without being drowsy. Excellent for Asthma, maybe best so far, need to test more. Poor me. 

Went for a long cold walk in the snow after being sick two weeks and lungs felt great. Still good 3 1/2 hours later. Perhaps my favorite sativa to date.”"

This particular flavor I had the pleasure of enjoying over a period of 5 years, but all good things come to an end and it has now been 10 years since I was lucky enough to have the force of the Knoa Gold lay a high on me SOOOooo thick that I thought for sure I was sitting in a cloud of smoke..er, ah...wait'a minute...”"

lysergikx369,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kona-gold/reviews/1752240,"“Very tropical smelling. It hits sort of harsh like those older strains seem to but it is very energizing and euphoric in it's own way. There's a lower THC count (the Kona Gold I tried was 18.7%) but that means nothing. Very good weed”"
Bobby_3_Kirmil,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kona-gold/reviews/1796668,"“This Konda Gold oil cartridge by Cali Gold is the only sativa strain I've ever been able to actually enjoy. I am HIGHLY prone to crippling paranoia, but this strain gives me a perfect little boost in energy and focus with little to no paranoia depending on my dosing...I sometimes get carried away with it because I like it so much that I make myself paranoid lol Also great for my depression and mood. It makes you feel...”"

AlohaOG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kona-gold/reviews/1361281,"“I have some doubts in regards to the authenticity of this strain as I have 25 years on the Big Island and had only seen the " True" Kona Gold once and it came from the son of one of the
 Old School Kona Growers who was one of a small group of its originators.”"
