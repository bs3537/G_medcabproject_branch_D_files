illbubba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-paralysis/reviews/1343401,"“High: This is by far one of the top indica crosses i have ever tried. Its an extreme muscle lagger but, with a unrelenting burst of energy. Witch instead of one high side-kicking the other they both coexist  witch leads to rather interesting effects.

Medical: its a top of the line pain reliever as well as excellent stress, insomnia, and eating booster.

Taste: can only be described as a superior skunk with an underl...”"

Two hits: am I high yet? Can't tell..
Three hits: can't feel my body
Four: see you in the morning!

The reason this isn't a 5 star high for me is that it makes me do - or not do - things that Make my life harder, like not brush my teeth, sleep with lights on, go to bed with my hair a mess, forget to turn my alarm on, etc. I prefer a slightly more functional high with a little headsp...”"

The phenotype doesn’t always make it purple so growers beware... but the  paralysis part lives up to its name... high af for an hr or 2 and then a smooth strong buzz for hrs after that”"
michael.smith.562343,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-paralysis/reviews/1637749,"“Structurally it's very sativa like with long, thinner but still dense buds. It's flavor is very sweet and unlike any other strain I've tried. Honey like is the closest flavor I could put it at. Effects wise it doesn't hit the same notes as other sativa dominant hybrids but rather behaves like an indica without the extra coma like symptoms. It's a very relaxed, not anxiety inducing kind of feeling. Most suitable for a...”"

holistichippie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-paralysis/reviews/1240160,"“Smells like the grape flavoured lipgloss I used to buy as a kid.😋 

Smooth smoke with a pleasant mocha like finish.  It's got this beautiful fruity & spicy aroma to it. 

This is one of those strains that makes your body and mind relax slowly.  Perfect strain for the end of a stressful day or week.  Would highly recommend this for PMS and PMDD in women!”"
