-Look: Even though it had the standard green bud with orange hairs, it has them in a proportion that has them looking somewhat reminiscent of orange colored citrus

-Smell:  It has a very well rounded bouquet; you have the rich pungent notes of a good strain along with a refreshing and obvious citrus note

-Taste: This has hints of a...”"

Smoking this strain for the first time, I felt like a triumphant alchemist who'd finally found the real 'philosopher's stone', cerebral, rational, and penetrative. 

The moment you inhale this bud, its indica side melts away all mental tension, untangling emotions and thoughts, enveloping the user in a sense of sa...”"

OldToby214,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-dream/reviews/1416085,"“This is a great strain. Tangerine Dream is like being wrapped in the warm embrace of Morpheus. The body is significant enough to relax and relieve stress and fatigue. The head high is slightly overpowering making this hybrid more suitable for activities. Unless you burn down the pipe so to speak. Then it will meld you to the couch. Overall I like this strain it's very pleasant.”"
lovecat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-dream/reviews/1393635,"“This was the most insane tasting bud I've ever had, it literally tasted like someone rolled a joint with orange peels, it was so tangeriney. It was a really smooth, refreshing smoke but it left behind a pretty drastic dry mouth. Definitely worth it though, as the high was bright and clear and left you feeling energised.”"
DabbinMiss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-dream/reviews/1391977,"“Great daytime med for anxiety or depression. Keeps me active and attentive but still with a slight buffer of calmness. Not heady.”"
Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-dream/reviews/1385333,"“Tangerine Dream is a very clear headed high, that can help block pain and reduce stress.  Very citrusy smell, pretty smooth, slightly acidic taste on the exhale.”"
Medithrive,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-dream/reviews/1382879,"“This strain makes me think of Blue Dream in effect, giving you the mellow body with mild indica and a wonderful connected cerebral intensity that allows great focus throughout the day.”"
Deitab,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine-dream/reviews/1393634,"“Tangerine Dream is one of those really nice energetic focused highs but still keeps you grounded, so there is no paranoia.  Real relaxing and mellow at the same time.  I think the best thing about this bud though is the smell and the taste.  Sweet, but not overly sugary.  If you are drinking a soda when you smoke it, it takes on the sugary taste - tasty!!.  One of my fav's.”"

Although having recently had surgery and noticing that this strain was very good for managing the pain, I want to emphasize this strain for people who have pain and stress, but can't handle all medical mj due to anxiety. Some strains cause an anxious reaction in me, but tangerine dream is not one of them. I can smoke, manage my pain, relax and not have an issue. I love it; perfect medicine.”"
