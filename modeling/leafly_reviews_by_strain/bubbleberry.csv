bo0399,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bubbleberry/reviews/1287290,"“I got 4.5 of this stuff. Smells very sweet with bubblegum and berry tones. This was a batch I got from a local dispensary, this stuff was very fluffy, not necessarily fluffy but hollow, airy, crunchy buds. I am not a fan of "leafy" like buds, although it could've been this batch. Nug's are covered in resin and a few orange hairs here and there. When smoking from a bubbler, you get a hit of a sweet blueberry candy mix...”"

Sooptimus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bubbleberry/reviews/1608671,"“People drink straight alcohol because it gets them drunk fast. The issue with that is alcohol by itself doesn't have the greatest taste. This is the marijuana version of liquor. It has a very earthy, dirt-like taste to it. That actually is an understatement, it is a gross swampy taste. At first I was disgusted with the taste of this dope, however I came back to it as the high is incredible. This is one of the better ...”"

Schiz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bubbleberry/reviews/1102260,"“A good break from many of the "staples", this is much more muskily flavoured, more pissy than skunky but a bit lighter than you'd expect, with an aroma to match.  Fairly nondescript, elsewise, besides having somewhat lighter, thinner trichomes than on some other strains such as NYCD or Tangerine Dream.  A solid euphoria, and an nice, swimmy head high that is quite enjoyable and relieves tension nicely.”"

I was disappointed; I noticed very little effect on muscle spasms, and very little psychoactive properties, but had deeply uncomfortably bloodshot eyes and serious cotton mouth.  I don't know whether it was the strain, or those parti...”"
