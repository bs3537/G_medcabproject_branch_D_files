I never had been one for all the hype in assorted flavors and colors in the many forms that marijuana has taken throughout the years. I have always been a fan and still am; OG Kush. It will always be my number one go-to weed. However, Papaya, with its fruity smell as if I am standing in the fruit section at a farmer's market, not...”"

I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering from insomnia! :) I slept like the dead but woke up feeling refreshed and happy. :) It also killed my pain which was a god send.”"
virgocurtis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/papaya/reviews/1152719,"“First time trying this strain and it hit me right away with a good high. It told me that it was medical quality and that I was in good hands. My Tinnitus is happy with this strain with everything nice and quiet like I like it. A real nice head high going on now too. A+”"

NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/indica/papaya/reviews/1223580,"“Very  nice better than expected it tastes alot more of mango than papaya. The smell and taste are really nice and with so many strains to chose from this one's original flavor and smell help it stand out. The Papaya I got had a total THC at just over 18% most of the stuff I smoke these days is in the mid 20s% range but the high on the papaya was just strong it has a great full body high and gets very relaxing perfect...”"

With Crohns that’s a major deal. I feel also happier.  Lmk eyes get a bit heavier but this does ultimately feel more like a hybrid as the mental and uplifting effects are so in your face it’s wonderful. I now feel my muscles 💪 completely relax as I slump into my chair.  I’m smiling and enjoying sharin...”"
StoopidPigeon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/papaya/reviews/1697622,"“I love the sweet/fruity strains for the most part and this one is now on my list of liked. Hits you in the head giving a euphoric cerebral rush but then it moves through the rest of the body providing stress and pain relief in very little time at all. If used moderately you could get away with medicating during the day but its better suited for night time use to the casual user because of the Indica properties. Tight...”"

This was a very pleasant fruity surprise that lives up to its name. An uplifting high that was the first surprise from this Indica, that actually had me giggling like a high school kid smoking their first joint. Cheers”"
Babybeast36282,https://www.leafly.com/indica/papaya/reviews/1780778,"“Not a heavy pot smoker, took one hit and kabam; laughing my ass off over nothing, like rolling around flailing laughing. My body felt foreign, like every time I moved I could sense it way more than I normally could. Then I passed out. For 12 hours. Really intense dreams all night. This is not a daytime strain. This is a when I need to get obliterated strain.”"

GreenGreenWA,https://www.leafly.com/indica/papaya/reviews/1785829,"“sativa ish in the beginning. 1-2 tokes is like viagra for us males. This lasts probably 30-45min along with a playful,happy,carefree attitude of a kid. Then the indica takes over. Waves of euphoria and  hyper relaxing on the muscles,limbs all over.  Also an appetite stimulator even if you just ate a 2lb Filet mignon you're belly feels empty so probably best to invest in some Mom's Making Cookies or Icing on the Cake ...”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/papaya/reviews/1748061,"“One of my new favorites.  Yes it does taste slightly like Papaya. One of the parents, Ice really make this a stoney head high. I am having a hard time describing the uniqueness of this strain....but it is potent, delicious, and lasts a few hours.

If you're getting sick of having the same strains over & over, pick this one up instead.”"

jaredhuffman907,https://www.leafly.com/indica/papaya/reviews/1788951,"“One of the best strains I’ve ever had. The come down is super mellow and the high is great. Super potent (20-25% THC) and the smell and flavor is amazing. Literally smells like pungent tropical sour patch kids. I grew two plants, they were super easy to grow. They grew very fast and very tall. Both reached at least 4 feet in height. Pick up this strain if you get the chance.”"
