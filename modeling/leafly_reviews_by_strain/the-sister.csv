She hasn't put me to sleep, but very relaxed and focused. Great for pain/inflammation. Another winner in my book.”"

Definitely opens the creative doors and gives plenty of energy. With Chem dog supposedly in the mix this strain is a winner in my books.”"

garriswh,https://www.leafly.com/indica/the-sister/reviews/1181524,"“One of my favorite all-around medical strains. Fairly potent Indica-leaning effects that don't leave you too tired. Great citrus-tinged diesel flavor that lingers pleasantly upon the palate. Very nice chemdawg cut I would recommend for day or night use.”"
