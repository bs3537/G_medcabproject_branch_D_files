donigan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/opal-og-kush/reviews/1388571,"“Recently returned to smoking after a long hiatus.  This strain is my favorite.
Almost instant euphoria. This strain is clear headed, and makes me feel energized initially. Also helps me with sexual arousal and performance.
Eventually relaxes like the indica dom it's suppose to be. Unlike others I think this would be a great strain for those new to cannabis , due to no paranoia or memory loss. Versatile strain for day...”"

It was a little dry but exhibited an array of colors and still tasted just like an OG Kush should. This was earthy with hints of lavender.  Very uplifting and almost giggly until the full body high sinks in. It's a clear headed high and would make for a great sleep aid.”"
treelobster,https://www.leafly.com/indica/opal-og-kush/reviews/1383463,"“Picked this up at Top Shelf Cannabis in Bellingham, WA. It was grown by Nine Point Growth Industries indoors in soil in Kitsap County, WA. Harvested 6-2-2014, tested 6-23-14. Moisture content was 5.28%. The buds feature some purple, green, and red colors. It is a hybrid originating from a Frankenstein and Lemon OG Kush. The strain gives a nice, relaxing and powerful effect. Great for focused interest or just relaxing...”"
Kedehn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/opal-og-kush/reviews/1177310,"“Almost like a sativa, though it has a very high Indica content. Very good for feeling creative and euphoric. The good bit only lasts an hour or two, then the indica hits you hard and you just want to lay down. A fantastic strain for work nights. Do some drawing or writing, then put on some headphones and fall asleep. 

This is a great Indica for people who normally smoke sativas 

Bads:
Comes with munchies.”"
ashleymichelle777,https://www.leafly.com/indica/opal-og-kush/reviews/1430368,"“I used to love smoking pot, but I went for years without smoking. recently I started again without doing any research on the type of strain so I had super bad anxiety and felt insecure but only sometimes the rest of the time I cleaned the shit out of my house.
So this time I did some reading and decided to try this. 
It was a great experience I was chill and could relax. I did get sleepy and not much got done but I s...”"

rcbsgirl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/opal-og-kush/reviews/1430557,"“This strain rocks!  I've finally found a herb that really puts me in the zone. The buds are very tight and hard. It has a beautiful deep purple hue with bits of red. The high seems to having an arousing effect along with the intense euphoria it brings on. Definitely don't pass this one up.”"
foxynala,https://www.leafly.com/indica/opal-og-kush/reviews/1298620,"“Pretty standard Indica type strain that has a pretty powerful sedative effect (80% Indica). I found myself relaxed and deep in thought (in a good way). This would be a good strain to use if you need to relieve stress and get some good sleep. In the right setting (for me comfortable and quiet) this may also help with anxiety as it allows one to think deeply and calmly.”"
JagweedMcBane,https://www.leafly.com/indica/opal-og-kush/reviews/1139273,"“Really nice. A single hit on the vape gave me a pleasantly relaxed buzz that lasted an hour before tapering down and leaving me as chill as chill can be for the rest of the day.”"

AasonOrr,https://www.leafly.com/indica/opal-og-kush/reviews/1141302,"“Solid Indica strain that will both relax and lighten your mood. 

Not a good strain if you need to be productive, but a solid strain for a night watching your favorite films, playing your favorite video games or exploring your artistic creativity. 

There's a distinct smell to this bud, keep it wrapped tight or your whole room will smell! 

Highly recommended, probably not a good choice for novice smokers, but vetera...”"
dancingspider76,https://www.leafly.com/indica/opal-og-kush/reviews/1203497,"“This indica herb is lovely. Smells and tastes of sweet, light lemon. The lemony-ness lingers shortly, is not overpowering and just tastes wonderful, great summer flavor. The package description says 'initial thoughtful couch posture' and 'energetic bliss'. I would mostly agree with this.”"
