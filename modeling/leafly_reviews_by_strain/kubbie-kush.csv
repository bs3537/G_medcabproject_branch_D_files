Stoner_mom,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kubbie-kush/reviews/1571245,"“I’ve been a daily smoker for years, and have been having trouble finding an indica that would knock me out for a good nights sleep. Three hits off my bowl of this and I’m feeling it even in my toes. Full body high pretty quickly, and just a general relaxed (but not groggy!) feeling. Love love love!! My new favorite indica.”"
moonstar11187,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kubbie-kush/reviews/1533998,"“( Illinois purchased ) This is an extremely potent strain, at over 27 % THCA , adding the CBD , CBN, and others , this strain come to 30.5%. The highest percent I have ever seen on flower was 32%. That being said it is strong , you will feel a def head high and that “stoned” or couch locked feeling. Don’t smoke this if you have stuff to do that day. In my opinion it’s night time use straight before bed, knock you out...”"

The first thing I noticed was the scent. It literally smells like fruit punch.  It is smooth, and no coughing occurred.  Within a few minutes, I was incredibly relaxed and tired.  

This is definitely a night time strain, but it’s one of the best I’ve had.”"
JuiceDogg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kubbie-kush/reviews/1546416,"“Unique relaxing strain by one of the top cultivators in Illinois- Cresco Labs.   High potency, and lately has been packing 3% CBD as well.    Love the taste, great for end of day.”"
Sunshine0708,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kubbie-kush/reviews/1473912,"“I use this strain to be able to numb my pain with the full body buzz. It allows me to fall asleep very easily to be able to get a great night of sleep. This is one of my favorite night time strains. I love to smoke the flower and I made very good edibles with the shake. The shake is chunky as well which is easy to roll when it's cultivated by Cresco unlike Nature's Grace shake which is very fine.”"
SH21,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kubbie-kush/reviews/1472662,"“This is the 40th flower strain I've tried and the first one to even touch my Fibromyalgia related back pain.  The only bad part, for me, is that it gives me a very strong head high which means I can't really use it unless I'm going to bed because it makes me foggy/fuzzy. I will continue to buy and use this but I'll also be looking for a strain that helps with the pain and allows me to actually function.”"
snappyboo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kubbie-kush/reviews/1600563,"“This strain is stronger than anything else I have tried.  It leaves you completely relaxed with no pain.  Great for nighttime only.  Unfortunately it is also the only strain that I have ever gotten a headache from.  Since the bud tender suggested this I took a chance.  There were no reviews available at that time but now there are.  One of the negative side effects listed (and all side effects are full bar) is headac...”"

I smoked this strain 9 times & each time I smoked it, it caused me to get a throbbing headache, extreme anxiety/paranoia & fear. Even caused me to be irritable/bad mooded. Not because I was mad about purchasing a strain that caused more bad effects than good effects. This strain did absolutely nothing to help curb my...”"

EmotionalMechanic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kubbie-kush/reviews/1725827,"“New Medical patient, PTSD. I tend to shy away from strains that don’t have a majority % of CBD because of anxiety, but when my dispensary was out of my regular high CBD concentrate, I asked for a recommendation and they suggested this in a live sugar format. Tried it last night before bed and it was great. Not overwhelming or heavy; no anxiety; no couch lock. Just relaxed, sleepy, slightly giggly, medicated but not o...”"

I love this Indica by Cresco soooo much just :)”"
Cannabis_Critic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kubbie-kush/reviews/1802227,"“"Mids" by definition. I have tried this strain once and was not impressed at all. Looked pretty good and had a sweet berry aroma but the effects just werent there at all. I tried to get a goodnights sleep off this stuff but it just kept me up. I was expecting sedative indica effects but got little to no effects at all. I smoked/vaped a bunch of this stuff and nothing lol. Lack of nose appeal , low in terpenes either ...”"
