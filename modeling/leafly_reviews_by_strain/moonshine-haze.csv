I use cannabis to treat anxiety, depression, and chronic pain. I tend to go more for hybrids because sativas can give me anxiety. No such problem with this stuff. Zero anxiety, zero paranoia, not racy, just super intense euphoria and comfort that isn't sedating. This will be a staple.”"

Definitely a daytime strain, you don't want to toke this at night, as it feels like an unjittering upper. From now on, this is a must-buy anytime I find it.”"

LostTechnique,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/moonshine-haze/reviews/1233295,"“Amazing strain. One of the best sativas. Very focused with very little anxiety.  Great for daytime use. Not much of a facial buzz, more like a brain instrument. Smell is not overwhelming, so it is easy to pass by, but it has been tested at 29% THC in the best grow environments. Highly recommended!”"

He assured me that despite the high THC content, it wouldn't. That is true, and it is less intense than other strains with similar THC. It is like being covered with a silk scarf.”"
