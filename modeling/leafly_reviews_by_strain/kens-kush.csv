YesDarling,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kens-kush/reviews/1414009,"“I really like this strain, it is best of both worlds. I was recommended this strain by one of my favorite budtenders at The Green Room here in Detroit. I was more or less testing it out being that I got it as a free gram after buying a certain amount and so I always ask the budtender to give me their favorite Indica or Hybrid atm. It has never lead me to a bad strain. 

I wanted to get something done but my stomach a...”"

Nice real dark orange hairs, flower was dark green with shades of purple. when smoked tends to creep up on you, but when it does oh boy. Gets rid of pain, more of a aphrodisiac. made me and my girlfriend horny as fuck. we sat around all day and smoked fucked ate smoked fucked then ate again.
nice bud man!!!
all in all, 5 stars hands down...”"

Most interesting of the 20 or so strains I've done over the years, incredible - basically whatever you do to this plant you're going to end up with decent dense very potent nugs of kush. They get tall and unruly, branch and tangle but the internode spacing is so perfect that 2/3rds of the 3'plant (in 8"pots) gets direct light. This makes the canopy get an unparalleled level of light penetratio...”"

NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kens-kush/reviews/1318586,"“Very nice, extremely relaxing without the sleepy, I would say it leans much more heavily on it's GDP side than the OG Kush side at least in terms of flavor which was okay kinda old school flavored but with a hint of berry but while the GDP brings the relaxation the OG brings something more upbeat hence no sleepy at the same time it doesn't keep you awake and I actually slept very well once I ready.All around a great ...”"

AtomicBrains,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kens-kush/reviews/1321461,"“Got this strain branded as Ken's OG from Royal Tree. Fantastic buds, and great flavor. Mellow relaxed high that has led into significant arousal and absolutely fantastic sex. One of my favorite strains here in Seattle.”"
ThatHighGuy02,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kens-kush/reviews/1516754,"“Has a fluffy feel too it and a fruity smell to it. Burns great but I wouldn’t recommend it to someone who has a taste for stronger and more potent stands such as AK-47 or OG Sour Diesel.”"

Puts a smile on your face, feel good, and horny.

elsyd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kens-kush/reviews/1368252,"“Great overall strain, not sure bout the cat that said theirs had no flavor, I feel sorry for you guys!?!?  Berries-grapes mixed nicely with the OG Kush and sour diesel to really bring out the potent High and delicious terpy!!!! A little anxiety and paranoia but slightly”"

HeadyNugzEWU,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kens-kush/reviews/1287535,"“This is a review of kens kush from Fireline a i 502 producer
The bud was covered in trichomes a light green color.  Very citrusy smell to the buds.  Upon smoking in the waterpipe there is a nice hashy taste with overtones of citrus on your lips.   The high is a high powered kush high not the best for going to sleep for me at least but it is a good day time  strain.”"
BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kens-kush/reviews/1391077,"“This review is on Ken's Kush sugar by Slaughter Genetics out of Colorado Springs, C.O..

I really enjoyed the cross of these three strains.  The GDP really sweetens up the mix and adds a touch of grape. I love grape.  The high itself was comfortable, but I still got a sativa emphasis similar to Sour Kush or Headband but not overwhelming.  I can't speak for the actual herb but it made for tasty oil.  9/10”"
Trippy_skyion,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kens-kush/reviews/1354670,"“I only purchased a pre roll of Ken's kush. I felt like I needed more to feel it's full potential strain effects. Fantastic smell, slow burning. Definitely a strain to recommend if you're by yourself”"
