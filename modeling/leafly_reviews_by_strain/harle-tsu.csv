Normally as I smoke I start to feel stupid, which is a feeling my brain tries to fight, which makes me claustrophobic and overwhelmed.  With Harle Tsu I can take a few bong rips and speak as intelligently as I could if I was sober.  It feels similar to perhaps taking half...”"

For me no anxiety or paranoia.”"

Harlequin gives you a nice pleasant and mild body and VERY mild head high.

Extra good if you get lower intestinal cramping.  Good body buzz relaxes everything in the middle.  

Don't smoke this for a recreational hi because you won't get much of one.  This one is all about the cramping and pain.”"
