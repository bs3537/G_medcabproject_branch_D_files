Mountain Girl is the ultimate for simple, noodling activities.

It tastes and smells lovely and is smooth. Very focused happy high. Did a great job for counteracting anxiety and things like that. I would also highly recommend this one for a novice smoker.”"

Shared a blunt with some co-workers and it was instantly happy/giggly with some serious munchies coming on. Drove to In-N-Out afterward and had a great evening. Would absolutely recommend for those suffering from depression. Paranoia level: 1/10.”"
