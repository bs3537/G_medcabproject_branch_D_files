Selena,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1360142,"“This bud will drop kief on the entire surface you break it over.  It carries a strong euphoric feel, and promotes movement - a very energetic high.   Chocolate Diesel is, by far, my favorite day time medicine.”"

ddtkid101,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1413732,"“I have to say after the first joint i made i realized that this strain has a very thick smoke. I about coughed up my lungs! But after getting used to it i realized that i get a very energetic high. I can smoke a bowl and get enough energy to do a few errands. Not my favorite strain but its inexpensive and elevates your mood so i give it a 4 out of 5”"

deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1383987,"“🍫🐝 Chocolate Diesel is a wonderful little sativa-dominant hybrid with a killer cerebral blast off. It tastes very smooth and chocolatey with an earthy sweetness. It gives you a great burst of energy followed by a not-too-heavy body relaxation that will leave you fully functioning. I would recommend this strain for anything use for anyone trying to get stuff done without getting too blasted. House of Herbs did a nic...”"

DarkEquinox13,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1393470,"“Very potent and covers any surface in loads of keef. Very euphoric and chill feeling. All together happy with this strain.”"
J-Woke,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1393468,"“This is an A+ plus daytime strain. Great taste, very uplifting and not too hazy head high. Be careful smoking at night though if you want some sleep! I tried it for the first time at night and it made my mind race and I was spooked by a stain on my back patio that I thought was a giant spider. But on a sunny Saturday morning it's the bomb.com”"
MaryJuanis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1395134,"“I love this strain. It's nice and sticky so it doesn't burn too fast. It taste really good and it gets me going when I got shit to do. I've never bought the same strain as many times and as consecutively as I have this and the Sunset Sherbert by Twisted Sisters. Ive been smoking on this for two months! Bud Hut has kept it stocked for a minute. 💜💜💜💜”"
mam1173,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1346996,"“This is a really well balanced and strong sativa. Possibly the most well balanced one I've tried. Does have a chocolate scent but the diesel skunk belies it's roots. Nice everyday strain if you can find it.”"
raindeadbutterfly,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1394480,"“I absolutely LOVE this strain. It gives a nutty aftertaste. I was TERRIFIED to try this strain because I have really bad anxiety and saw how bad the "paranoia" is rated on here. Shockingly enough It's one of the best strains I've had for daytime use. Im able to cook and clean everyday without my back pain and I'm able to mellow out but still have energy with my kids. It helps a lot during that time of the month lol”"
webberg,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1347022,"“Very uplifting high, I advise to smoke during the day because it will get you up and going! One of the best strains I've come across”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1751747,"“I don’t like speedy sativas, but chocolate diesel has an exception. A day time strain for sure to pick me up and get me out of any fatigue. I forgot how groggy I was earlier. Now I’m singing and interested in going for a run. The taste is more enjoyable than the high. Sweet chocolate and musky skunk. Aroma is inaccurate on account of lazy growing tech. I got this strain from a grower that I don’t like, and they still...”"
hoskerdude,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1684068,"“picked some up today at cannabis and glass in spokane wa. tested at 29.4 thc, buds have a somewhat immature, stemmy look about it. very pleasant pine/citrus aroma. like all flower purchased legally in WA state in the last couple of years, it was somewhat dry and crumbly (thanks a lot guys). quite impressive from the first hit, I'm feeling quite mellow at the moment. potent enough for those with a high tolerance to th...”"

OffshoreNE,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1362532,"“One of my top 10. Hits strong and quick. Got stuff to do - no problem. Got that event you need to endure? Yep this is the one. Can't say I'm totally crazy on the taste - but the effects are more than worth it. Effects slide off gently over time....”"

bigstephca,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1264043,"“I am not totally into Sativas, but I did enjoy this strain for its terp and aesthetic properties.  The eighth I received was well cured and the bud was huge and weighed three grams.  Skunk and diesel are very prominent in taste and smell.”"

I’m trippin trippin really, the sativa KICKS. also the fastest the high has ever hit me. Peak highness is stretched out long. I suggest coming down by sleeping. Conscious come down isn’t comfy”"

This vortex has got my mind spinning in multiple directions. Deep inside the vortex lives the happiest version of you. It’s the version that you want to show, but people don’t like that part of you! Well, let me tell you to let that person shine and elevate your frequency to out of this galaxy. Deep feelings of chilliness and mind openness.”"

Lorialo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1719225,"“One of my favorite sativas.  When I can get chocolate diesel, I get it.  This will get you pumped, amped, and sometimes a little giggly.  This strain is an "I can conquer the world" type of strain even when taking the time to sit and relax.  Also if you want a libido boost -- here it is.”"
Venice29,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-diesel/reviews/1729362,"“This strain is amazing.  I procrastinate a lot from my anxiety and panic attacks.   This strain is a "just do it" "no fear" miracle weed.  I'm energetic but chill and happy.  I can feel like a productive human being.  

The best part is that my favorite dispensary is practically giving this strain away.  I got 6 grams for $30 dollars.  If you're a medical marijuana user, Chocolate Diesel will be your go-to daytime st...”"
