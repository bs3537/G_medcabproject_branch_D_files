flipndip187,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-creamsicle/reviews/1416280,"“This strain is really a masterpiece when it comes to presentation. Bright yellow and green buds covered in orange hairs and white trichs, and ooozing and delicious floral creamy orange smell that even non weed smokers love(no lies). The taste its just as appealing, leaving you with dead on imaitation of an orange creamsicle on every exhale. The high is a very mellow relaxing high. Not overly powerful, but not unpoten...”"

I'm WAY more high than I wanted BUT I'm also not freaking out or weed sick so it's cool.  It's an energizing high and it tastes SCRUM~DIDDLY~UMPTOUS!   I wanna marry this bud.”"
HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-creamsicle/reviews/1412094,"“Orange Creamsicle is definitely among my favorite sativa-dominant hybrids. This is a perfect strain for those looking to be productive and creative while in motion. Take a toke and get ready to cook, clean, put things together, or give your partner a massage. This strain is supposed to ease anxiety, so those searching for a nice tension-free high should put some of this in the air. Orange Creamsicle has loads of oran...”"

A smooth smoke with a taste of vanilla on the exhale, OC has made the list of one of my very top favorites.  I originally got it to see how it would work for the inflammation from my osteoarthritis, and it works wonderfully for that, too.  Definitely a must try strain for anyone dealing with depression, anxiety, or inflammation and pain!”"
ajr819,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-creamsicle/reviews/1355031,"“I got this strain because I wanted pot that wouldn't make me feel tired. The bud I bought from cbcb in Berkeley, CA seems a little old, but it still did not give me the "stoney" effect the way lots of stale buds do. Everything seems a little faster with this one, making it great for creativity and focus. This will not leave you feeling sleepy. It is great for a day smoke.”"
tristan....,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-creamsicle/reviews/1376051,"“Orange Creamsicle is a solid hybrid and every definition of the term. It gives me a relaxing cerebral high that caused some "deep thoughts". But then after about the 3-5th bong rip the indica half of the hybrid started to show its effects. Not an overwhelming couch lock but enough to satisfy most Indica lovers.
 I've gotten the strain from local dispensaries in Arizona, and if grown properly I'd give the strain 4/5. ...”"

This bud will take you places, anywhere from a trip down memory lane to a trip around your house to a trip across the universe. Such an incredible taste, literally like the very popsicle itself. Where I am right now (off a king sized spliff) is better than I have ever felt right now, this bud brings me truly closer to myself, the world, the universe, and beyond.”"

Outrageously appealing smell of citrus and earth. In my Pax 2 the taste is very mild, bordering on non-existant, probably making it a good starter strain for novices. What is interesting is the after-taste...the citrus pleasantly lingers and it is really tasty at that p...”"

The taste, the aroma, the texture of the buds, the beautiful presentation of orange and green. When smoked in a joint or one hitter, you can really taste the strong tropical flavor, actually reminiscent of a orange creamsicle pop, or more seeming more similarly to me as a glass of orange juice.

As a daily user, I'm always on the lookout for something that will heighten my senses and motivate me to be active and experience things vs. just a sedating effect which would give me solid sleep.

IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-creamsicle/reviews/1374628,"“Really calming and uplifting. Great smelling and smoking hybrid. Good balance of effects that fade from sativa type to indica type without being overly sedative. Up there with more known hybrids like girl scout cookies and cherry pie. Definitely worth checking out.”"

Mine was tested at 10.7 thc.
The buds were just above mids, nice orange hairs with just a bit of tri coverage. The scent of the bud is citrus with a bit of sweet and woodsy smell.

The high is great! Very mellow, mainly head but a healthy dose of body high.
It energizes you, but not in a speedy kind of way, and you're nice and focused and happy.

Never had a strain taste so good in our experiences as cannabis testers.  

5 stars all the way.

Best flavor,
Creamy & smoothe,
Great terpenes,
Great medical benefits 
Feels like a sativa without any Anxiety and treats pain & tremors like an indica

Not to mention, 
Creamy and flavourful on the taste buds”"

THC total : 66.19 %. CBD total : 0.39 % 

Although it's called Orange Creamsicle, it reads as : 
The flavorful combination of Tangie & Vanilla Kush . 
A perfect hybrid for day or night . 

The taste is yummy 😋 , it does taste just like orange creamsicle !!! 
A few dabs of this at lunchtime, and I'm ready for an afternoon of just about anything ! 😊👍...”"
