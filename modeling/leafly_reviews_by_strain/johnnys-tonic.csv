I was skeptical about the strain at first but after smoking, the effects almost immediately kicked in. If you are looking for a chill yet very focused strain, this is the ONE!

I have smoked for 10 years and recently have had horrible anxiety/paranoia from high THC strains. Johnny's Tonic has 0 paranoia and still has a pleasant high. I would compare it to taking an anxiety pill except even better. Very happy, will be buying this strain all the time now!”"

Recently prized for its exceptionally high thc content (up to 28%) and cbd as well (as stated in its description). It was very quick, I should have grabbed more while I could. Very good for pain and anxiety. Very, very good.”"
