MMPRCanada,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bedica/reviews/1391840,"“This is s great overall strain. As an MMPR it is only available from an LP. Bedrocan products are available from Tweed. It had a nice Orange appeal to it. it gave great pain relief uplifting and creative uplift. Will definitely go with this more often.”"
MMPRCanada,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bedica/reviews/1391838,"“This is a great strain. Produced by Bedrocan, a Canadian LP. They are very consistent in potency it is rated 17%THC. < 1%CBD. Its more important to note the BCP content of this strain. The HIGH is of minimal concern as the over effects dominate. As an MMPR this is going to be my main strain. No need to experiment and overtime my body will override the high THC content, Medicinal User.”"
CrashT,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bedica/reviews/1391837,"“Bedica is a very good smooth strain from the LP Bedrocan.
I was very pleased with this strain. It has europhic properties, clean smoke, nice full flower buds, and a appropriate price tag.
I use Bedica (Afghani × Herijuana) in the morning, afternoon or evening before bedtime.
I found no panic or anxiety at all from this 17% THC, <.01 % CBD strain.
I enjoy smoking marijuana OG Style in a joint format.
Mixing Bedica 50/...”"

I have tried both the  17% & 20% THC versions of Bedica and they are great strains to relieve pain and insomnia. Many people complain about the smell of their buds but I like the smell...very floral and sweet (smells tasty). Overall good strain for evening & nighttime use :o) Beware though, causes a very dry mouth!!”"

This strain is 17% THC, <1% CBD. WILL ORDER AGAIN :)”"
dtown902,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bedica/reviews/1391843,"“Does the job very well. I medicate mostly for sleep and I have almost no complaints. Does make your mouth a little too dry, but what weed doesn't do that to some extent?”"
Havamal,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bedica/reviews/1391842,"“I medicate for sleep, joint pain and stress related injuries, the 17% does the job for me.

Maybe that is Afghani in it. I love indicas this is 14% I do perfer stronger ones especially at night. It helps with my pain, stress and anxiety and slows down tons of thoughts. AT night it helps me sleep. I like all of Bedrocans products so far that I have tried. Higher the THC better for me.”"

Labman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bedica/reviews/1342355,"“Great strain when you can get it, calming with out too much cloudy effects. Flower version only just became available today after long absence. Bedica is a surprising indica strain with a medium high THC % giving the lift of a Sativa with a calming indica feel . Bedrocan is a reliable and efficient LP they offer great pricing but a limited selection.”"
kupcake75,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bedica/reviews/1367192,"“Order this from my Lp and love it . Definetly does the trick, I recommend you try it.”"
