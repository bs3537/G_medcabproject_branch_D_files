I'm not stupid high but more of a relaxed, sensational, up spirited feelings. Definitely could see why it would be a sativa. I'm probably going to go write a book, feeling very inspirational and creative. This should be called God bud. I feel content with everything thing. I can't wait to get more or even ge...”"
mamad0420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/og-la-affie/reviews/1332232,"“This is one of the parent strains of LA Confidential, which is one of my favorite indicas.  It has that pungent Afghani smell & taste I love so much, & is beautifully grown.  It is a consistent, long lasting high that is more functional that a lot of other indicas.  It brought me up & down nice & easy.  I had never heard of this strain before, but will keep an eye out for it now!”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/og-la-affie/reviews/1416837,"“Strong body high with an clear headed, euphoric calming cerebral effect. Effects make for a good sleep aid without the heavy sedated feeling you get with some indicas. Good during the day too, goes from relaxed and giggly to deep thought/conversation type stuff.  Taste/scent is spicy and herbal very similar to Bubba or LA Confidential.”"

FireMarshallBill,https://www.leafly.com/indica/og-la-affie/reviews/1448628,"“Another homerun by DNA genetics ... starting to come around again after a hiatus. Tastier and stronger than LA confidential, but both are prime examples of why Cali bud blows competition out of the water. This one will land you on your ass if you're not a pro!”"
tdogII,https://www.leafly.com/indica/og-la-affie/reviews/1583986,"“This is a brilliant Indica! Surprisingly there's no couch lock effect that usually accommodates the heavy body buzz you get with this strain. Instead you're very uplifted almost energetic yet you keep the hefty body relax feel you get with great indicas. This blend helps to create a very nice focused effect that makes it easy to accomplish tasks if in the mood all the while that dense body buzz is relaxing the bodies...”"
Bakedaylee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/og-la-affie/reviews/1546640,"“All I gotta say is 🔥🔥🔥

Awesome strain, I actually don't feel bad spending $10-$15 a gram on some LA Affie! Hits really nice. Good head high and pain relief within five minutes. Lasts a little longer than your average "top shelf" choices as well. I would highly recommend you try some and see how you like it!”"

lvdiva,https://www.leafly.com/indica/og-la-affie/reviews/1512212,"“Good strain - pain is gone. Numb and sitting outside myself. Feel light headed (and hungry). Fun to watch tv on - hyper focused but eyes are heavy. Neat. Like this strain a lot!”"
1kushking,https://www.leafly.com/indica/og-la-affie/reviews/1699278,"“Gave this strain a try when i saw it was the parent to LA Confidential OG. Got nice Indica effects from it making me happy, relaxed, & then sleepy. Firm moist light green buds with 18% THC & dark orange hairs. Taste & smell of sweet citrus & earthy coffee. Enjoyable strain worth experiencing :)”"

the420connoiseur,https://www.leafly.com/indica/og-la-affie/reviews/1213267,"“What can I say, an amazing flower. Tastes great and knocks the hell out of pain, but it doesn't couch lock you.  First time I had it instantly went into my top 5 strains.  Can't say enough about it.  I have extreme arthritis and this does a heck of a job helping me get through it.”"

Tons on tricomes on these solid little nuggets. 27% THC this isn't for beginners. Good before bed, shuts me right down but in a good way. When I want to get stoned this is the first jar I reach for.”"

Great indica, smooth on entry and exit, very comfy, warm, relaxed feeling. Great for body ailments. 
Very good strain, I recommend this strain for indica lovers. Really helps relax. Helps the wife with her RLS.”"
