khaze379,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-og/reviews/1562794,"“I usually stick to a sativa for the obvious reasons, I like a indica on a very rare occasion-only before bed, if any at all. But I like this one. It gave me a giggly feeling and definitely eased my headache. I actually was able to work (fast paced, hard labor) and not feel sluggish. Definitely will keep this one around for a while. Oh! And it smells and tastes like chocolate 😁”"
JSW735,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-og/reviews/1394641,"“A little toke goes a long way but, if you want to get all couch slap happy it will take you there.”"
Sp7,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-og/reviews/1651801,"“Wow! This has a magnificent aroma! You get the sweetness of a coffee like smell with a nutty finish. I even get a bit of a cheesy note at the end.Now take it easy and it's an uplifting and focused strain. Go heavy and it's going to get you stuck on the couch or down for a nap. Buds are big, dense, and covered in trichomes. A+”"

BloodBunny,https://www.leafly.com/indica/chocolate-og/reviews/1689506,"“Well... I don't know what it is about this strain, but after 5ish hits of this from a cartridge it makes me super bed-locked and euphoric, which ends up turning me on. Definitely a stress and depression reliever. 😆 Also has a pleasant taste.”"
