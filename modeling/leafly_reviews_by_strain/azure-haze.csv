cheecho2884,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/azure-haze/reviews/1413523,"“One of my favorite strain out there. It gives you a hazy, euphoric and time skipping high and mellows down to a nice chillax, slow paced ready to jump on the bed and see you tomorrow morning buzz.”"

Lavender18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/azure-haze/reviews/1348682,"“Nice strain to smoke when you need to relax. Good for those stressful days.  Smooth hits with a sweet berry flavor. Also good for getting your appetite going. I will add this strain on my "Go To" strain in the future.”"

but great strain two thumbs up in one sedated foot up.😎”"
sburns12,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/azure-haze/reviews/1341517,"“After smoking a one-hitter bowl the high took about 5-10 mins to creep in. High starts off somewhat focused and energetic. After 15-20min the high becomes heavy and sleepy. Serious munchie cravings with this one. Perfect for watching a tv show before bed with a bowl of popcorn.”"

rUcereal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/azure-haze/reviews/1304870,"“Smells very nice, tastes okay, burns well too. Even with a lower THC content of its parents, it certainly delivers a Haze. Maybe a little too hazy and too sleepy for me.”"
TheRadiator101,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/azure-haze/reviews/1300288,"“Picked some of this off recently, the smell was blue berry with hints of classic haZe nothing to special but potent. The taste ranged from dank blue cheese to blueberries, soothing high munchies for sure”"

tlultuce,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/azure-haze/reviews/1355110,"“Cracking it open smells like straight blueberries, its insane! Nice high, nice flavor, and pretty active, what more can you ask for? Perfect.”"
ChrisMacDowell,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/azure-haze/reviews/1301980,"“Pre Roll. Had a sharp, earthy-berry flavor, with some cheesiness in there, if I remember correctly. Interesting flavor profile. Smoke was smooth. Was only 17%, but I felt relaxed enough for 30 minutes until I had a few errands to run. Was not very effective for my public anxiety. Not bad, overall.”"
CaptCronics,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/azure-haze/reviews/1352903,"“Very strong diesel Taste when sparking up a bowl. If your looking for a sweet, fruity taste this is NOT your strand. This is a diesels fan favorite. I like more sweet and fruity so that's why i give it 3 stars.”"
