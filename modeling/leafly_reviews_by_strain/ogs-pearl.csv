DurnSmokely,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ogs-pearl/reviews/1157633,"“I've only been smoking for about a year, but pretty much always a different strain... & this is by far the dopest dope I ever smoked. I bought 2 grams of this stuff from new vansterdam and would definitely consider buying it again. the smoke is smooth and the taste is flowery. it comes on strong and lasts long. not the best weed to smoke if you just wanna smoke a little and get some sleep though. I found it got my mi...”"
Redacted,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ogs-pearl/reviews/1084733,"“Picked up a couple grams at New Vansterdam in Vancouver, seriously considering making the 4 hour drive back for more, that's his good it is. Very heavy throughout the body, not really any cerebral effects to speak of, but without  any couchlock. Very mellow. VERY good for pain, onset within a minute or so, lasted for a couple hours on one bowl. Serious munchies too.”"

drewskie777,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ogs-pearl/reviews/1151092,"“Tastes terrible! High was short and not very enjoyable. From the picture they supplied you can probably tell that it low grade. Said the thc level was 17 percent. I highly doubt that. Go another way if at all possible. Actually all products I have tried from nine points are sub par! Step it up if you are producing for legal shops! The price is already too high!”"

Hanover-Fist,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ogs-pearl/reviews/1084732,"“Used a vaporizer; didn't pick up the flavors as much.  No after taste, no burning sensation and it expanded inside my lungs.  Effects build up nicely in a short period of time.  Not overpowering.  I could still function fully but didn't have any desire to jump up and run errands.   This gave me the impression of just chill, relax, and watch a movie.  Smoked in the evening about 3 hours before going to bed.  No proble...”"

chris99102,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ogs-pearl/reviews/1299347,"“Has a great aroma, what we tried was very earthy. Amazing if you like sweet back hit on your tongue. There was a good focused head high, and the body night was very light. Eliminated chronic back pain immediately, but it was not too heavy like other hybrids.”"
