A-Dub

JohnnyBear420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-dub/reviews/1337464,"“Picked up some A-Dub from Shango Las Vegas. I honestly picked it up at first only because of its high THC content, testing in at 30%. My body felt completely relaxed after the first drag, not couch locked though (then again I am a heavy smoker). You can definitely feel and taste it's OG genetics. Pine, lime and gassy aromas and flavors burst out of these dense nugs when ground. Definitely getting more of these tasty,...”"

Kingrat-OG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-dub/reviews/1464653,"“I purchased this strain as a replacement for Bio-Jesus, since I can’t find any more of my ‘fav’ in the Las Vegas Valley.  A-Dub smells like a cross between a lemon and a nondescript but sweet garden flower.  The smoke was very mild, had a woodsy flavor to it, and was easy on the lungs.  I used it before going to bed last night.  It provided me with a strong pain free indica high, with small cerebral undertones.  It a...”"

It was a solid strain but it lacked in a true knock out punch (we were told it was a powerful indica). This would be a great concert strain or maybe a fun walk in the woods. The taste was pleasant and nothing too harsh. I would try it again but I would try to get it at a be...”"
greeneyeganja.girl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-dub/reviews/1356421,"“A hybrid flower, A-Dub has dark orange tiny hairs curled into the trichomes, giving off a straight lemon pepper tart aura. When smoked, (I used my little bubbler for this strain) the softening of your stresses literally? pulls through the hit like a genie in a bottle cloud that pulls over all of you. This potent relaxation blankets over your whole face with a dissolving buzz and ever so slightly sinks into your toes....”"

transgreaser,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-dub/reviews/1312176,"“This strain overall, is a firm "meh." 

Although purportedly 33% THC, I can only assume the other traits, most notably  CBNs (up, focused) and CBDs (calming, healing) have been weeded out... for lack of an actual scientific term. :) 

Genetically modified to elevate THC levels and remove seemingly ancillary traits?  

I really am a longtime noob, so my lingo. Ahem. 

The taste of it is also meh. 🤓

When I was on this kicker, I was absolutely jogging, I mean this was one of the greatest experiences of my life and one that I cannot wait to try again. It felt like a completely different ballgame in terms of taste, smoothness, and overall results. Just all round a very nice strain.”"
NoCo970,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/a-dub/reviews/1359430,"“This is a great daytime strain. Flavor is very mellow and would consider it earthy, slightly woody, but also has a little zest at the very end that seems almost menthol/minty, but this is very very faint and wouldn't be noticed unless vaping. This strain helps relax me, but doesn't have much of any pain relief. Can be felt behind the eyes and in the face (love this feeling). Helps with depression, stress, and most of...”"

I have nothing negative to say about this strain. It helps me with my  anxiety, appetite, insomnia  and chronic pain.. it keeps me calm and with having anxiety, that' it is key to have a strain that helps with all these symptoms.  The smell and texture give gives it a dense bud which I like, a little goes a long way. Definite...”"

Just right in all the right places. My nose is stuck in the jar. Tasty off the bong. Instant relief. No tension. Just cuts in. Happy. Very good head high. Not too lifty but high in the clouds. The flower was so nice looking I didn't want to smoke it. I'm glad I did.”"
