I picked this up from Good Meds Lakewood and I'm telling you that those growers know what they're doing. This is a stone I will remember for a long time. heady, heavy, relaxing, and very euphoric all at the same time. what a dank smoke. pick this up if you ever come across it, it's some fire.”"

After 4 or 5 puffs...life is good!  Only half dumb, nearly pain free (8/10 reduced to 4/10), anxiety free & melted into my heavenly seat.  A creeper & a keeper!!!!”"

I really love this strain because it's really one of the most indica indica strains I've tried. Effects were a intense body high that left me feeling sleepy and happy. Smell was on point, a very pungent cheese scent. Buds were quite unique looking, dense and a very dark purple green. Highly recommend!
Connoisseur”"
ClassOf98,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cheddar/reviews/1375651,"“One of the best tasting strains I've ever smoked. Rich wine and cheese flavor comes through on every last hit. The high itself is great for stress and pain relief as well as loss of appetite. The Herbal Cure is where I always grab it. Outstanding.”"

Spasticnoodle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cheddar/reviews/1348603,"“Powerful.  After vape session I started having vertigo, which is one of my MS symptions.  I don't use sleep meds, because they often do this too.  Next time I will only use about 3 hits of this strain on the vaporizer.  Good strain for folks who want to get an old fashioned shit faced high.  At my age, I prefer to be a bit more functional.”"

lilSt0ney,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cheddar/reviews/1509677,"“I would rate this strain of 4.5 or a five star I only smoked one bowl out of it and it put me on my ass. I was relaxed and all my pain in my back was gone. Definitely something to try if you have chronic pain.(Down Side) cotton mouth, munchies other then that one of the best strains I have had and I would definitely recommend.”"

curtnevan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cheddar/reviews/1349822,"“I'm really jealous of you guys! I chose PC based on reviews, and what I got looked beautiful. But where it counts, it's taste and potency were disappointing. Not bad, but not special and not very potent. Oh well!”"
guanope,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-cheddar/reviews/1293866,"“I absolutely dig so much about this strain. The smell is delightful, the taste is deliciously cheesy with a hint of sweet, and a little of it went a hell of a long way. I felt so relaxed that I swear I time traveled, and it made dinner magical. I strongly recommend this one if you want a nice evening... emphasis on nice.”"
