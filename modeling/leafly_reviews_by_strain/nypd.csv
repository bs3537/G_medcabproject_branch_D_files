NYPD

hollyc,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1375515,"“Jacked me up a little at dinnertime while cooking dinner. I think energetic and uplifter and focused would describe well but more goofy then anything... I'll have to smoke again and review right after.”"
pineapplekyle,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1375508,"“NYPD, or New York Power Diesel is a fantastic sativa. As I smoke I get a burst of relaxation followed by the sudden interest of everything around me, and deeper into the high I get what I can the "classic high". Any experienced sativa fan will enjoy this and possibly choose to keep as the main bud of choice.”"
swerve420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1375510,"“A very enjoyable, uplifting, yet very manageable high. Great in a social setting and for a good comedy movie! Expect to talk and laugh a lot! :D”"
cannabisgrowerhr,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1375509,"“This is one of my new favorites. Great for social environments without being racy like some Sativa strains. I've been using this strain with friends around the campfire jam sessions”"
Septi,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1370842,"“TL;DR: Great strain to go through the hard times, or just to prime yourself for some serious action.

Great uplifting feeling, very energizing. When I vape it, I don't want to sit around and think, but happily engage in some activity: socializing, playing games etc. Watching a movie also goes great with this one. But if I want to just sit down and contemplate my life, I become bored very quickly.

About 1:20 hours la...”"
503bomb,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1311660,"“this strain is wonderful . as a big fan of sativas / sativa dominant hybrids this strain was perfect for me.  that exciting euphoric almost caffeine like rush but balanced out nicely with the indica providing mild pain relief as well.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1588918,"“There are so many variations of diesel strains, each surprisingly different from each other.
Power Diesel brings out your creativity, it does give you energy but not like the way most Sativa's feel like. 
Has an earthy taste as well as diesel. 
I picked up this strain in live resin, super strong. Use caution if prone to anxiety, I never get that as a side effect but others might due to it's potency.”"
simaen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1370843,"“It figures that the only strain in recent memory that reminds me of those friends and acquaintances who say pot makes them really paranoid would be called NYPD. What others call paranoid, I usually consider more detachment, which sativas sometimes spur. Good sativas always have that kind of detachment feeling, but in the form of energetic euphoria. Bad sativas just make you dizzy, like a police officer bonking you on...”"
JoePes,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1203133,"“I would really only give it 3.5 stars if I could. its a good strain to work on if you don't get those obvious signs of smoking i.e bloodshot eyes. I got mine from main street marijuana in Vancouver Washington. it tested under 20 percent so I think it would be good for sophomore smokers. it's taste was earthly but pleasant. I smoke mostly to get out of pain and put me in a good mood. this is great for a mood elevator ...”"
bbwburner,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1208443,"“Makes me dizzy every time. Like when I first started smoking kinda high. Only $15/gram”"
veryweed,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1204938,"“picked up some 95 percent shatter that really got me medicated. great strain great vibes”"
BakedFreshDaily,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1559375,"“Every time I smoke NYPD it makes my lungs feel very tense and its VERY uncomfortable. If a strain was to give me a panic attack it probably would be this one. With that being said, if you do not experience any discomfort with this strain, It can be a really nice high. Not for me though.”"
kurtmevans,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1391747,"“potent taste and smell were both misleading not an intense high.  I have not found a diesel that i have really appreciated so far.”"
faebae,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1311661,"“tried this in a preroll and it was pretty tasty. truly a sativa dominant strain with quite the punch. very uplifting and not left in a couch lock. can get stuff done and stay focused throughout my day. highly recommend”"
HerbOctavianLabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1450431,"“NYPD. Good for stress. Creative and stimulating while not being too buzzy. A good strain to get some house cleaning done.”"
MPhelps,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1364603,"“No joke 92% activated thc dab and I'm gonzo 10 minutes of not breathing totally worth it!”"
bigbuddhaboy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1265937,"“Very nice! Pleasant smell and taste, lovely effects. This is a great sativa options for those who don't typically enjoy sativas.”"
gloryhaze,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1305381,"“I really wanted to be impressed with this strain but just was wasn't. My go-to store was out of any full Sativas really so I gave this a shot. 
One, it tastes awful. 
Two, it wears off fast, and heads straight into headache land. 
While the buds are dense and pretty this is just not a strain I will be heading towards again anytime soon. Headache every time.”"
flowerbender,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1453402,"“Tried this NYPD from Rogue Raven farms. It didn't smell too much like a sativa-lacked that sharpness to it. The buds were nice and sticky which I liked. The effects seemed to lean more towards a balanced hybrid than a sativa but it was definitely one you could "get-up-and-go" on!”"
MagicMonkey,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1213184,"“Nothing exciting about this dull sativa. Others have noted that it smells better than it smokes or tastes. I tend to agree. With so many other sativa's to choose from, I'll pass next time.”"
jdt322,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1364039,"“The lab NYPD is the 🔥 creeper and tastes amazing”"
pottypotterson,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1202988,"“decent sativa hybrid. definite mind high, with a nice pain relieving numbness that you would expect from an indica.”"

MoakeeMoak,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1205375,"“This strain sounds very horrific to the ears, but it sounds like a trier.”"
sangria80,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1586186,"“Fun! Does have a diesel vibe going. Helpful for focus, energy, workouts, etc. Pretty potent too. I liked it. Having said that, it seems lacking next to Sour D and many other zippy "sativa"-ish strains. I enjoyed it, but probably won't buy on repeat.”"
blueseas69,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1648391,"“really chill, high focus, just a nice feel good, at ease feeling”"

Carpetbagger,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1573997,"“NYPD does have a funky diesel aroma and a nice balanced high, on the cerebral side, good stuff.”"

Cappydanky,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1721142,"“Awesome thick head high smooth funk throughout the WHOLE body”"
WeAreTheWildThings,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1631942,"“Maybe it's the batch I have of it. It looks amazing. But it tastes so much like a orange/tangie/jillybean type strain to me. I'm not a fan of that flavor profile.
I wonder if the dispensary has Tangie Biscotti mislabeled? If not, this isn't a strain for those that aren't fans of orange zest flavor.
The high is mellow and relaxing, slightly cerebral.”"
JotaroFloyd,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nypd/reviews/1688081,"“This is a beautiful strain for: relieving physical and emotional pain, making you goofy, jacking off, snacking, playing video games, listening to music, etc.

There isn't a problem with it otherwise, other than the general cottonmouth that comes with any partaking. However, it's not much in comparison to other strains like Trainwreck in my opinion, though definitely some top tier shit. Honestly, after about 4 or 5 pu...”"
