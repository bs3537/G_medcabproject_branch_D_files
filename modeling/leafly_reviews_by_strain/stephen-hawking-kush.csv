I really like this strain. The effects on me are that it provides a very mellow high and totally relaxes me. I medicate with Cannabis for PTSD, Anxiety and Insomnia 

The high last about 1.5 to 2 hours and then once the high is gone, my thinking is very calm and clear....”"

First off the buds are beautiful fluffy multi colored nugs of greens, pinks, and purples, frosty white trichomes cover every inch of this stuff. It smells quite sweet and tastes quite a bit like it smells kinda like minty, black cherry, with maybe a little e...”"

This is a go to strain for playing video games, watching movies, chores, hiking etc! It doesn't leave you couch locked but instead it gives you quite the opposite effect. It gave me a boost of energy and made me want to be active! I highly recommend this strain!”"

It's effect is mellow and soothing. It won't transport you to the ethereal like a good sativa, but it will erase the very memory of pain and make amenable the most ornery dispositions. And it gets nice purple highlights around day 40. Combined with a sativa ripper, the secret of the golden flower just m...”"

I've smoked SHK twice now and I'm really liking it. No paranoia (b/c low THC) and pain & migraine ease (b/c high CBD). Lasted 2.5 hours. I went on a walk, laid on a bench and watched the clouds. Very mellow start, calming, transitions to focus and uplifted-ness. Very clear high. No couch-lock.”"
Scortchblue,https://www.leafly.com/indica/stephen-hawking-kush/reviews/1305596,"“This is my first real take on rhis strain as I decided to go beyond my comfortable baked zone.
So there is definitly pain relief and a definite fog on the brain, you will react slowly. Sleeping is weird. I wanted to but noises kept waking me up. I have PTSD so the flashbacks and reactions stopped but the emotional was still there. My nervous twitches were still happening even though I was chill. It's very complicated...”"
rowcat,https://www.leafly.com/indica/stephen-hawking-kush/reviews/1316257,"“I asked for a strain that would not allow anxiety to flare up and would ease me into a nice, relaxed sleep. This one delivered as promised! I don't get super high, but I love the gentle lull into a sweetly mellow state. I felt cuddly and warm and and secure between all my blankets and pillows on my bed right before I fell asleep! I would highly recommend this one to anyone who need to feel at ease.
Plus, it's named a...”"

Absolutely Smiles and TOTAL RELEIF are endrenching me in this dream. My love of indica just got greater because I have had a crush on Stephen Hawking and now I can smoke bud named after his fine ass and mind. WOW I think this strain will make me more intelligent. It is so much stonier and higher than I thought it ...”"

I picked up a couple of grams of this yesterday at Dockside Cannabis in SODO based on the recommendation of one of the bud tenders. This bud took me on a wonderful ride that started in sativa land and gradually descended into indica land. It was the end of the day for me so i really appreciated the soft landing. Had I been more energetic I feel that this strain would have been helpful in being creativ...”"

My 1/4 was raised and harvested by Pruf Cultivar, a PDX grower associated with Electric Lettuce. The CBD : THC ratio is roughly 10% : 7% on this predominantly indica hybrid. 

This is the perfect flower to keep on hand when you've had a bit too much cannabis, and you're starting to feel anxious and paranoid. I had happened to have one too man...”"
NoPoWanderer,https://www.leafly.com/indica/stephen-hawking-kush/reviews/1389807,"“BEST CBD strain I've tried so far.  Many CBD strains have the downside of being a little edgy (for me) so it nice to find one that had a lovely mellowness to it, maybe because it's crossed with an indica? Whatever the case may be - it eased my joint pain and put me in a good humor. The buds are lovely and frosty looking. THC is low - around 4% but I still caught a nice buzz. Very soothing.”"

I do get distracted a bit, but only because I haven't felt this good in a while. Adjustments to the dose, and this is a sweet CBD happy camper. Yes indeed.”"

juicyfruitseuss,https://www.leafly.com/indica/stephen-hawking-kush/reviews/1169442,"“I found this train to be quite enjoyable. About 2 minutes after my second hit I had a mild to medium buzz and was feeling both relaxed and interested in my surroundings.

10 minutes in a good body high had blossomed and my mind was still clear enough for projects and attention dependent activity.”"
soccermom,https://www.leafly.com/indica/stephen-hawking-kush/reviews/1202107,"“This might be my favorite go-to strain for pain issues.  Really knocks out the pain from headaches and neck pain.  Leaves me clear enough to function in day-to-day life, yet very relaxed.”"
