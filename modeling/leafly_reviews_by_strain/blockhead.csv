Blockhead
=============
Xenos,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blockhead/reviews/1322328,"“Blockhead is a cross between an unknown strain and Sweet Tooth.  I get a really nice, calming head effect with this strain and little in the way of body effects until the comedown, which leaves you a little tired.  I find this to be great for night time use.  It really helps with de-stressing after a hard day and inability to sleep at night.  
I would not recommend this strain for any tasks which require full use of...”"

I hit some of this from a bong along with some crazy dank lemon skunk and then vaped some of this blockhead (all with a friend) and holy cow i was flying high as a kite. The smell was almost like a cheese mixed with trainwreck type of smell. It wasn't overly stinky and didn't look out of this world either, but after i smoked it, i was impressed. Elbow and knee pai...”"

c_lion,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blockhead/reviews/1071418,"“Giggly is right. We spent probably a good hour laughing basically devoid of consistent conversation. It delivers tingles throughout your temples in waves to your fingertips and toes. A bong ripper for sure but be ready for it :)”"

chillywilly76,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blockhead/reviews/1220144,"“The warnings about this strain are right on. It's excellent if you want an old-school stone, without thinking of doing too much. I had three pretty small hits off my vape box and a few minutes later I was in the car on my way out (I wasn't driving) and almost wondered if I was in over my head. I survived and had a great time. No paranoia or anxiety, just a nice intense head stone with some good pain-relieving effects...”"

My roommate and I smoked a few joints of Blockhead and spent the next few hours watching our cats play before I laid down for some of the best sleep I’ve had in weeks. Made my lower back pain and knee spur a bit less noticeable but I was hoping for more with its CBD content.”"

It was a bit dry, so I re hydrated it with a boveda pack and let out sit for a few days. A nice citrus tone came out with a nice sweet chronic smell at the end. The flavor profile was limonene, myrcene and a hint of caryophyllene. Meaning it had the citrus flavor with some spicy berry on the exhale. It did not have the deep stone I was ho...”"

What you get from blockhead is a very deep high that relaxes you and lets you think calmly. I highly recommend this strain of you have any small pains, it really helped me forget and numb mine. I would do this at a small late party or a late night sesh. The only reason I don't give a 5 star is that the high ...”"
