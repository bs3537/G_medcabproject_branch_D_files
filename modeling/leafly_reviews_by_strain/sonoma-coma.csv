yondeezy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sonoma-coma/reviews/1168772,"“I got this on my 1st trip to CannaCulture and had to try it since I've never seen it in SF and it won awards. The flower itself is very dense and looks good. Green with lots of light crystals and orange hairs. The smell is subtlety sour. Not as sour as others like Lamb's Bread, but still very good to the nose to the point you can't wait to try it out like McD's fries.

When I smoked it, it was a very good Sativa he...”"

Brian6Xo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sonoma-coma/reviews/1280381,"“instant taste very potent I'm glad I found this gem, it seems like more of a indica very heavy head high”"
nickelodeon,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sonoma-coma/reviews/1163992,"“Very strong sativa dominant hybrid. Very heavy sativa feeling. Lots of laughter, euphoria. Yet indica heaviness delayed sensation. Not super functional but a strain for when you can let go and fuck around. Super dank, won LA cannabis cup. Only need a few puffs and your done on this one.”"
Mathewthebudman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sonoma-coma/reviews/1253064,"“Great tasting Fruity Bud! Glad I got to experience this rare Sativa, but after smoking it, I really think it would lean towards more of a indica maybe I had 
a different phenotype. But it's definitely on my top list! Made me sleepy more then anything 😜”"

Now this coming off the bottom shelf for $8/gram, i wasnt expecting very much. The nugs were nice and fat and they had nice color. i packed myself a bowl and hit it for the first time, and it far exceeded my expectations!! Fe...”"

jadehaze43,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sonoma-coma/reviews/1254176,"“Very relaxing and lowers stress levels almost immediately. Prepare yourself by staying at home when smoking in a bong as you will be max chilled out. Munchies are not too bad either.”"
thchunter,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sonoma-coma/reviews/1343956,"“One of the best sativas I've ever had. The bud has a very pungent, citrusy odor and is very dense with lots of crystals. Has a very nice kick and taste to it, notes of citrus and evergreen come to mind.”"
alamode00,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sonoma-coma/reviews/1178188,"“The listing is incorrect, Sonoma Coma is a heavy INDICA bred in Sonoma California that leaves you scattered across your couch in a tingling, near-comatose state, not a light and energetic sativa.”"

Candyleaves,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sonoma-coma/reviews/1309813,"“I picked up some amazing 79% Sonoma coma dab today. I agree with a few of the others, this strain made me alert, yet relaxed? oxymoron? ....well....Yes...This strain literally does both jobs. you get the best of both worlds, uplifting head high as expected from a pure sativa, yet, no pain in my hands or back and no anxiety or paranoia. The high cbd content of 2% ( at least it was in the dab I bought ) I think is what...”"

VanIslandCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sonoma-coma/reviews/1309176,"“The very tight and compact looking buds of Sonoma Coma resemble an indica and kind of reminds me of Master Kush (in apearance only). Flower grinds up almost yellow/bright green and the smell is pine. I enjoyed the uplifting effects as much as the come down, it's a great hybrid.”"

Hookakat1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sonoma-coma/reviews/1667655,"“Very nice effects for a Sativa dominant strain. It doesn't drain your energy but it also gives a complex head high.  A very nice combo high.”"
