Strong. Earthy. One previous review it's a good wake up strain, gets the head clear. So good.”"

It hit me quickly out of nowhere and I got stuck for a good minute. 11/10 recommend but honestly don't try to smoke a blunt of it by yourself unless you have the time and munchies to disappear from the world for a good while XD”"

Smooth like butter , it's purple hues are noteable in a very floral wine way when blazed the taste has an edge slight harsh upon smooth classic OG flavor. Just a very unique strain I can say I like this better than some other OG strains . 👽🤘🏻”"
