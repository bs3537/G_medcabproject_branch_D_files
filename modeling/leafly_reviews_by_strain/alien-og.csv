Alien OG
=============
YourDaddy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-og/reviews/1413856,"“I love this stuff! I typically only rate strains that offer a unique experience - uplifting but mellow, etc. This is just a good old-fashioned, knock your dick in the dirt, THC high! What makes this one unique is its potency - just a few solid puffs and you'll be ready to veg out to The Simpsons while eating cereal straight from the box. This flower is to be cared for, from infancy to ingestion. This is the kind of f...”"

I've been smoking regularly for a few years now, and never has a strain given me the same level of stoned in just the first rip as Alien OG. This strain is perfect if you just want to chill around, or if you have errands to run. The high always gives me a similar feeling of reality as skyrim if that makes sense. Like you feel in a different world, a video game world. It makes ot...”"

The body high is melty but I would not recommend this if you need to pay attention to anything. This one is quite powerful, intense and all encompassing. The perfect weed for situations...”"

ajuk2k,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-og/reviews/1380751,"“This stuff smells really good but is very indica dominated. So if indicas are your weapon of choice, this strain is for you. This stuff is strictly for relaxing and just chilling . You will be couch locked with this strain for sure. I straight up melted into a massage chair. This stuff is also great for insomnia and pain relief. Definitely makes for some sleepy boat times!”"

hgds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alien-og/reviews/1380825,"“phenomenal smoke and very smooth. Aromas of fruit and cloves are present in the thick smoke, and the effects kick in quickly. Makes one feel a little spacy and makes one slightly hallucinate. Although you will be spaced out you will still be able to move normally and focus fine. Good for before sleeping. Much euphoria and pain relief is noted. overall a very strong and pleasant smoke.”"

You can feel mental faculties going blank, staring absently, unsure what you were doing again. There’s an edge that’s a little too real. It’s loos...”"
