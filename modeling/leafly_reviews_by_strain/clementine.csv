This is the ticket--a super uplifting high feeling, lots of head with some body features. A nice, buzzy sativa feel that is mellowing into a chill, but focused and happy, high. Vaped in my GPro; picked up at Caliva. New favorite Sativa for real.”"
AZSnoopy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/clementine/reviews/1319984,"“Still new to various strains and flowers but this is definitely the best Sativa strain I've tried so far. Got it as a preroll at Nature's AZ and happy I did. Long lasting mellow happy high. Definitely will try again.”"

I read the reviews, chatted to the staff at my favourite dispensary (Talent Health Club) and took a gram of this home.

First thing this morning, I took three hits frmo my DynaVap M. and as other say, the cerebral rush was more or less immediate. I waited an huor, totally "in my head", having some very...”"

The smell and taste are the best i have ever had, the taste is so pure citrus and last for so long. The high is happy, relaxed with energy to get things done. This is a great cross of 2 great strains, if you like citrus buds this is a must.”"

Once you have *ideally grown and nurtured* Tangie, you have high hopes! With that said, I really enjoyed the buzz. In the yard taking deadheads off flowers after smoking this, was like morning meditation! The flavor grew on me, since I had half an oz to smoke...it does get better.

Picked this up in Olympia, WA. You guys, the smell! Straight citrus punch right to the nose! Totally dig it. The hit has delivered a little bit of spice (hitting off a bong).

Anyhoo, I felt maybe 10 percent more energetic for about 20 min. I really barely noticed a difference, no real high or euphoria or anything else.
