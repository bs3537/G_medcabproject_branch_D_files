Had a limited quantity this time around, but just enough to get a decent feel for it. Super uplifting, but not purely a daytime smoke! I was able to pass out quickly after getting blasted off of this stuff with my girl. The smell and taste are simply overwhelming. Super euphoric, super fantastic. Expect a better review in the next two-three days.”"

hemlocklily,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/organic-diesel/reviews/1365226,"“I was somewhat sceptical about this strain because the taste and smell leave something to be desired (in my opinion). But once I experienced the effects, I was impressed. Great for daytime use, keeps me uplifted and clear-headed. A little harsh if we're being honest, but the effects are worth it.”"
