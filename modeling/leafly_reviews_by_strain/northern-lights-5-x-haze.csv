ConeheadJ,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1410901,"“I'm shocked this is listed as a "new" strain. I had one of the best grows ever using NL5 x Haze back in 1993 with seed brought back from Holland, where iirc it won the cup about the same time period. It put everything else at that time to shame - both over there, and once back home. Very, very instantaneous mental effect and relief of any nausea, followed by total couchlock if overindulged.... as in please, for the l...”"

gangagal,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1385155,"“Literally the greatest marijuana I have ever smoked. The anxiety relief and calmness of the NTL was clear and the haze cerebral experience resulted in blissful synergy. 

I didn't think that it could get better than straight haze but I was wrong and so glad that I tried this strain. If you see it on the menu don't pass it up. This is incredible bud. 

I never thought I'd be able to name a favorite strain until I trie...”"
Trilly1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1388610,"“Absolutely amazing. I honestly have never expercined such an amazing high. You can use it as daytime and nightime. It won't keep you up like an strong Sativa, but it won't couchlock you either.

The taste & smell is very good as well.”"

Jeekayjay,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1385121,"“Beautiful dark green buds laced with orange hair and caked with crystals.  Smells of sweet earthy pine.

Doesn't bust out very large but the vapor is smooth and fairly thick.

Feeling pretty baked after .2 however not much motivation at all.

Later...

Well I slept.  Northern Lights is definitely coming through in a big way on this strain.

If it was just some random weed I was smoking to get high I'd be fine but thi...”"
NORCO4LIFE,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1645273,"“One of my favourite Sativa strains at this time.. I picked this up solely for daytime use to treat anxiety. Before anyone says anything about using Sativa for Anxiety, if you use a moderate to low dose, it’s perfect such a use. The batch I currently have is crystal coated, hand trimmed, and beautifully dried and cured. The smell is very pungent with heavy notes of citrus and spice. The flavour is sweet and almost fru...”"
cccofme,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1357462,"“This is my review for the 2nd phenotype that I grew. The bud is more appealing than the 1st pheno that I reviewed but the medicine wasn't as powerful, it was more leaning in the indica side, which I personally prefer. As a sativa dominant strain, the first was better and closer to what the strain should be. Don't be fooled, this strain is powerful and long-lasting as all the strains I grow are, if they aren't powerfu...”"
JoshLoc,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1309336,"“Really good stuff if you need to get things done. Find it to be a lot like hempstar except the NL shines through a bit more in this.”"
kmarko19,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1531936,"“One of my favourite daytime strains. Great flavour, effects are present but not overwhelming. Creative and outgoing results”"
cccofme,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1357460,"“I grew two phenotypes of this strain, and tried the 1st pheno last night and got completely STONED. The one that I tried grew small loose airy buds with very dark orange hairs and a faint citrus smell. Not much taste, and after 3 to 4 hits and no feeling at all, was wondering how good it was, but then BAM it started in the face and alternated body head, but mostly head and very very STONED. EXCELLENT.. The 2nd pheno ...”"

Chancestopher005,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1357458,"“Very great and close to original bud. Reminds me a little of sweet tooth of Jack Here. Great floral notes of pine and pungent citrus.”"
ForBodyAndMind,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1309808,"“Northern Lights 5 x Haze immediately provides its cerebral, stimulating, effect with a feeling of energy.

It does not have a unique flavor. It does not have a notable or pleasant aroma.

Very strong, truly the feeling of a sativa bud that you're probably looking for.”"
Chancestopher005,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1357459,"“It has beautiful white tricomes. It smells of good old skool skunk bud with elements of pungent citrus. I would like to read and see more pictures and reviews. Smokes like a charm.”"
gnarly_pinkbean,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1385156,"“Sativas are not my favorite.  I suffer from high anxiety, so this strain had me a little paranoid. I smoked a bowl in my bong before going into work and at first I was very talkative and productive.  After a few hours went by I started to feel how I feel with any Sativa.  A little paranoid, anxious, slight headache, and very hungry.  Overall pretty nice high.  It would have been better if I brought more to smoke on m...”"
Dana1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1453594,"“got some from Broken Coast in Canada L.P. very invigorating strain with a nice taste hard to impress but the oldies are still goodies”"
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1357029,"“This strain is known as a precursor to the heavy hitter Strawberry Cough, known as "The Cough"! Bud Structure: Nicely trimmed bushy Christmas tree nugs, some shaped into torpedos. Caylaxes all over this bud, like happy trichs dipped in a vat of kief. Purple spots here and there, though deep redwood oak hair's covering this nugget from head to toe. Pushing on it leaves my fingers caked in kief. The Smell: Funky skunky...”"

TraumaReleaf,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1394727,"“Amazingly unique smooth taste and very clear headed uplifting effects, found it functional for the day. 
No drowsy feelings or sleepiness with this one, being that it's actually a bit energetic. 
While energetic it did not induce any sort of racy feelings that can sometimes produce anxiety.
One of the best sativa dominant strains for producing true sativa effects.”"
AmstelTopClassWeed,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1486128,"“Amsterdam is so hooked on Northern #5 easy to control the Growth and result are exactly what you expect 
N#5 is top Class.”"
KDH75,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1291316,"“Had this for the very first time today...

Gravlabs/ice water/ash chamber. Small to medium bowl. I use wind proof torches for precision and high heat.

This method gave me 3 big, smooth, flavorful hits that turned my slide hazy yellow/green after.

Great for day time focus and mood elevation. Distinct flavor but not unpleasant.

Works on pain. Had a cross-bowl w/Amnesia CBD for an intense psychoactive high. 

Brings ...”"
JoeyBud74,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1663225,"“I tried this amazing strain last April in Amsterdam. It was my last day there with my wife and it was 10 PM. Our feet were destroyed. I found that Boerejoengens Coffe Shop and explained them that my wife and i would love to stay up another 3 or 4 hours before headin' to the hotel. Well, they gave me that strain and it was perfect. I think the best weed i ever smoked...I smoke from 1988 btw :)
Worth a try”"
ZionLast,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1617565,"“As soon as I heard NL plus Haze I knew I was going to experience something special. Northern Lights is to me a straight KO indica. Mellow mood and strong bodyhigh.  Love it for pain etc.. Most Hazestrains have a bit of a racey side and can be challenging on the more anxiety ridden patient with its intense sativa-trait.

This strain is a godsend, especially for those dealing with anxietyproblems. It has that Indica fe...”"
Jcc00pley,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1303157,"“A very smooth taste and burn smoke.  The exhale has dry aroma smell. Pine and pitch. Easy  and fast to grow, high yielding with average size buds.  Cut as it ripens as grass should be.”"

djdaveathome,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1337769,"“It was back in the 90's. Closet grow. Seeds were ordered from a Vancouver shop. Plants were taller than expected. Colas were huge! Little 'whirlwind' buds continually popping out prompting me to consider that it may never stop producing. Finally took it down. 
Beautiful smoke. Quite an uplifting high. Flavour was similar to NL#5 from what I remember. Great for computer work. Focused yet oblivious to all else.”"
dionysus382,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1630384,"“In all honesty, a well grown and cared for gem like this, can be an ethereal event. After perusing the online dispensary, which is my daily job, Out of nowhere appeared this amazing and undeniably alluring listing for N5h. I acquired a fat eighth in Palm Springs, and immediately knew I was in for an nearly psychedelic brainwash. My suspicions were not unfounded.  My experiences began in the late 70's so I have had th...”"
GunnyOG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1687136,"“I recently picked up some of this strain at a medical dispensary. It brought me back to the 1990s when both NL5 and landraces were popular. Glad to have found this herb because I remember being happy and the high was always long lasting. The NL5 definitely felt more dominant. Good strain for visiting the zoo or museum. As for my condition, it helps keep my headaches at bay.”"
ChrisMacDowell,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1357461,"“Nugs are dark green, with purple leaves and reddish-orange hairs. The nugs have a pungent, earthy-citrus taste, with faint spiciness.. Easy to break up. Smoke is smooth, with a strong tobacco taste. The buzz is immediate and relaxing. Great for anxiety/depression.”"
Waldoo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/northern-lights-5-x-haze/reviews/1411634,"“NL5 X Haze gave me a very long lasting high, with a pretty strong couch-lock. I recommend to smoke this strain in the night.”"
