Sot of made a mistake by smoking a joint of it at a concert, got me tired and heavy fast. But it definitely seemed to have some sativa properties as well. Overall a great night time strain!”"

It looks amazing and smells like a earthier than citrusy O.G. If you want the euphoria, I would look to another O.G. Red Eye will chill you out and that's about it. Cannabiotix does work, but this is just not my favorite O.G! a-Humulene: 1.238 mg/g, a-Pinene: 1.274 mg/g, Caryophyllene: 1.158 mg/g...”"

Back in Cali I would call this Fine Cannabis A++ Amazing From the moment I opened the jar to the moment it knocked me out. Sticky, potent, dank smelling nuggets! For me it was great for stress, anxiety, and relaxing before bed. Thank you Cannabiotix  for the best meds around!”"
