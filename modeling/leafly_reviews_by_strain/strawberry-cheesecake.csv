Strawberry

ogtank,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1394331,"“The patients I grow for absolutely love this strain. 

It's a great medical strain for pain and has helped about 50 different patients get a better night's sleep (while numbing pain).

Heavyweight Seeds even donated some of these to our cause and has been helping us with anything we've needed (advice-wise) since day one.

Great breeder and great genetics all-in-one.”"

While I was packing I cracked open a nug and a beautiful dank smell came out. This bud smells like a tasty desert. The taste is kind of a darker berry if that makes sense. It leaves a very tasty taste after you smoke it so after you smoke dont drink or eat anything and just enjoy the tasty after taste. The high is great right off the bat. I feel uplifted and it seems l...”"

golden_dragonfly,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1372538,"“This is a great strain that comes on smooth & quick. The buzz is euphoric, light & high. I felt no stress, and my back pain didn't bother me. I didn't get mad munchies, and felt motivated enough to focus on getting things done around the house. This bud let me down very easy - all in all a good choice for daytime use.”"
Candyleaves,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1309728,"“This strain honestly surprised me. as someone who uses a sativa dominant hybrid during the day and a pure indica at night, I usually shy away from an indica during the day as the couch lock doesn't allow for much to get done. Lol... however, this strain, is much different. I actually do not feel tired on strawberry cheesecake, it actually just relaxes you into a happy mood. 
I would highly recommend this strain  for ...”"

Dwarren,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1336069,"“I loved the high experienced after consuming strawberry cheesecake. It is very relaxing and perfect for a chill night. Strong mental clarity and decreased anxiety are also pleasantly accepted with this strain.”"
tchapman04,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1371189,"“A very potent strain which takes effect fast. Definitely improves my mood, can't take the goofy grin off my face and it worked wonders for my back pain.”"
TheBigGreenGiant,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1336072,"“Only had a few drags of this strain but from what I have had I can state that it has a fruity smell and the taste is a perfect balance of cheese and strawberry flavouring.”"
hanse103,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1284906,"“This 100% indica is amazing...my hip pain was flaring up and after I smoked some of this flower I was relaxed, happy, and calm...it felt like I had just gotten a full body massage. I'm normally more of a sativa girl because I have an active lifestyle day to day, but this indica (in my opinion) and a lot of sativa properties I like while also easing my hip pain away, enabling me to continue being active without the da...”"

BurningMary,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1354437,"“A lovely strain that has to this day yet to be matched for pain relief. At least for my sort of neuropathic burning skin pain. Dry mouth is annoying though, but it comes with sweet sweet blissful release from the horrid pain of a damaged spinal cord, so it's totally worth it! I love this lady for holding me tight and whisking away my pain and leaving me relaxed and happy!”"

F4iguy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1431999,"“Strawberry cheesecake is a great option for people who suffer from anxiety. In my opinion it's similar to taking a benzodiazepine. If you over do it you will be sleepy after the high fades.  This strain is a bomb mix of white widow x cheese x chronic which just happen to be my favourite strains! Oh and it tastes and smells like strawberry moonrocks!”"
TwistedRose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1310527,"“She does smell and taste fruity and sweet.

CoCoBudz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1553803,"“One of my favorite indica-dominant hybrids. From the taste, the smell and the colors of the bud, I enjoyed this strain throughout. I struggle with anxiety, and this hybrid was great for relaxing in the evenings. Also, I didn't get food cravings with this strain, which is something my fat ass struggles with, so that's another plus for me!”"
BigDikBilly,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1766173,"“Smoked this strain pure with no tobacco and lordy lord did it hit me like a train, Smoked about 3.5grams and it was a very nice tasting smoke, but it was the adventure I had after which was crazy. When I listend to music i could see the music video happening in front of my eyes.

This also really helped me get a good nights sleep”"
eliwilzon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1747538,"“If I could give this strain six stars I would. I would like to start off by saying this strain is amazing. It doesn’t even feel like an indica. This strain gives you a clear head and relaxed mind set. You don’t feel pins and needles and virtually nothing bothers you if you don’t let it.

afropunk90,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1500188,"“A sedating, light, and clear headed indica. Great for those who seek feelings of euphoria, relaxation and pain relief, without the extreme grogginess that other heavy indicas come with. Great for doing things like studying, reading or writing code (if you're a programmer), but if you're looking for something to knock you on your ass this isn't the strain.”"
Ganglebot,https://www.leafly.com/indica/strawberry-cheesecake/reviews/1287129,"“The way hybrids should be - providing only the best of each strain.

SC give you the energy and creativity but without leaving you wired and silly. I heard music in my mind.
