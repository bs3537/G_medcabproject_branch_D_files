errzy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-ape/reviews/1417173,"“What a brilliant strain. With my experience,  the fun starts around 30 seconds into my initial intake.

Then I would sink. But loved getting up and walking around, no dizziness, everything was just kind of fun.

Finally I go back to the couch and have, what I considered at the time, "deep thoughts". 

"I should go get my journal and write all of this down" I  thought. 

Then the logic side of my brain just says "dude...”"

I never imagined knowing what that felt like but for some reason I just felt really big. My hand didn't look bigger but it certainly felt huge. I'm a seasoned smoker (vaporizer) and have never felt anything quite like it. Obviously gives you some couch lock which is great for streaming Netflix and going to sleep.”"

It was grown, flushed, dried and trimmed properly by a local dispensary here in Michigan. The smell was so beautifully filled with berry and grape tones.  The smoke out of my bubbler was so incredibly smooth and tasty that I didn't want to stop.  Ga is a creeper for me as the effects take about 5-10 minutes.   Then, incredible head relaxation...”"

The only anxiety relief and the only time I could eat more than half a cracker was when I smoked the grape ape. After three hits I could feel a wave wash over me. When you are in a dark anxiety/ depression induced place and get any form of instant relief, it's a god send. Better than Xanax. Perfect anxiety drug.”"

Was able to salvage a few clones of Grape Ape.  This strain fends of bugs and disease better than any strain I've grown.  Forget to water it?  Grape Ape bounces back.  Very tenacious.

I can relax and enjoy things (especially parties or nights out where normally my social anxiety and awkwardness is at its worst) without being noticeably high. I also like this strain for insomnia. Just makes you feel mellow and relaxed.”"
