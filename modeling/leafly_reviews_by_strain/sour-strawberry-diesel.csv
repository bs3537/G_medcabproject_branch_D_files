levitaylor78,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1329823,"“the taste of strawberry with that added sour diesel that tastes amazing and leaves an after taste in your mouth for ages. clear head high which gave me great laughter watching comedy and great relaxation for my anger levels. could easily drift off and think up crap for an hour. not great for muscle soreness or pain though.”"
strychninecandy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1391978,"“recently obtained this strain and it is delightful.  the buds are compact, glistening with trichomes and smell like an herbaceous strawberry jam.  diesel aspects are clearly noticeable but the concentrated fruitiness is dominant.

the taste, as currently being baked from a vapir prima, is smooth and reminiscent of japanese ichigo - strawberry cream.  delicious.

the high is both uplifting and relaxing.  i have experi...”"

This strain boosted my mood and increased my sex drive. It made me more sensitive to touch and somewhat decreased my anxiety. The increased libido is important to me because my sex drive is artificially low because I’m taking anti depressants for anxiety. So far this is my favorite strain and I highly recommend it if you can get your hands on it!”"
missumami,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1389160,"“Tingly for sure. relaxed. a little bit more of a head effect, with time seeming a little less linear. This does make me randier after smoking it.”"
MrEnigma88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1324696,"“Great taste and smell. Amends almost identical to strawberries but you definitely smell the diesel lineage. High THC strain with like .2% cbd”"
faerieJheartsA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1309709,"“This strain is dope! Exactly! Gorgeous, glowing buds ... Pipes me up ... Uplifting, strong, even understanding ... Opens one up ... Star gazing, sun lazing, a bit of both! Ha. Seriously; crisp crunchy delicately flowered plants, great to bust up, roll, effects take effect immediately and it's uphill from there ... Smells nice ... High is like laser electric energy of the soul, or something more cool even perhaps ...”"
empireit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1372291,"“It's a surprisingly relaxing sativa. Nothing is overwhelming. It's the first strain I've ever felt "with it" after a couple hours with the heightened sense sativa normally gives me. Definitely didn't notice any pain. Would recommend.”"
TheoKeen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1372289,"“Great all around high, the tingliness that comes with it is perfect for listening to music and relaxing.”"

The combination of the two flavors mellows the smoke in to a smooth and extremely relaxing high, that is perfect for a hard day after work. The nugs I got are smaller, but make it up by being dense, and are also dark green with minamal Brown ...”"

Shadowforcenick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1365319,"“I have some nug run BHO by Hush Extracts. Light in color, with a distinctive sweet odor. One thing hit me, and that was the smell and flavor of vasoline. The smell was odd, but the flavor complemented the sweetness well. I didn't get a diesel phenotype apparently, so no distinctive gas taste was noticed”"

levitaylor78,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1328707,"“love this strain so much.  tastes sweet and has that strawberry taste with the smell of diesel coming through after. the after taste is bueatiful and lingers in your mouth for some time. the high is instant relaxation, I feel a little euphoric but my anger levels have subsided considerably. head high is quite clear but could easily drift off and think up crap for an hour.”"
SafetyLast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1274616,"“Bought it as an 80/20sativa/indica, which seems Fair. Clear taste of both the sour D and strawberry. The second spliff tasted like the strawberry shishas we used to do in our early teens. Very, very relaxing strain, lightly funny, and goes off with getting you sleepy.”"

breannecheri,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1451841,"“I was super excited to try this strain I smoked it once before at night and it was a great mellow high but I smoked it this morning and wow. it was a very deep almost spiritual high. I thought very deeply about everything and became very in tune with some deep seeded feelings.”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-strawberry-diesel/reviews/1431365,"“Hits me intensely like a strong sativa at first but fades soon after the head rush to a super relaxing buzz that stick around for a while without completely sedating me. Great option if you are looking for the diesel genetics in a less sativa more balanced hybrid. 4.5/5.”"

Strawberry Sour Diesel is a 50/50 hybrid the thc levels are between 26% and 28% and CBD 4%.  It has a sweet fruity gas scent, the taste, however, is almost like a strawberry milkshake only with a hint of a fuel taste.
