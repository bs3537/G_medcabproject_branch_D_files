LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/vader-og/reviews/1411975,"“Have had this DAMN STRONG Indica in flower and concentrate and I love it way too much, this is like a knock you out sleeper, imagine Darth Vader from "Rouge One" that fearsome badass, well that's exactly how this bud is! It's a must try and needs to be used for people who have horrible pain or sleep issues, it also works on alot of other things. If and when you get this in concentrate....START SMALL! Build up my frie...”"
kingan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/vader-og/reviews/1327911,"“Heavy, long-lasting, and euphoric effects. I got this strain in a concentrate and it's better than some of the Indica concentrate strains I've had but I wouldn't say it's the best.”"
Dodododo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/vader-og/reviews/1368229,"“I have fybo, which results in some very sleepless night. Vader helped me get t least a few decent hours of sleep. For me, it was a very strong onset and lasted a good hour or two after a couple bong hits. The only real issue I had was that when I got up the next morning, I felt really hazy, something I don't usually experience. I have tested this on a few other strains and Vader is the only one that does this to me. ...”"

If you see it buy it. Most flavor in a strain since the 94 northern lights when I grew up. Period.🤘✌️🙏🌱🌧☀”"

Vader OG is a unique pheno of OG Kush lineage in that it smells strongly of spice, hash, pepper, wood, pine, and skunk. It tastes almost lemony on the exhale. Superb classic OG bud structure and taste with hints of pepper and spice. The cut of Vader OG I obtained was from the renowned 'Queen of Hearts' grow op from LA. It is about as good as an OG can get when grown properly like queen of hearts ma...”"

Muggs325,https://www.leafly.com/indica/vader-og/reviews/1477346,"“Great strain for just kicking back and relaxing. This kush made me feel really cozy and want to watch TV and eat. Definitely a strong strain for memory loss in my opinion. I always forget shit and get confused. But I really like this strain.”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/vader-og/reviews/1373951,"“Intense flowery piney scent and nugs completely frosted with trichomes. Didn't get numbers but had to be THC in the mid to high 20s. Basically makes my eyes close the second I smoke it. Does a give a burst of euphoria at first but I use it mostly as a sleep aid since it's such a day ender for me.”"

1kushking,https://www.leafly.com/indica/vader-og/reviews/1576525,"“The buds I had, had a few hairs and crystals but, they were pretty dense. The taste and smell again didn't really stand out to me. A mild sweet smell & a mild spicy taste is the best I could describe it. Then come the effects and they are awesome. My mind would bounce around playfully as the nice body relaxation creeps in eventually putting me to sleep. A great night time strain. FOUR AND A HALF STARS!!”"
Jbaby007,https://www.leafly.com/indica/vader-og/reviews/1639781,"“I only smoke Indicas. Vader is a bit of a creeper, definitely going straight to a body high with a tiny bit of cerebral high around 10-15 minutes.. It's very relaxing and melted my stress right away. I can't comment on its effects on pain yet but overall it's very chill. I bought this at Natty Rems downtown Denver.”"

errzy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/vader-og/reviews/1650241,"“Beautiful smooth light and uplifting feelings, without the sedating type effects, brought on by most Indicas. 

I am diagnosed with epilepsy, and I found this strain to help me smooth out the jolts brought on by a seizure as most Indica do, but without falling feeling super groggy. 

In most cases (aside from high CBD strains) I cannot ingest MMJ during the day since I have a very low tolerance and I tend to fall rig...”"
