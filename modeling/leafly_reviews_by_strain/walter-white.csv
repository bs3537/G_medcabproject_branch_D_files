Walter White is an EXCEPTIONAL hybrid with a truly unique balance of flavors and a potent buzz to go with it. The aroma is that of a classic OG with an extra sharp piney smell and a sweet earthy undertone. Subtle citrus tones shine through as well. Beautifully frosted over with trichomes, this OG is definitely will please even the heaviest of tokers. This has quicky become one of my to...”"
gudgud4twenty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1384290,"“Extremely fire strain. Had nice cerebral effect with a relaxing body sensation. It felt nice because I was upbeat and energetic, but relaxed and caked. I recommend this strain highly for any one needing potent medication.”"
CdnDrkLtr1960,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1359187,"“Totally loving this strain from Mephisto Genetics. A solid cerebral shot, as well as an awesome body experience. With a fairly high THC, a true hybrid in every way! Lovin' me some Walter White! 🔥💨🔥💨🔥💨”"
nuckscelts,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1349633,"“Just grabbed some of this from the local dispensary! Huge thick dense nugs with lots of dark orange hairs. Has a nice citrusy taste, a little earthy as well. Half way through the half gram joint my whole body just started to feel tingly. My thoughts were immediately happy and at total calm. Shortly after it hits the brain and you're left with the perfect high. It's kind of like that feeling the first time smoking a j...”"

MagzDuBry,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1383634,"“I love it! It made me feel creative and giggly. Definitely helped the depression and stress. I did, however, go on the biggest munchie binge which I do not mind considering I need help gaining weight. I would buy this every time a place has it because I can function great during the day with it 😊”"

mattyg107,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1567140,"“Wow no wonder it's called what it is, this gram filled up my grinder with a nice amount to throw right back in the joint.. Now I feel like running a marathon, and when the burnout comes you'll feel like you have. It's more in line with green crack this strain. Up then down, but it's not like you'll be put to sleep. I've tried it at work and still very functional. Highly recommended, just a little harsh in the morning...”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1464172,"“The taste is a mind trip... name sake two thumbs up. 

The aroma is all Walter White. The taste is like Heisenberg.

Dense feathery beige nugs with moderate amount of clear and amber trich hold a good amount of small thin red hairs. Leaves are green. Good contrasting colors broken up. Smell is very complex and stinky. Lemon, orange, cedar, pepper, flowers, and hops. The aroma is very well balanced with a variety of t...”"
PJL83,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1319765,"“Fantastic strain. Sativa-leaning with a very cerebral, focused high, but has some indica kick too. Looks absolutely gorgeous, tastes and smokes even better. Grab some of this when you can.”"

MelodyMoon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1611091,"“I enjoyed the super chill, well balanced nature of this strain. Everything I engaged in was done so super mellow, externally, with an on-going internal monologue and heightened awareness. 👏🏽”"

vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1319764,"“Decent arthritis pain relief. Perfect for soaking in a hot tub. And as an added bonus, music visualization 1/2 hour into it. Not much taste or smell, a bit earthy, but smooth vapour even at higher temperatures.”"

IamRed667,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1352280,"“Just got some Walter White OG from Blum on Decatur.  All I did was open the bag, break it up, rolled a j and put it in a smell free tube.  The entire upstairs of my house smelled from just that.  Couldn't wait to puff on it and when I did, the taste was amazing and one who has a high tolerance, I was buzzed out of my brain.  Enjoy it!”"
cannabliss04,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1327393,"“This is definitely a new favorite of mine! The smell is amazing. Smooth for inhale and overall gives you a great high in an instant! It definitely made me giggly and in the zone, creatively and for the high. The after effects with total relaxtion is a bonus for me. I definitely recommend this strain!”"
CannaMD,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1343431,"“I've had this a few times. From different dispensaries. Each batch I've had has been great. This is a consistent strain. I find that often rare. So I appreciate that about this one. It's light, tasty and great for  anxiety.”"

AKboy84,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1620462,"“Growing a batch of this.. very very white and fast staring cause of the auto afghani kush, but all mine smell like grape spree candy.. very sticky and not tall like a sativa but short and stacked. 16 days into flower and already stinky. How do I upload pics? My plants look way bether then the couple pics already up”"
Juliie420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1724789,"“nice but harsh tasting woody bud, almost tangy...left me happy, calm, a bit talkative. Would be good for anxiety or depression. Pretty good local dispensary strain”"
Dankyy_Davee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1690860,"“Decent sativa off the bat. Flavor profile doesn't WOW you..but there is some Earthy undertones. High is a very good mental buzz. Something on the "uplifted" side of things. GREAT for activities on a weekend.”"
JonnyDenver,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1692324,"“Great hybrid strain! Felt a pretty intense head high as my body relaxed and melted into the chair. Not as heavy as my fav indica - G13 and not as buzzy as Green Crack. It’s a nice in-between but strong high. Definite citrus taste and aroma. Smooth smoke that doesn’t give that feeling like your chest is on fire. Walter White will be in my hybrid rotation for sure”"

StateofMorgan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/walter-white/reviews/1485767,"“This stuff is very mellow. I don't know that I'd smoke it first thing in the morning, but it's got enough go that it would be a good afternoon weed. Not a kickstarter--personally I wouldn't do it before any job I HAD to get done, but I would totally take a hit or two while I was in the middle of a task and feel confident it would energize rather than derail me. Mildly spacey, relaxing, and clear-headed enough to let ...”"
