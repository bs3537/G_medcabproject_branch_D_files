KT16,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1417378,"“I suffer from overall pain, severe anxiety, and insomnia. I've tried many strains and experienced many disappointments! This Enigma left me feeling so incredibly good! It started as an energetic happy that slowly wound down to a ready for bed sensation that gave me one of the best nights sleep I've had in months! No cotton mouth, almost zero head high, and an overall sense of happiness are the reasons this is now my ...”"

It seems that the Enigma i got my hands on is a bit different than everyone else's, which is a bit of a conundrum. 
After a relatively small bowl, my head is filled with dancing Fantasia mushrooms and all I want to do is jam out on Rock Band. 
There's no bad aftertaste whatsoever, and the air will smell of citrus for hours. Fair warning, you'll be a ...”"

SeaDub14,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1417381,"“Lots of frosty trichomes, tasted earthy and sweet, very enjoyable... great for social situations, conversations if you can stay on track... serious appetite... now a calmed, sedate finish, ready for bed.  Excellent pain relief also; attacked menstrual cramps & stiff neck.”"
JacobbTG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1239085,"“I appreciate The Joint Venture, the suppliers of the fantastic Ortega and the always consistent Night Nurse. So naturally, when I spotted this strain, sporting the cartoon eyeball at the bottom
of a question mark, peering up from the "Enigma" title on the package, The Joint Venture proudly printed on the front, I was quite excited to try it. But whoever named this strain got it right, it's a bit of a head scratcher. ...”"
madrussian76,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1323136,"“Enigma is aptly named in that the high seems different every time I've smoked it and the initial effect more closely resembles a sativa - before settling gently into a wonderful textbook indica lull. I can't say enough good things about Enigma; my only complaints are that only one dispo offers out locally and it's not often available on the recreational side. I'd definitely recommend this strain if you suffer from an...”"
ladams60,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1417014,"“Top rate strain. High is very mellow and relaxed. Euphoric feelings trump any depression, even though it is a laid back strain.  Very fragrant, with a fruity almost gingerlike odor, but very pleasant.  Anxiety and nausea are shown relief with Enigma.”"
highdefnition,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1417380,"“This stuff was ridiculous... only had it once and almost forgot until i saw the old medicine bottle. Super earthy and almost kush like this was a definite stand out, but i haven't seen it since. Strong, tastey and relaxing meds though!”"

idont,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1339377,"“This is the closed to LSD you'll ever get legally. However still wouldn't go back to this strain for the feeling going into it but the experience. Don't go to bed right away and end up on a magic carpet ride. Portland OR, because that was really weird.”"
SoldierVEGA,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1381413,"“Smooth.  Best way to describe it, smooth transition into relaxation with a feeling or happieness followed by epic munchies.  it was a super fun night time watch a movie or video game sesh kind of strain.”"
TokinLady,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1738164,"“There are no words. Try it..you will like it.  Highly recommend!!”"
ShoozyQ,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1193770,"“It was great for my sciatica pain but left me feeling an over awareness of my body which I didn't enjoy.  However ingesting it made me sleep like a baby and lessened greatly the body awareness.  It smelled great ... Like the old days 😉”"

beerdcraft,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1243508,"“This is my favorite strain, hands down. Really chills me out.”"
CBDGrl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1249764,"“I love, love, love this strain! My favorite thus far for sleep, muscle and joint pain, and anxiety. I prefer indicas in general, and this is amazing medication for me.”"
L1NT,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1263127,"“a fav among the indicas, love this one for night time and movie watching...no so great for intense video gaming unless you wanna die....lol but great for sleep as well”"
BoogaShuga,https://www.leafly.com/indica/enigma/reviews/1239337,"“Active high - confused about the species on here, because what I smoked was a 70-30 sativa dominant. Never the less was a good high, talkative and relaxed. Not sleepy until the very end when I CRASHED.”"
