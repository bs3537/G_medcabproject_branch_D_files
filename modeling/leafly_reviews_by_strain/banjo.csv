I smoke this when i dont feel like doing anythinv besides chillin. I would not smoke this for a functional high. It makes my eyes super red. Smells citrusy and fresh.”"
JahFather,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banjo/reviews/1702392,"“Great strain it’s one of my new favorites for so many reasons...First the looks of the flowers are terrific, chunky with nice density and completely coated in sugar and a small size piece will break up into a big splif. The taste and smell are super unique and complex, definitely fruity yet almost a licorice or anise flavor with some piney notes and it has a pungent diesel & fruit smell. The smell again is very uniqu...”"

Beautiful green and yellowish leaves, inter layered like an elvish sword handle; it looked like old school army camouflage..I thought of Arnold on Predator, and that is good. Structure wise, she had some Dense buds covered in peach fuzz crystals, just like daddy likes them. Bitch was pungent, almost oniony, smelly enough to know right off the bat that it was going to be fuckin...”"
MEGTRAN2000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banjo/reviews/1699951,"“This strain smells unbelievably musky and is covered in lovely white crystals which turn iridescent in bright light. It's shape, small dense nuggets resembles popcorn and burns with a generous amount of smoke. It gave me a whole body high which helped immensely with my chronic pain. It also gave a fantastic sense of euphoria while still allowing me to focus on whatever tasks were at hand. It was strong without being ...”"

dmstory,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banjo/reviews/1667386,"“Excellent strain. Aroma and flavors are unique and pungent. Taste is on par with it's attractive odor. Many secondary processors have raved about it's work-ability and high yields. Definitely worth a try.”"
Bomo1201,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banjo/reviews/1790552,"“The stench is more of a cheesy smell but a very relaxing waft. The nugs are pretty fat to be honest with a little bit of purp on it and the thick orange-red hairs makes this one of my favorites just by appearance and smell! As well as this not being a popular strain at least where I am from. But it makes it fun to smoke.
Grinding and loading the weed was just flat out satisfying lol but taste is a earthy and diesel t...”"
laughpad,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banjo/reviews/1744370,"“I have outdoor grown Banjo so that might change something. Anyway it has a heavy and slightly bitter flavor and it comes with a wonderful body high with some paranoia. It keeps you up and active during the high but it can make you pretty drowsy afterwards. Very enjoyable high all around and would definitely recommend trying.”"
smikeybikey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banjo/reviews/1802943,"“With no other way to describe it: This high hit me right off with this wild feeling of energy rolling down my body. A balanced high, mostly in your head, could be great to draw or walk with when you want a relaxed but concentrated afternoon. A bit social but not incredibly. Made me willing to take whatever happens in life.”"
heyuhleee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banjo/reviews/1758878,"“Bought a Banjo pre-roll and just finished it off! I'm really digging this strain. It makes me feel mellow, creative, and most importantly, happy! It did induce a little bit of anxiety, but I may have just consumed too much. Overall a great Sativa dominate hybrid!”"
anastasiacolette,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banjo/reviews/1733025,"“THIS IS STRONG. Definitely accidentally over did it. Heavy smoker for the past 3yrs, made the mistake of taking a massive bong rip of this brand new strain. Sent me into a full blown panic attack. For 5hrs. I couldn’t feel my heart beat I was so high. It’s so relaxing that I think my body was convinced it was dead. Powerful punch. Meanwhile my boyfriend was on cloud nine after taking a more reasonable rip.”"
Nishian,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banjo/reviews/1786304,"“Lowell Herb

Don’t feel too sleep, more of a body high than head high.
Love it so it’s a 4.5. 
Also had it w Matt’s clean bong so I could really taste the flower and it’s honestly not bad.”"

A little cloudy but nothing you can't handle. Definitely great for sex!! I just finished working in the bedroom and I must say this strain brought the animal out of me, definitely recommend this strain.”"
