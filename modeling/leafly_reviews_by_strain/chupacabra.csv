LotusKai,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chupacabra/reviews/1670282,"“This is definitely one of the BEST hybrids I've ever smoked. To me, it features the qualities I look for in both an Indica and a Sativa. It's definitely a creeper, so don't take to many hits to quick otherwise you'll regret it. I took 6-7 hits out of a bong within 5 minutes and was too stoned to do anything for about an hour. The body high was extremely heavy, very couch-locking with an appetite boast. The head high ...”"

If you are looking for a strain that will bring out your social side while at the same time turning on the cruise control, this is it!”"
Boppa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chupacabra/reviews/1352663,"“The first AND second time I smoked this strain, I stayed up through the early morning hours. Not by choice. It seemed to give me so much focus and energy. Reminded me of Green Cush a bit. I enjoyed the pain releaving benefits and the slight euphoria but didn't want to stay up in exchange. After much debate, I gave it another go one night and haven't looked back since. Plenty of sleep since then. This is a smooth smok...”"

Aaron303BlazeUp,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chupacabra/reviews/1667849,"“Definitely a creeper strain. Took me 15-20 minutes before I really started feeling it. Not a strong indica, but it was nice. Decent taste.”"

Medicinecanoe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chupacabra/reviews/1789967,"“I think its creeper weed in the sense that the high changes.  I got a little giggly and mentally energetic for about 30 min to an hr. then bam a slow moving full body and mind relaxation   it wont make you sleep. but sleep under its spell comes super easy and heavy.  only bad for me is I have EDS and I'm still medicated 10 hrs later.  thinking weekend strain.    but lots of things stay in my system extra long.”"

ChillWizard,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chupacabra/reviews/1769405,"“The description here is a bit misleading. Chupacabra is a cross of Golden Goat and Gupta Kush. Golden Goat is in turn a cross of Island Sweet Skunk with a cross of Hawaiian Sativa landrace and Romulan, while Gupta Kush is a cross of Ghost OG and Blue Moonshine. 

I didn't find this strain to be very visually appealing, but crikey was this strong and rather menacing with a high that is a direct flight to la-la land. I...”"

SlanteyedShawn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chupacabra/reviews/1595365,"“I'm not sure what the other reviewers tolerance levels are, but mine is pretty high. Sorry to say, this strain is mediocre at best. If this is a creeper, it creeps slower than a sloth. Taste is ok. I couldn't taste or feel the indica that it claims to be. Since my dispensary just released this strain, I'm hoping it'll get better and more potent in future harvests. But as for right now, this strain should be called ch...”"
