Saturn OG
=============
RDMcomposer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1370126,"“Thoroughly impressed; left me feeling happy without being overwhelming; mildly hungry but not out of control. Started out with an intense burst of whoah that gave way to hilarious entertainment and stress relief. So good I went back to the same dispensary only to find that it had vanished shortly after I had the pleasure of acquiring some. Highly recommended.”"
Dankdank77,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1370127,"“Very fun strain, if your sensitive to anxiety this is safe... not too overwhelming, hits kinda hard at first follwed by calm. Makes you hungry and giggly. 5 star indica for sure. 😄”"
alliealc,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1419586,"“A great strain to smoke if you want to relax by yourself or chat it up with friends.  Gives off a nice balance of a body and head high.  Helps me most with depression, as it leaves me feeling extraordinarily happy and calm, even until the next day.”"
bluecyborg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1327998,"“Very earthy smell with a peppery taste in your nose/throat. Sooooo relaxing but also good for conversation. Definitely a favorite. 

note: hits hard and fast, so I wouldn't recommend this to someone looking for a "light" high.”"
sluggo13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1327997,"“very stinky, potent and great for relaxing at home, undwinding and.chatting with friends at the end of the day for of smoke. og kush stankkk”"
IntrusDave,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1360582,"“This strain blew my mind. I was hoping for a relaxed evening and good night sleep. What I ended up with was 3 hours of being totally freaked out, and my body twitching uncontrollably. This seems like a strain that needs to be used very gently. I'll give it one more try, but maybe just one puff and wait an hour.”"
WillysWonder1129,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1327996,"“This strain starts you off with a strong sativa high and fades into a nice relaxing indica high”"
JerseyScribe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1326889,"“spacy, existential high with many properties. Big head rush after smoking calms into a nice relaxing high, albeit making me very talkative.”"

Malformedllama,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1218984,"“Pretty good strain. Left me with a very quiet high because I was lost in my own thoughts (and I was with someone else so it was kinda awkward) Take this strain by yourself!”"

DeciduousKill,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1131144,"“Got to try this out yesterday. The smell is VERY strong. It's covered with frosty trichomes and orange hairs. After the first bong rip, I was already feeling great. Very potent. Will definitely have to get my hands on this bud again.”"
goCannaOne,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1235553,"“A++

To me, the saturn is a smaller more dense version than the Jupiter, but perhaps thats just my farmer's cuts. In any case, has the traditional OG stink, and the high off the Saturn is REALLY heavy. 

You WILL, knock out. And if you dont, KUDOS to you, sir/maam”"
phirouzeh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1314320,"“This indica really treats me well. Very helpful with helping me sleep, which is what I most often use indicas for. I went back to the club to stock up. It might be my new favorite strain.”"
sluggo13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1223831,"“great og hybrid.”"
boyndog,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1605426,"“A very good strain.  The high is floaty -- euphoric and soft -- almost rolling across your mind in gentle waves.  What I would call a 'blisser'.  Great for the end of the day as you transition from your work strains into your evening or sleep strains.”"
Saulcc93,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1754789,"“La probé en edición especial Saturn Cannabis Cup Gold Edition con infusión de rosin, la boquilla tiene control de flujo de aire, es “pesado” el vapor que produce y se siente profundo en los pulmones después inhalar.
Al exhalar da un sabor terroso en la lengua y una sensación cítrica en toda la vía respiratoria, siempre me hace toser.
Se siente un adormecimiento del cuerpo que me relaja al igual que disminuye el zumbi...”"

oneandone,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1410522,"“Been on a major OG kick lately. Most but not all have the effects I am looking for in a strain. I really enjoy the cerebral effects you get but then the effects I really enjoy kick in, full body relaxation, alleviation of stress, and help with insomnia.”"

chiefbigbong,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1745813,"“A remarkably powerful and enjoyable strain, Saturn OG is a hybrid with a strong indica lean.

The head high is dreamy and somewhat heavy, sending me off to a distant headspace and filling me with an immense sense of ease and contentment.

The body high is powerful and relaxing with only minor couchlock and munchies. Perfect for lounging around the house or winding down before bed. Also great for pain relief.

Not rec...”"

951stilltripping,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/saturn-og/reviews/1275800,"“Great great great night strain, smell very loud, full of diesel hints to it. Beautiful looking dark green fat nugs. It would knock you down to sleep if you oversmoke it which is very easy to. If you having a 2-3 hours smoking session, I recommend starting with 2 bowls of this strain & smoke joints or small bowls of some other hybrid strains to add up or prolonging your session instead. This strain is similar to gdp, ...”"
