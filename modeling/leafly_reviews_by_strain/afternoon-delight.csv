UniverseAccordingtoRob,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afternoon-delight/reviews/1380527,"“A strain for the connoisseur. This strain stands out amongst the 250 strains that I have enjoyed over the years. Potent, intoxicating, narcotic. Truly, it engulfed my mind in a lucid, hypnotic trance that brought me to the edge of enlightenment and expanded my consciousness. I have been medicating for a long time.

One of the few strains with a dominant apple flavor, this fruit forward dense flower is an indica dominant so be wary not to smoke too much in the afternoon unless you're looking for some serious couch time.

Look- Very beautiful, dense, light green, large nugs. The second you grind it the aroma fills the room. Love it. It grinds extremely well. Not too fluffy and not too dense to where the grind is too fine. Perfect for rolling blunts with good airflow.

Smoke- smooth but kicks ya, you should feel this right off the bat. 

Feel- This gives you an uplifted feel, l...”"

Meow4me420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afternoon-delight/reviews/1319272,"“Like being rocked to relaxation by Mother earth. It's sweet & relaxing when you exhale, like a literal breathe of fresh air. It also packs a heavy high, but not so much that you're couch locked or get the sweats.”"

Smokinowl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afternoon-delight/reviews/1365567,"“Third best I've ever had. (First is tangerine dream, second is moui woui and third is this.) really strong, very floral and herbal smell (like dried rosemary) and the cerebral high is killer. You need a little more to get super fucked but it's really good.”"

A great vanilla spicy flavor and immediate heady high. Alsmost like another dimension. Lol visual stimulation for sure. Get strain for a stressful day as all thoughts become nonsensical lol its definitely top shelf strong sativa leaning /indica hybrid.”"
Snakeskins,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afternoon-delight/reviews/1667961,"“I get this strain for $14.99 an eighth at my dispensary without complaining about a few seeds. 
What I get is a superb price but a very mellow and sluggish kind of high. I'm not one to complain about weed that works but this gets me tired. With 0% cbd and the name of the strain I expected different.”"
