I start to feel my neck become warm and my head are light ! this is a very good muscle relaxant and perfect  for light to medium pain. be careful. the biggest side effect is MUNCHIES !! SUGAR !!”"
tomburry,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1410398,"“Got this strain and was instantly tooken aback by how crystal-y it was. The nugs were tight and, quite literally, FROSTED with a beautiful layer of sparkling THC. First hit out of the bong was smooth and very good tasting. This is a strong indica so it has some couch lock effects, but overall very enjoyable. Happy, euphoric, music sounded very good.

Beware tho! You MUST be around a copious amount of food when consum...”"
emmabacs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1236187,"“great strain (almost) overall. flavor and smell are quite sweet and minty, very pleasant. the high of this itself is relaxing, euphoric, though mood swings may occur. paranoia was a frequent negative side effect, though not many others were noticed. on the bright side, this strain definitely helps with a low appetite, along with my menstrual cramps I've found as well, and made me a whole load happier.”"
Mastergrow,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1280730,"“I am growing this strain in my backyard. From three plants one of them was male and chopped it down. The other three are growing and are in their 5 week of flowering. One of the plants is growing thin, very crystaly, but high leaf to bud ratio. The other two are just growing fat tight buds in every internode. One of the plants has gone purple and had a strong sweet berry flavor. The other one is growing with fat tigh...”"

I have also grew white widow and that was hard as hell but candy cane will put you to sleep like a baby.

RedwoodBurl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1538604,"“I grew several plants outdoors last season. Beautiful plant. Wonderful aroma. It is so relaxing, not a sedative thing, relaxing as in clearing the mind of stress ... and the body too. Nice strain to hang out with. You'll head to dreamland later, again not because you're drugged asleep but because you're so stress free. It's a wonderful strain for making edibles. I'll grow it again.”"

Bootlegks,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1203589,"“I grew this strain this Spring. It has a wonderful white and red dusting of resins and hairs that make for beautiful buds. A little skunky , but the taste is of sweet mango and a little mint floral taste. The high is euphoric and uplifting. Makes me a little creative and energy high versus the couch effect. Low stress and relaxing. I liked this strain , will grow again.”"
SomethingFire,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1277843,"“10/10 stars for this excellent strain, which is just screaming THC! Instant high for the body, instant high for the mind. Candy Cane produces a very sweet smell and taste just as Candy lol. Very stone high, but when indulging this strain be sure to have a maximum supply around of munchies because the hunger will never end!”"
LAqua,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1800198,"“I purchased this in a vape cartridge by amber industries out of California & I opened the tube & it really smells like candy canes..... 
upon the first hit it’s def candy cane & wow an instant breath mint taste! I’m gonna have to try the flower to see if the taste is as good..
This strain would make a great edible choice!
It’s def a indica & a total relaxed pain free high...”"
madmaxoregon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1202190,"“Outstanding strain.  Large meaty buds with little stem.  Hits one like a firecracker.  Bam and it is on.  I recommend this strain for pain and also for creativity.   If you can, get some.”"

r1z0n,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1213805,"“This is a great bud! It has a delish smell that keeps you wanting more! It has a nice candy taste but leaves the tip of your joint full of residue.  The result is a great body high but keeps your mind racing.  Overall a wonderful indica strain for sativa lovers!”"

Never mind.”"
bufu20111,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1207430,"“I've grown three of these so far and while I love the high, it gives me the super munchies. I mean like, drop kick the Cookie Monster and take his cookies, kinda munchies. While the plant was easy to grow, I noticed two ways it grew. The first plant produced whispy thin buds, could be grower error, and the other two had a high leaf to bud ratio. That took a lot of time trimming, also could be grower error.”"

I had 4 of them now three because one of them happened to be a male plant. The plants grow short, about 2 feet max. One of the plants has been growing thin buds with high leaf to bud ratio. Another one is growing perfect and is turning quite purple, due to mid 50s night temperature. The third one is bigger and it's going to produce much more. I am running sugar ...”"

The fact that it smells like mango and white widow astounds me then it has that Ak-47 as a beautiful 3rd Strain mix!   The indica dominates the cerebrel sensation and all the pain in my mind drifts away! :)”"
Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1342984,"“This Candy Cane Strain is too indica for me...saving grace is the creative mind state and bit giggly. A bit of paranoia for me and spacey/sleepy. And man...thirsty”"

skittle021,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1515816,"“Really nice, relaxing strain. Helps mildly with pain, but mostly for stress and insomnia. I struggle with falling asleep and staying asleep, and this fixes that right up. It doesn’t make you “sleepy”, per se, it just helps clear your mind so that you can chill out and drift away. I’ve had a couple issues with paranoia while using this blend, but nothing too bad.”"
Kavvi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/candy-cane/reviews/1261492,"“I'm high right now. Took a lot. This strain is making me paranoid. I can't tell which direction sounds are coming from, or how close the thing that's making them is. Smoked this to get sleepy as I'm having trouble falling asleep but I feel quite jumpy. The body high is nice, though, and the stuff's potent.”"
