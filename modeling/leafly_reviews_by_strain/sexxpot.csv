Felt very high but could still be productive... good mood, finding everything more interesting... I'd definitely recommend this for someone looking for a good hybrid, party weed, or for creative activities.”"

This is the only strain I have found so far that helps relive my muscle pain without causing a headache. I vape and this strain gives me a nice fuzzy feeling where I get relief even after the high wears off. Recommend this strain to others suffering muscle spasms, and "triggers".”"
