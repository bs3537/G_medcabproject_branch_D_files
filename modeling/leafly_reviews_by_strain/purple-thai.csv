Samsunflower,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-thai/reviews/1417193,"“I was pleasantly surprised with this strain. Prior to smoking it, I was struggling with anxiety and panic attacks. By the time I was done, all I could think about were new paintings and art to create. It put me in such a good mood man.”"
danweb66,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-thai/reviews/1368779,"“was very purple. had a sweet chocolate smell. very potent brought me back to when I was younger.”"
danweb66,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-thai/reviews/1362103,"“Very strong front lobal high. was very purple, was first time I've ever seen this strain. smelled very much like chocolate thai just fruitier. unified collective hooked it up.”"
capacity38,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-thai/reviews/1626928,"“Throw this in with some of the other PTS sativas for an energetic smack in the face. Love their effort to really bring about classic strains that are either landrace or hybrids of landraces. Columbian Gold, Brazil Amazonia, Wild Thai and 1024 sativas from PTS are far and beyond the best sativas I've had. Green crack by gold leaf is right up there as well, but the PTS consistency is fantastic.”"

Booboo24,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-thai/reviews/1788759,"“Woo! This was beautiful. I don’t give many strains five starts but pt deserves it. And it’s got a cool name. Great for socialising. 
We went to the lake with a joint of this and all the heron birds started swimming near us in the night it was cool and weird like purple Thai.”"

I suffer from depression so feeling that kind of happiness, like pure and real happiness, is something that very rarely happens for me so this was a nice surprise. I bought a gram on a whim and ended up going back for an eighth. 
I’d definitely recommend this to anyone looking to combat the winter blues or...”"

What I really like is the focus and the mellow I get--Purple Thai's not an overly cerebral strain to me (Durban Poison winds me up too tight, makes me too chatty and brain buzzy) so its a really good daytime strain for folks like myself! I dig the mild purple/chocolatey/earthyness, too!”"
