Antique-Toy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1169868,"“Upon my trip to Germany with my band, we happened to get hold of someone that grew this strain. The strain made our stay in Germany the best part of our tour, because we stayed outside in parks just making music all day for our entire stay. Excellent for outdoor stoners.”"
Irish91,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1356466,"“This is one of my absolute favorite strains to date. I smoke everyday and this is the cheapest stuff at the dispensary i go to (Sun Valley Caregivers) and its my favorite. $20 bucks an eight on happy hour, hellz yea. The high is really cheery and uplifting. I vaped it and the high lasts about 1.5-2 hrs. Pick some up to try it atleast once, and turn on some Bob Marley or The Expendables and just enjoy :]”"
Tathagata,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1414959,"“I was lucky enough to first try this strain about 9 years ago. The smell of the herb had a pleasant sweet spiciness, but nothing remarkable. It was well flushed and cured, and had a light, sweet taste with no harshness.

I have never since experienced such a relieving calm from any other strains. It was like the herb had removed a heavy jacket of stress and worry, which I was previously unaware of wearing. I was livi...”"
ThaBlasian206,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1371428,"“Some very medical stuff. After using this strain I immediately felt I could use the day to do anything I wanted and had no anxiety about any upcoming bull the world wanted to hand to me today. I definitely feel more creative and also more focused and a great urge to learn more about things I like and indulge in hobbies. Last time I remember feeling like this is when I took one pill of an anti-anxiety Klonopin way bac...”"

I mainly smoke Indica strains but decided to try a Sativa this time round. Its a creeper, so after smoking, it takes about 10 minutes for the high to kick in, but when it does - its amazing. Its a very sleepy, relaxing high, stress relieving, but no couch lock, you should still be able to use your mobile phone, watch tv, have a shower etc...”"
vet,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1356465,"“hello leafologists hah. picked up 1/4 oz of this for $30 a gram. not bad. first off let me start off by saying, i am a legal patient with a prescription. one thing i picked up on during my time as a solider was a good nose. let me tell you that Jamaican Pearl is probably one of a kind. it smelled deeply of Kentucky blue grass blended with store-brand dark chocolate chip cookies. May not sound all that impressive but ...”"
SamSimnitt,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1064080,"“Super euphoric, happy high. Bud looks really natural and weak but tears you apart. Extraordinary feeling of happiness, like paradise, one of my all time favorites.”"
Somchai,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1414960,"“Exceptionally up-lifting. It feels like your in the Caribbean straight chilling within an abode made of sand. Aw yes, the Gold pineapple sun just soaking the body warm with rays. Seriously awesome positive feel. You can see why the Rastafarians like to smoke BECAUSE of this. Reggae good for the soul mon.”"

VillieG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1356520,"“A truly amazing strain devoid of any negative psychological effects. Clear headed wonderfulness without being useless to the world haha Medicinal to the MAX,,,,,If it is ever in concentrated form GET IT!!!”"
Profighle,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1414963,"“I do outdoor grows.

Time: Ready mid november, finish in the greenhouse.
Plant formation: swinging and slender sativa.
Bud formation: Compact buds, small trichomes. 
Growth issues: not mold resistent from mid oct to finish, not suitable for low ceilings when finishing indoors.
Interestingly, for a sativa she can take a lot of fertilizer.

Taste: herby, earthy, very soft tones of chocolate and berry, but spiciness rul...”"
NoahDakota,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1064076,"“Very good Strain, I felt so chill. I smoked it from a blunt, so the taste of the wrap made this taste even better. I recommend this for chillin' and just being happy.

I highly recommend this Strain. (:”"
Irish91,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1356522,"“Initial smoke was very light. Not harsh at all and very easy on my lungs. High is very cerebral and clear but is making me a little spacey. Not very potent , but the high is pretty enjoyable. Takes away the urge to smoke a bunch more.  At first i would have rated this a 6 or 7, but i have to give it an 8 due to how good the high is for a sativa.  Smoothness and taste are two of the best qualities of the Pearl.”"
420ishh,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1064075,"“A very slender, prickly, unassuming looking flower that packs some serious flavor and cerebral head lift. 

Its fruity, earth smell and haze-type taste makes you want to smoke this everyday!

Perfect uplifting feeling to start your day.”"
mojodope,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1201901,"“Its a fruity, juicy dope, nice smoking and it makes you just happy about life and gives you creative ideas.”"
carlsagan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1356521,"“It's an actual good strain, the crop I got was really leafy. But otherwise it was dank, the flavors didn't really come out though. But the medicinal effects did really shine through. It's a perfect all day smoke. Since there is some indica you do get some of the indica benefits if you smoke all day eventually you are going to end up sleeping peacefully. This is a nice wake and bake day time high bud, it's good to smo...”"
Irish91,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1064077,"“When speaking strictly sativa, this is some top shelf.  Second time smoking was honestly even better than my first time.”"

jakebogo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1374226,"“DUDE.  One quarter of this strain will GIVE YOU 3-4 BOWLS OF KEEF.  The weed is alright by itself but it's like 50% keef so you should smoke each bowl with leaf on bottom and keef on top.  Rail it.  

Only reason for 4/5 stars is that I've smoked stronger sativa.  Still, hail this keef machine.”"

Sativasurfer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1503273,"“This strain was marketed as being suited perfectly for outdoor growing in UK. Well it certainly isn't. The plants didn't flower in time, buds were small and undeveloped and suffered from severe mould at the first sign of damp weather. Threw it all in the bin after masses of cost, work and effort. Last time I buy from these over-priced bullshitters.”"

Bart8888,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1744361,"“Excellent outdoor strain. Probably second best outdoor strain  from Sensi Seeds after Durban. The genetics behind Jamaican Pearl are top-notch, especially the Marley's Colley which is a cross of a Mazar-i-Sharif from Sensi, Maple Leaf Indica, with Jamaican. This is then crossed with Early Pearl. Nice and breezy up-high with Afghan undertones. Hand rub hash gives you AAA-grade tropical charas!!! Very nice strain!!”"

ynotwbc,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1609544,"“This is a belting strain! Really social and giggly and conversational and focused. I find that it has a very mellow and relaxed tail on it after about an hour. So keep smoking it if you want to keep up that sativa element. My buds are beautiful looking; pink, purple and green and blanket covered in crystals. Definitely a top shelf sativa!”"

A delight experience perfect for the night.”"
Cloudsdale,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1064106,"“Average effects for this strain, for me anyway. Relaxing more in the head than the body, it is definitely a more cerebral high. I found myself thinking in different ways, stirring up different corners of creativity. Fun enough joints, it's nice but not very strong.”"

DamienDarke,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-pearl/reviews/1356527,"“After I smoked this, I was instantly wanting to make stuff to smoke more out of.  I ended up building a water-bong out of a Super Soaker.  We called it the "Shotgun", because you would pump it to collect the smoke after it was lit, and you pulled the trigger to shoot out the smoke.  It was like getting a shotgun out of the end of a blunt, hence the name.  My alltime second favorite weed, next to Northern Lights #5.  ...”"
