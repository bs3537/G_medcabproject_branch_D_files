Nikond300,https://www.leafly.com/indica/haoma/reviews/1178632,"“Having MS, this is a great, relaxing daytime use strain for me.”"
eeyamamoto,https://www.leafly.com/indica/haoma/reviews/1179152,"“I'm pretty high. watching hitchcock movies without sound. my brain slows down. lots of thoughts with no conclusions. impretty sure its a question. its taking me forever to type this review. any how, I'm SUPER Add right now. I can't finish anything, just jumping from on stimuli to the next.”"
fundy2017,https://www.leafly.com/indica/haoma/reviews/1626461,"“The haoma has really helped my degenerative disc and joint disease. It helps with my muscle spasms. The Dankery has medical patients in mind when cultivating their products. High CBD stains that really help me as I'm an older patient and still likes to smoke. 😊”"
PocketKafka,https://www.leafly.com/indica/haoma/reviews/1217243,"“Haoma really mellows you out, but for me is very tiring.  Once I smoke it, it's definitely time for bed!  This strain hits fast.”"

KyleFromVanIsle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/haoma/reviews/1211285,"“A very fragrant and tasty strain  :) 

Nice buzz that hits you quickly, lasts for hours and is felt "in the eyes" for sure. 

I'm recreational but I'm sure I've benefitted medicinally from cannabis - perhaps without even knowing it!

If you can find some Haoma, try it. I am confident you'll like it.”"
KyleFromVanIsle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/haoma/reviews/1544760,"“Since I posted my comments, I have never seen Haoma available again. I wish this strain would get more exposure - it's cannabis all should get the chance to try!”"
canadiangirl25,https://www.leafly.com/indica/haoma/reviews/1304226,"“OMG loved this strain so much! such a good night time strain and tastes delicious!”"
VanAskMe,https://www.leafly.com/indica/haoma/reviews/1205176,"“It's calming, a really nice blend of flavorful smoke and mellow relaxation.”"
