A lovely balanced cerebral & body high that allows me to either sink into the couch and watch a movie, or get up and get going. I love the creative focus this strain gives me without even a hint of anxiety. Great for reading!”"

It makes me feel like a milli bucks and gives me the motivation to rock some socks in the octagon. The flavor reminds me of eating a raw cactus mixed with buttered popcorn.”"

First, I'm a naturally anxious person with high anxiety amongst other things. i was worried because the negatives are way elevated in the anxiety area. I'm halfway thru my eighth (2 days) and I have had zero issues with any anxious feelings. It definitely shows it's sativa side about 20 minutes in but in a fun active way.

KidGalaxy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cactus-cooler/reviews/1627404,"“I got a sativa Cactus Cooler, and it did not do very much, sadly.  I thought it would taste like Cactus Cooler, the soft drink, pinapple and orange flavor, but it tasted more like an actual cactus.  
So, unfortunately, I have a 4.5 grams of this stuff, and I wish there were trade-ins at ye olde weed store. Maybe the hybrid version is the one to get....”"
