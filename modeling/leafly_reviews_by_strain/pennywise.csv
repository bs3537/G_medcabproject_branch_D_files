Pennywise
=============
karlwireless,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1417437,"“Here we go.  So this Pennywise was a 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD (9% of each to be exact) so then.  Very cautious about taking anything with THC in it, or high amounts for sure, so Pennywise seemed like a good alternative to some others out there.  It was a very mellow feeling....no racing heart just calm.  No heavy headed feeling either.  What a bonus there.  Definitely will use again.”"
chronic.cooking,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1413850,"“This is easily the best strain I've ever smoked, medicinally or recreationally, and I've smoked for 10 years. In terms of my conditions, I find this strain eliminates my chronic nerve pain, especially the breakthrough pain, and does absolute wonders on my anxiety. The 1:1 THC:CBD content really makes it the most effective for both of my conditions. It improves my mood dramatically and leaves me with a lot more cognit...”"
dakdso,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1410425,"“My favorite strain so far. I suffer from depression and an anxiety disorder, and this strain treats both. Made me feel very relaxed with just a little head buzz. High in CBD is the way to go for me. Definitely recommend for anxiety and depression.”"
PhantomSpaceman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1416571,"“Pennywise is the strain that changed my life. It's the first cannabis I've used in four years. I stopped because I had started having anxiety attacks every time I was high. It didn't take many times for that to scare me off.

I have anxiety and depression, and it's such a relief to have found Pennywise. I felt nothing but positive impact on my chemicals after sipping vapor for a steady two hours. I paced myself and f...”"
dakdso,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1410258,"“My favorite strain so far. I suffer from depression and anxiety, which quadruples with PMDD (a severe form of PMS) every month. This strain helps with all three. Felt very relaxed with very little head buzz. I highly recommend this strain for those who prefer the medical benefits this strain provides and still have a clear head.”"
Stryps,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1417629,"“Pennywise has been my go-to strain for Cluster Headache pain management. I have debilitating headaches that come on within minutes, or wake me from a deep sleep, and reach a pain level of around 8 to 10 very rapidly. The extreme pain can make me very nauseous, restless, and anxious if left untreated.

At the first sign of a headache, I vaporize about 200mg of finely ground bud, and within seconds I am feeling real pa...”"

I got some Pennywise BHO on 4/20/15 and it showed me nature put a safe painkiller in a flower — and it's called Cannabis, not Opium Poppy!  I'd just been diagnosed with shoulder tendinitis, and that's on top of widespread pain from fibromyalgia and TMJ issues with muscular pain in face/jaw/neck and occasional tension headaches.

casparproject,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1416572,"“This is a very important medicinal strain.  The calming and anti-inflammatory effects from the CBD are very strong, and while the THC is still present in an even ratio, it's effects are very clearly being modulated towards the more "healing" side than the "high" side.  The aroma is skunky, with a hint of woodiness.  The flavour of the vapour was earthy and spicey, reminiscent of its Jack Herer parentage.  It's name i...”"

I deal with degenerative joint disease, degenerative disc disease, and PTSD.  Pharmaceutical medicines often don't agree with me (and usually don't work, and have awful side effects).

Swede,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1410061,"“Here is another good one! 1:1 strain which helps with pain and nerves. This is also a night strain, you'll want to hit the bed within an hour or two. If you are looking for a night time strain which is high in CBD, this is a good one! Oh, and NO anxiety or parinoid feeling at all. It reminds me of a Mars OG with a hint of GDP.”"
OldRocker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1369361,"“An amazing strain but take it easy as a little pinch goes a long ways. It hits quick, not a creeper.  An awesome  male and female aphrodisiac. Immediate erection and multi enhanced orgasm for both me and the wife. Happy uplifted feeling, but not for daytime use.  Sit back and relax...because you're not wanting to go far away from your lady...the fridge and the bed.”"

Those are the kind of tinctures I buy so I figured I'd give Pennywise a try. BEST STRAIN I've used for rheumatoid arthritis.  It provides rapid relief and unlocks any stuck joints within 15 minutes.

The smoke is mild, not too harsh and the buzz is rather even and smooth, even though it crept up, the on set was slower than most creeper strains.

This is a good cbd strain and I found  it to be a manageable high without pulling me down with paranoia or getting me way to high. 
Every penny counts but pennywise is even better stuff, I love it!
I can afford to get high on this again with no worries.”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1282126,"“Since I don't. smoke to relieve physical symptoms, just mental, I found this strain to be on the weaker side.  It would be perfect if you need pain relief without the strong mental high. It is relaxing, but that's about it for me. This would be perfect medication for those who need it, just not for me.”"
chicanaqueen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1325378,"“Good strain for pain, social anxiety, and general anxiety. Very relaxing strain. Light taste. You can hardly smell this one. Gives me the munchies big time though.”"
TikkunOlam,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1365184,"“Bland, with less pronounced flavor and effects than other CBD strains I've tried. This was my second chance purchase (different grower and dispensary) and I'm still not impressed. A recent gram of Critical Mass CBD was far superior, tasty with 24% CBD!”"

CBDBurner,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1387385,"“I love pennywise it's the perfect balance. This strain can be smoked morning day or night. I'm always n a real good mood relaxed and pain free when I smoke pennywise. At home on the go doesn't matter it's the best cbd strain I've ever smoked.”"
jenmars62,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1386309,"“Five hours later still stoned.  My brw favorite.  Made cannabis infused tea and bam. Painfree for hours.  Nice body and head high. Will definitely buy again.”"
RyZen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1411904,"“For a high CBD strain, Pennywise is pretty good. It will keep you mellow all day and it really calms anxiety. If you're a light or newbie smoker this strain will give you  a mild buzz and will leave you functional. A great strain to smoke for the medical benefits or for newbies getting into smoking the herb.”"
PNA808,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1484879,"“Absolutely my most favorite strain. Wonderful during the evening right after work & right before my shower. I can easily smoke bowls of this all night long & goof off with my family. I’m more interested in what everyone’s doing & more silly which my family seems to love. ZERO anxiety or paranoia which is A+ for me. I have complete control over my body and thoughts, while enjoying a subtle body high. It’s perfect for ...”"
munnin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1196933,"“Smaller bud, indicative of a aero/hydro grow.  Really sticky, lots of brownish/orange hairs.  Smells of lemon furniture polish (Pledge).  Nice draw.  Initial taste of pine/earth aftertaste berry/citrus.  I would recommend this for PTSD and other anxiety disorders.  Leaves you feeling content and  able to face the day.  Not the best for insomnia.  It is relaxing, but I find that it doesn't hold a candle to any kush.  ...”"

idont,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1343358,"“This is the worst CBD strain I have ever tried. It got me high and now my night is ruined. .97% THC 20.03% CBD. I also had a strong reaction to Jack The Ripper which is one of the parents with that one. If I was sick and had cancer maybe but not good for me for back pain and anxiety.”"

xxruby,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1372253,"“This strain, though high in CBD, still produces more of a head high than I expected, which made Beijing Hot Pot night a bit more interesting than I intended for. Let's just say there were no leftovers. I felt really relaxed and thoughtful and worked well for my pain. I prefer the mama strain, though (Harlequin) to this one.”"

ecnalubma,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1372254,"“Clear and mellow stone with a slow onset of a heavy body and an immediate sense of chillax. The analgesic and relaxing properties of the CBD rich Harlequin mother come through nicely and the invigorating pep you get from the JTR high makes this an amazing all day smoke for with real medicinal value.
Taste/Aroma: Phenotypes range from a fresh ground coffee/pepper to a lemon bubblegum. The smoke is harsh and irritates ...”"
leenbeens,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1292952,"“I fell in love with this strain before I knew it was a cbd only strain. It has such a clean taste when smoked. No harshness, just totally yummy flavor. I love this strain for migraines, nausea, anxiety and insomnia. It knocks out what ails you and leaves you feeling uplifted and peaceful.”"
darthcricket,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pennywise/reviews/1372252,"“Pennywise does't hit as hard on the front end as Harlequin; but the pain management and the energized effects, though definitely present, don't seem to run as deep for the duration, as the Harlequin's does.

Definitely a day time treat for pain relief, when I don't have the time to get through 30-45 minutes of the front-end high.”"
