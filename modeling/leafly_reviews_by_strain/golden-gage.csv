This strain was fast acting, powerful and long lasting, not recommended for beginners but highly recommended for seasoned hybrid fans.  Perfect for Phish shows, hiking, skiing and yoga.”"

At first it gave me a little anxiety but I was able to direct it into production as I danced and laughed. House of cultivar has an amazing concentrate tasting like pineapple kush. Woooo-hooo! For good tasting strains that feel awesome. Definitely getting again.”"

The sweet Yet piney Taste caked the top of my mouth only briefly but surprisingly satisfying nonetheless. My Wife , Our Friend and Myself found ourselves engaged in goofy conversations while reliving past moments . This is surely a crowd pleaser if your looking for a Social Bud with a great Taste!”"
