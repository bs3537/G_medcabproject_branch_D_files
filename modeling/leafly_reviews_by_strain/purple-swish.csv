Smokinsince95,https://www.leafly.com/indica/purple-swish/reviews/1526026,"“This is an amazing strain for bedtime and has one of the best "purple" flavors out there...hence the name I guess. I like this to relax and ease my mind and to enjoy something different from time to time. It's a heavy heady Indica for sure and also one of the most beautiful flowers I've seen. I want to grow this strain SOOO BAD!!”"
