BlazedDiesel,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-technology/reviews/1450149,"“Buds are super keefy, has a very herbal wood like aroma, tastes pretty good and definitely has a nice relaxing high, but not so strong that you can't go about your daily activities. Can't go wrong with this strain if you like a stimulating body high”"

After picking up this strain from my “local” farm my fiancé was a little frustrated cause I would pass out within 30 minutes of smoking a bowl, didn’t realize it was the Alien Tech  👽 until the 4th day.

13Murphy74,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-technology/reviews/1375754,"“Picked up a 1gram MEDI VapeRX of this strain with really hogh hopes as the container said 79.27% THC and really high levels of THCA and CBD... The smoke i usually buy ranges from 18 to 30% so I was really excited about these high percentages. overall I can't say that I didn't get high because I got stoned but it took about six or seven hits off my vape pen, definitely not worth the $50 a g,”"
CarlosN,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-technology/reviews/1609104,"“Great smell. Solid nugs. Sweet flavors, notes of caramel. Effects set in relatively quickly, overall one I look forward to again.”"
warzone13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/alien-technology/reviews/1631871,"“This is a good indica, relaxing without being debilitating so you can still focus. I wasn't a fan of the harsh, petrol-like aftertaste but that's just a personal preference. The buds looked great, light green, fluffy and with a nice sprinkling of orange stigmas.”"
