Got me having a blast playing with the kids, CREATIVE FOR SURE. Music is awesome. This would be great for a concert or to paint, or leave reviews apparently.  4 stars for the snap crack and pops upon lighting up bowl. Yet too spark a J, but this is like fireworks. Great deal though.  ~Jaime~”"
KelChemist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/marcosus-marshmellow/reviews/1600335,"“This strain is a miracle for MS muscle spasms and neuropathy.
When the muscle spasms start, one hit and instant relief. If the spasms got going before taking a hit, it takes a few to stop them.
This strain has AWESOME medical benefits.
It's just hard to find at times. So...PLEASE GROW SOME...Anyone!”"

Sonofabrokenman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/marcosus-marshmellow/reviews/1413960,"“these new strains keep a coming. This looks funky and has an odd taste. minty sort of. Chemical caca, I dont care for these hybrids myself, overall not bad, the buzz has some good mind effects, with a slight burnout on the end. Overall blahhh....”"
