KingKush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1382645,"“Blue Champagne is PURE and AMAZING. Its Blue Dream's Rich Cousin and that's what I love :)”"
bigrich,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1340220,"“at a low/moderate dose it puts you in a great mood that, but does so very subtly. it doesn't bring attention to itself, it just does its job! felt very social so maybe good for anxiety.”"
azviejo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1386637,"“This is definitely a 5 star strain. Unfortunately it is difficult to find. I've been using Blue Champagne to manage pain from back surgery and arthritis for several years and get excellent results. It also has a fresh aroma and smokes smoothly.”"
rocker1052,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1245884,"“Was high on an indica all day... Took one drag out of this and I was awake and focused again! Love the taste, and the cerebral high from this is just too amazing.”"
ombeppe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1355375,"“If you love Blue Dream, than this is for you! 
Pretty dense nugs with the just enough sweet aroma tempting even the pickiest patients. 
The nice crisp smoke leaves a smatter of the champagne at the end. 
Good medicine for soul and mind!”"
BurnSlo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1387549,"“WHHHHAT! This is Blue Dream's sister from another mister. Fantastic smell it takes you back to the day you smelt Blue Dream. Flowers resemble its twin but covered in more frosting,and with those light pale orange hairs that's classic to the BD trait. Champagne taste battles BD in your mouth. Until you are left with Mother Earths sweet tears of laughter in your mouth. That something can be just as good its parent, whi...”"
Kaz412,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1339223,"“This is a top tier strain. I love taking a few hits kicking back and playing some Battlefield 1. Good energy and no crazy munchies.”"
Grateful3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1061988,"“Nice upbeat effect, great for anxiety or stress....Enjoyed socially awkward situations without a second thought!”"
SemperObscurus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1288819,"“Puts you at about 3/4ths speed. Solid euphoria high, gets me in my head, loosens the subconscious for creativity, but can sometimes turn to paranoia. I say the risk is minimal. Good with friends/significant others.”"
ScottishToker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1208962,"“This has got to be one of my favourite strains ! It tastes very earthy and it's very smooth. The exhale tastes sweet . The high was very pleasant it made me extremely relaxed and care free but kept me very focused all at the same time ! 5/5”"
CabriniGreeny,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1327703,"“One of the best "day time" strains I've ever smoked. A great cerebral high.”"

JaeDaVinci,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1346241,"“Very bright and airy high. This one is light enough for wake and bake but can be heavy for a knockout if you smoke enough. No couch lock here I was productive and motived to take on the day.”"
TheDankestBrother,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1355377,"“Shit is fire.

Rocko324,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1364356,"“Blue Champagne is definitely a night time smoke sesh. I love the smell let alone taste of this bud and I smoke it every night before I go to sleep. Blue Dream being my favorite strain, Blue Champagne is a close second!”"
Xanadab,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1618195,"“The bud I bought was a bit old and dry but it still got me exceptionally high. Nice job! Definitely sativa dominant. Starts out happy and moves into full blown sativa buzz. I think this would serve patients with depression well if they micro-dose this one. Paranoia level: 2/10.”"

Tengukashi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1061996,"“Blue Champagne (Blue Dream X Champagne Kush) is one fine strain. When these sticky, dense, vivid green buds are ground up, they release the classic blueberry and spice scent of the Blue Dream, along with a hint of a tingling in the nose from the Champagne Kush. The taste is a little diminished, though nothing to scoff at. I was pretty good. Moving onto the high, it's very mellow, perfect focus medicine. The perfect c...”"

Sharon1Harrison,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1061994,"“It immediately reminded me of hash taste and hash buzz.  Very intense high very heady.”"
scubagoodingjr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1252641,"“Not to bad but i got at the same time as the Black Berry Kush so i was a little spoiled. I give it a strong 4 for its nice appearance and taste but it was a little bit to water based for me. It wasnt bad though.”"

prettiehippie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1418272,"“When I bought this it was labeled as Blueberry Champagne, but I'm assuming it's the same. It's my fav strain I've ever tried so far! Gives an amazing head high, almost psychedelic and makes you feel as if you're floating. A little goes a long way. Amazing!!”"
BobCantwell,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1127710,"“The blue champagne at Einstein's Buds is rumored to be Jesus's fave. Leaves him with a major smile and no couch lock!”"
EasternEasy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1320724,"“Excellent hybrid.  Very fast cerebral onset, and long lasting.  Bit of a body stone comes on later, but an excellent long lasting strain that is best enjoyed with friends.”"
LBwreck,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1338231,"“Blue Champagne is a great day starter. I know, I started my day with this wonderful strain and I must admit only a fool would complain!

How do you think I got the energy to get up and get out for some urgent must do errands?

This Blue Champagne is not for the kids – it’s for grown-ups silly. Smoking this bud will inspire you to make and close deals.

What a beautiful plant Blue Champagne is…not only does it k...”"

Vitalsine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-champange/reviews/1131646,"“I was very excited to try this one out. It had a pungent blueberry order that you could smell from across the room when you opened the jar. Buds were tight and icy. Tasted very reminiscent of blue dream, very sweet. Little harsh, not bad though. Nice change up from your usual blue dream. Great hybrid.”"
