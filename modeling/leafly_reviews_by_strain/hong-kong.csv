Williamsson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1351016,"“Hong Kong aka Hong Kong Star a wonderful Hybrid of Sour Diesel x Sensi Star.  Pungent aroma, Skunky to spicy taste. This Sativa-dominant hybrid is a perfect mix for me. After a few rounds smoked in a pipe I was able to get my yardwork done. Then a few bong's latter and I was relaxed sleep will be easy. My supply came from a 100% hydrofarm. I will be getting more!”"

A subtle head high, accompanied by a dramatic reduction in anxiety without feeling cloudy. No couch lock here! I can easily play difficult classical piano pieces, without any confusion. This is great for those suffering from crippling depression or anxiety. It does the job, without feeling "medicated."”"

BJW,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1224195,"“Cool strain; I've had alot of Sour Diesel crosses, but this is a really nice one in terms of a balanced strong high with a good taste.  I'd call it a slightly sativa dominant hybrid; kind of in the realm of a Blue Dream or OG Kush; I assume it's called Hong Kong because of the smell/taste ... like a diesel fuel infused spice/pepper/flowery stink ... all that is missing is the chicken and you have the smell of eating ...”"

AJSAIZ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1062900,"“This strain will certainly get the job done as it pertains to pain and the ability to sleep.”"
imjordynnn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1323832,"“Smells, looks, and tastes dead on what the strain describes. When you buy top shelf weed this is literally one of the bests if you love relaxing and just smoking a bowl and chilling the fuck out. One of my favorites and i am an indica favorite person.”"
failureissuccess,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1062905,"“Taken at the tail end of my day right before hitting the gym. My fatigue melted away and I was left with an abundance of focus and energy. It made me very clear headed and I obtained laser vision over my surroundings. Had a spicy taste, similar to black pepper.”"

koesherbacon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1062894,"“Agree about the muscle spasms.  I found it energized and uplifted my mood which helped me get things done as well.  I think it's a more Sativa-dominant hybrid, with just a perfect amount of Indica in there.”"

FreeGuwop1017,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1369700,"“Wait if Sour Diesel x Sensi Star already makes Death Star then isnt this basically the same strain?”"
Jeffrey_Lebowski,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1176830,"“This is some good shit. The stuff just makes you want to get up and dance around! This strain gives me a huge creativity boost and relaxes my body as well as my mind. I'm going back for more.”"
RustyTrikes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1198494,"“This is my daytime go-to. LOVE the smell and taste. VERY high potency. Energetic, uplifting, focused. Not real"thinky" like some sativa-dom hybrids. Just enough body buzz to get through the day without aches and pains.”"
BennyMM,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1295097,"“Very powerful and hits fast - a strong, mellow, happy high that relaxes you very effectively. Since it's part Diesel, it does have a strong, skunky odor so use discretion on where you use it. I'd say this is a good solo strain to wind down after work with rather than a more giggly, bubbly strain for parties.”"
rockmandolinist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1062899,"“Super frosty buds on this Hong Kong. I get a steady of this because you can roast it skowly like hash and it smokes just like it. Very flavorful taste with a quick launch skywards. 8 and a half at least only because of cottonmouth and harsh cough since this is so much like hash.”"
kot_carson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1062891,"“Tried b/c it seemed similar to Kushage, which was no longer in stock at another local dispensary.  Luckily, it is similar... and better!”"
kot_carson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1062892,"“The more I try this strain, the more I like it.  It really helps my muscle spasms and the painful vice-like compression I always feel due to nerve damage.”"

Rotothebizzel,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1682200,"“I’m currently smoking the Hong Kong. So far I’m feeling pretty good. I got pretty head high after the second hit.  And I’m a pretty constant user, so this shit is strong. Not feeling the munchies so far. That’s new! But feeling relaxed, yet I could go do something fun and feel energetic.”"

dose,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1192535,"“Review based on AMR dispensaries Hong Kong Star in Penrose, CO.
First impressions is the amazing aroma, very exotic. Has an earthy, spicy, sickly sweet diesel smell, with just a hint of grapefruit. Tastes just like it smells, with that trademark diesel aftertaste.  After just a couple of draws from a waterpipe, my nausea was gone(I suffer from chronic nausea and gastric lymphoma, among other maladies).  Now that its...”"

MoBiscuits420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hong-kong/reviews/1504406,"“I think this strain is fantastic but I gave it a 4 out of 5 star rating only because it's just not the right strain for me. If you are looking for something to boost your energy and increase your appetite, then this is a perfect strain for you. If you are sensitive to anxiety or hypoglycemic, I would not recommend this strain.”"
