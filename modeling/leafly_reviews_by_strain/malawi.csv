Malawi

Deetom,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1410904,"“I grew African Buzz (a special selection of Malawi Gold) and all I've got to say is... I really, really, really like this stuff. It grew easily. Had a mildew problem. This plant resisted better than any of the other strains growing. While flowering, the smell wasn't too strong, pretty easy to conceal if you just had one or two growing at home. It smelled like lemon Pledge and Bazooka Joe bubblegum... it's a weird com...”"
DieselDude420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1389512,"“This stuff is excellent and a strong Sativa.   Very wide awake which I love.  I'm always tired.   It made me realize again why Counting Crows is the best band ever.   Very easy to smoke and I did 3-4 hits.  More than enough.  It's strong.”"
jpecks,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1390580,"“A powerful sativa that looks and smells magnificent. The buds are dense and the high is very uplifting. Highly recommended for those who appreciate Durban or Snowcap. A sweet daytime smoke.”"

WeedReports.com,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1395419,"“I love the 100% organic Malawi with a passion! It is very energetic and produces a dreamlike high that leaves you full of energy and in the mood to get out into nature.  I love fishing with this strain. Even after 10 hours of not catching anything, our spirits are still high and so are we!  It has a sweet soft taste that can leave a skunky smell after burned.  The high takes 5-10 minutes to come on, but then it hits ...”"
steve_goa,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1412374,"“I'm smoking generic Malawi Gold (or what is called #1 grade) here in Lilongwe, Malawi. I must say that its better than any other strain I tried in Africa. A powerful lasting high that lasts 4 - 5 hours. Your experience will vary greatly upon your mood at the time of smoking. I recommend being relaxed. 

Procuring: Its not available on the streets, so you have to know someone who will sell you this stuff. Live in Mala...”"
willum070,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1071532,"“I have really enjoyed the Malawi Gold strain. It vaporizes nicely and has a fruity aftertaste. The energetic effects are more pronounced with a bongload, which nicely complemented a couple of hours speeding along the local bike trail. The thing I appreciate most about Malawi is that it doesn't leave me feeling tired as the effects wear off, so it's great for daytime use. It is just a tasty well-rounded bud.”"
Bballspree88,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1283136,"“I saw an episode of Strain Hunters when they went to Africa and found the pure Malawi Gold so when my boy told me he had a Hybridized 70 Malawi gold/ 30 silver haze his buddy just finished curing after a year and a half.. So i bought this surprisingly expensive bud which had that signature sativa stringiness and sweet smell plus the resin production of haze so i knew i was in for a good time.. I made Rosin and BAM ri...”"

Malawi is everything you hope cannabis will be. Music sounds good, food tastes great, your bodily senses come alive and ordinary routines like stretching, massaging your feet and washing your face feel AMAZING. At the same time, your mind sparkles with curiosity and clarity; my first time out I was ...”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1066369,"“Very unique taste when you get one of the long flowering cuts. Reminds me of fresh green olives right off the tree. A very "up", euphoric, creative effect. Nothing beats a pure, landrace Sativa!”"
lowrider,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1319774,"“This is one of the top strains in Southern Africa. Usually found in corn cobs, africans also get the buds directly from Malawi. With it being an old growing region, with growers that take pride in thier product, you can find great produce. However majority arrives with quite a few seeds. But still a good smoke.”"

Herbalmagician,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1363789,"“Review for the strain "Equanimity" (Strawberry Chunk {Strawberry Cough ♀ x Deep Chunk ♂} ♀ x Heirloom Malawi ♂):
I obtained a gram from Farma in Portland, OR. Tested at 29.7% THC. Grown "in house" by Newcleus, using "organic living soil" method. 
I have had my eye on this strain for some time, as I am always eager to try landrace genetics. I expected this to be a sativa dominant strain, however I was surprised to fin...”"
gabrieljmitchell,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1320081,"“When I find a strain like African Buzz (a variant of Malawi Gold) I get very excited. As it is a 100% Sativa strain the body high is lacking and so I do need to smoke more before I begin to really notice the THC activating but the effects are much preferable to an Indica Dominant strain like Northern Lights. African Buzz/Malawi Gold is the perfect strain for daily cannabis use. I like smoking a lot but I’m also a bus...”"
crickersays,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1517187,"“Purchased Golden Malawi from Shore Naturals LLC in Maryland. 

Beautiful, well cured buds. Smokes easy and is delicious. Pretty quick body high, followed by a creeper of an energetic head high. I find I can have great conversations on this strain, and feed off the mounting euphoria of connecting with others while on this bud. Highly recommend for daytime use, or social use.”"
tcdabraider,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1516894,"“Very pleasant taste. Within the first 10-15 minutes, I felt completely relaxed. A few moments after that I felt a sudden sense of euphoria like someone had opened the window and a spring breeze had come through the air. My back went from having achy, sharp pains to being able to simply stand or sit without wincing. My shoulder and knees went from horrible movie excruciating pain to wanting play volleyball (sort of). ...”"
Benwitmer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1518720,"“Excellent Sativa.  A semi-rare strain that hails from the cradle of life: Africa.  Strong, heady high that precedes a nice, energetic body buzz.  High in THC.  I "highly" recommend this strain as a go-to pure sativa strain.  I realize some of these were incomplete sentences; my apologies.”"
C3BHO,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1369986,"“This daytime strain is a great balance of energy and joy. Some of the effects are a bit delayed in onset, but the euphoric feeling isn't one of them. I definitely hope availability won't be a problem in my area.”"

DaraMagUiginn,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/malawi/reviews/1689847,"“Great strain. Bought 10.5 grams not long ago, and I’m still smoking it. As a daytime high, it’s pleasant, almost euphoric. Things definitely looked better to me when I smoked it. I recommend walking around the park while high on Malawi, or sitting on your porch listening to the birds. At night, it’s great for watching trippy stuff. 3 rips in right now. Would recommend to any fan of strong sativas.”"
