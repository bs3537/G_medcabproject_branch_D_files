Helped with my flu symptoms as well! Helps with the headache, body ache and overall bad feeling.

Very smooth, you only cough if you take too much, easier to smoke with the flu then some harsher strains.

Strain: Chocolate Chunk
Indica -- Potency Analysis: TTL 21.5% THC 20.40% CBD 0.27%
-- Cost: $15/gram -- The smell is very pungent.  It's that rich, swampy kind of smell.  It gets deep into your sinuses and dances around back there.  There's a dank, heavy sweetness in the earthiness.

I am a heavy medicinal user with PTSD, insomnia and nerve issues.  This strain IMMEDIATELY put me at ease.  Haven't had a nice one or two hit bud like this in awhile.

I smoke recreationally, but I do have major anxiety issues. Chocolate Chunk dissolves stress. It is a beautiful strain. It's potent so it shouldn't be a bummer for seasoned smokers, and dang is it... smooooothhhh.  It tastes great, it smokes great, and it makes you feel great.

Bred from a select hindu kush from what I have seen in the genetics .The trichomes I got on my batch were beautiful and very plentiful.

I prefer to make edibles out of most indicas as I find that's better on pain, and this one is a doozy.
