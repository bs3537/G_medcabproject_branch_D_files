FractalPhantom,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-og/reviews/1417461,"“Really buzzed, energetic, happy high. Couldn't stop laughing. Made my depression completely vanish for the first time in years. However, it made my anxiety act up and I couldn't stop moving around or twitching.”"

stoney8113,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-og/reviews/1474668,"“I grew this strain both indoor and out, and this is my experience. Growing indoor, it seems my pheno took on more the diesel characteristics. Very dense, sugary buds. Smells like you're typical diesel variety, while the taste was more......minty or fuely kind of. Growing outdoor it was phenominal. For some reason, it kind of purpled up. Very,very dense buds covered in trichomes. You can definitely smell the strawberr...”"

The Bruce Banner lineage is very present, in flavor and looks. The effect is very mellowing and killed my stress levels instantly after a couple hits. Highly recommended!!”"
StrawberryFieldsInAugust,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-og/reviews/1597484,"“My new favorite morning and daytime smoke! Nugs are shaped and look like little strawberries. Aroma is sweet like delicious fresh ripened strawberries. Alert High. Exhilarating uplifting smoke. Eases physical pain, fatigue, nausea and depression. Downside: Dry mouth, dry eyes.”"

All about the taste with this one - super piney with sweet strawberries on the nose and palate. Resinous, heavy on the lungs. Probably a 50/50; heady and stoned.”"

I have Extreme Skelital issues of the spinal cord. from the start of neck bone at the base of the skull and straight to my Ass bone.

jaylbird,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-og/reviews/1539367,"“PROS: 
Very good at relieving pain and stress. No apparent change to blood pressure. If used cautiously, it can be safe for certain types of work, including driving. 

CONS:
It can give a bit of the munchies, but not uncontrollable. It does have a burn-out phase that can be perfect for napping or bedding down for the night.”"

BuffaloSouljah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-og/reviews/1776368,"“Very nice Strawberry smell and taste. reminds me of a blue cheese flavor with strawberry for those that have had it. I've never tried either of the parents for this strain but it is top quality.

For all the anxiety sufferers out there.. Do not worry! Unlike certain  strains make me feel (lookin at you AK-47) this doesn't induce anxiety.

In my town it sits over 30% THC which lets me use small amounts and still get q...”"

nogcalfam,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-og/reviews/1697094,"“Had 3 fem's in an indoor and the yield was approximately 4.5 Oz. undried. Just smoked a blunt of strawberry OG,but i do not recommended it because it changes the flavour of a strain that its known for its fruity aroma and taste. When you light a joint of this strain you will be transported into a fruit salad full of berries and relaxation. The effects are uplifting and the aroma is like an authentic fruit garden!

Well one half ass toke (starting slow because experience has taught me well that too much too fast is NOT a good thing 🤣🤣🤣) had me forgetting my troubles, laughing hard, munching on whatever I had available with dry mouth and lock jaw from hell.

I have anxiety and depression and most strains don't cut it, but after a preroll of this from the dispensary, I'm in love. I'm happy, I'm giggly, I'm carefree, it's the most wonderful I've felt in a long time. I'm definitely gonna be getting this every time I go.”"
