While I wouldn't use before a day of work, it's definitely a high functioning plant. Bring this to a party and have a great time, or smoke a few bowls and netflix it, this plant is versatile everything becomes way cooler.

This strain can send you to a pool of creativity floating around, or simply just a late night out with the homeis. It takes away any anexiety or stress. It’s like the plant just greets you at the current state of mind. It provides a calm and mellow high perfect for day and night alike. Try it if you ever get the chance!
