=============
faebae,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1359510,"“Such a beautiful strain. Very aromatic and has a great fruity flavor to it. Most importantly..took away the stress and anxiety the day brings. Aquired at Green Sky Collective. Top Shelf bud for sure. Especially when rolled up ✌”"
nwlivin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1356441,"“This strain was a slow friendship. It took a few different sessions to really appreciate this one. I have come to love the versatility; it calms stress, makes you feel bubbly, great for sore muscles.  It can get you through the day or be a good accompaniment in your nighttime routine.  So happy I gave this one a try.”"
TDB,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1206937,"“I got a batch grown by SoFresh Farms in Portland, OR and it was stunningly beautiful with all over deep purple hues frosted with trichomes. The aroma was even more beautiful and smelled like lilacs dipped in in sugar, which is also how it tasted. The effects were of a mellow indica quality, certainly not a heavy hitter but wonderful nonetheless. One of my all time favorites!”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1356444,"“Really like this strain, the leafly description is one of the most spot on I've read. Smells exactly like a flower and leads to deep thought and good conversations. For someone with a bit of social anxiety like myself, this a great option. 4.5/5”"
bailey22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1359511,"“😍 it's actually pretty smooth. On the exhale I could actually smell, taste and feel the flower petal! Super smooth. It doesn't leave you super relaxed, just enough where you can get through your day!!”"
MisterMeeseeks,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1370219,"“Super relaxing indica hybrid. Violet Delight has an incredible floral aroma and a nice earthy, almost spicy flavor to it. The body high hit me right away and quickly freed me from the stress of the day. This is a wonderful strain to smoke after a long workday, or to relax on the weekends.”"
jperkovich53,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1356443,"“If you want to focus this is the strain! Haha my husband and I planned a whole Disney trip and a 5 year plan to save up for it! Laughing and planing the whole time! finished the evening off with the munchies pb, cookie butter, waffle cone crackers, yogurt parfait all together! Relaxing euphoric high.”"

kd1969,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1334053,"“This strain is, what I like to call, stabilization.  Wipes out anxiety without wiping you out. its a nice slow decent when you begin to go from the creative aspect to the relaxed and sleepy aspect. Nice ride.”"
Capnduff,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1232390,"“Great flavor nice buds with some purple in it. A flowery taste but not potpourri overwhelming. An up high makes you walk, talk and laugh.”"

shaneybunch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1391241,"“Very nice relaxing strain with a good amount of social giggles. Very tasty and aromatic. Picked a half oz up at the Gorge Greenery in hood river perfect for all these snowy inside days.”"
zelly3rdeye,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1217178,"“Tried this with a 26% thc level in both a bubbler and on a second occasion a joint. Didn't cough once. Pleasantly tingly early on. Relaxing and happy. Not too sleepy but I was tired the first time I tried it and had to take a nap within an hour of smoking. Relaxed and awake the second time. A little bit of the munchies, but not so much that a light snack kept that under control. Enjoyable and easy smoking.”"
nerdybird,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1254291,"“it's been a long time since a strain gave me the giggles like this one did.  fun, social, giggly high, very spacey - and I mean that in a great way!  taste was a little more earthy than most strains I've had, but it smoked smooth and went straight to my head.  we had this one at a party, so I can also say it mixes great with a little wine.”"

ceramicbullet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1483642,"“This is my new favorite strain. I feel motivated, creative, and energetic; literally, I have hopped out of bed because I suddenly needed to create or clean something. I can maintain clear thoughts, and my memory seems to improve. Beat part is, I never feel tired after smoking this strain. I can just work all night, and come down slowly. Only downside is now I feel more paranoid/unstable when I'm not stoned.”"

MrDrSir,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1564378,"“Mysterious, delicious, consciously cultivated by the Artesians over at CascadiaElevatedAgriculture. This spunky little number is Oregon grown and bursting with character. Reminiscent of a late 90's rap video the nug was bling-blinging with trichomes with a terpene profile evocative of Auntie Sadies Sunday perfume. Heavy notes of (less intoxi...enjoyable) purple flowers and filling mouthfeel make this an ideal precurs...”"

evan206,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1232666,"“This dominant indica had me intrigued in the shop. The buds were very tight and dense, and cone shaped. Dark green with orange, it was glittering with trichomes. It had an earthy and potent smell. I smoked it out of a bong, and it was extremely smooth! It was so harsh less that I can honestly say I maybe coughed twice through the whole gram! Great high, no paranoia, just a great body high, with a positive euphoric fe...”"

darkdragon333,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1299598,"“This strain felt a lot weaker than it seems like it should have been. I was a little disappointed. I didn't notice much of a high at all. However, it did make me very talkative, and it tasted pretty good.”"

Smoked in a small water pipe, not too harsh.  smoked 1/3  gram before bed, had to review this first!  This is what I like, a pleasant and calm mindset with a sense of impending amusement about to burst forth.   Next day I added some of the flower to my canna olive oil and cooked breakfast.  "Fried" potatoes pan fried with sauage and an egg.  the potatoes soak up the oils and...”"
NostalgicDreamer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/violet-delight/reviews/1234925,"“A nice consistent high.  Tight buds that can be sliced with an blade.  Perfect one-hit "disks" that burns cleanly.  

I prefer a little looser bud.  To much handling to break up the heart of the bud.

Violet's Delight is also missing on Seedfinder database.”"
