Shonen666,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrus-sap/reviews/1304416,"“This strain as a whole has an amazing smell that has a pungent sour smell, and a sweet enough taste. The hybrid high kicks in strong with a couple of snaps, and gives me an instant sense of calmness with the a heavy feeling in my eyes and upper body. Very nice grow that could have a great yield if grown with sunshine, water and love.”"
jennett2433,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrus-sap/reviews/1318435,"“Tried some this week and OMG...so impressed. Firstly, this bud smells amazing, like you're in a citrus paradise. The smoke is really smooth and tastes great on the exhale. The buds are gorgeous and covered in crystals. The hi is very mindful and relaxing. It lasts around 2 hours and sort of creeps up on you. A must try!”"

This is definitely potent, but didn't leave me drowsy. Actually took an hour-long walk afterwards. Great stuff.”"

Sublime1993,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/citrus-sap/reviews/1427205,"“Very uplifting to get you in a happy mood. Relaxing body buzz, not too much couch locking, and mentally stimulating. Very potent strain best for wake an bake, and daytime use. You can also stay focus and alert on this to get somethings done if you have to. 
Medical uses if most definitely for depression and pain relief. Works well for anxiety use, and the mental stimulation from Citrus Sap isn't overwhelming to make ...”"
