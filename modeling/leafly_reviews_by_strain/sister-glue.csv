I've circled around to this one twice, and it is the best weed I have ever had.  Super strong and awesome.  It gives me everything that I look for in a high- relaxation, uplifted, creative, and focused.  It really feels like the indica body effects with much more stimulation of the mind.  This engages my creativity much more than anything else that I have tried.”"

buddybudbuds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sister-glue/reviews/1259927,"“Love this strain! It's got a very piney smell, mixed with a sweetness, almost floral smells, but not overwhelming, meaning I can keep it in my bag and everyone I pass doesn't know I have bud on me ahaha A great after work, chill out and literally get glued to your couch feeling, felt very relaxed, and peaceful and it helped immensely with my anxiety! Smoke on my friends!🤘🏻✌🏼️”"

The High is Strong but Pleasant and JUST relaxing enough to put you at ease, but not so much that you feel sleepy (feelings and energy levels vary with everyone, naturally). To be sure,  if you come across some, count it ALL JOY, you will NOT be disappointed.”"

The cat noticed the smoke had a sweeter taste and the oil had a heavy syrupy piney and earthy aroma. Not so much pungent. Perhaps, the dog they got it from wasn't correct about the name :( it's more indica dominant and makes my cat nap.
