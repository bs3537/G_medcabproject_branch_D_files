The pressure from my sinusitis went away with the first rip. I’m a nurse and I’m not a fan of medications (big pharm) so when it comes to treatment.. unless absolutely necessary.. I try avoiding taking pills. During the turn of fall and spring are some of the worst times for me, in relation to sinusitis.. and when it hits.. it hits badly. 

I picked up Moondance as an “add on (FTP)”. On first smoke...”"

Usually I’m always feeling fatigue, this strain changed that.! I recommend this strain for the day. Great flavor, very orange hairs. I have rheumatoid arthritis day I was feeling achy today but this strain helped with that. It’s very nice”"

It's a spacey, euphoric, bright, and engaging type of high. Smells like a herby, orange creamsicle. With some tropical and earthiness thrown in there. If you have social anxiety like I do, this works wonders. 

Stay stoned 💚”"
