Grape Inferno
=============
redtide420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-inferno/reviews/1358402,"“These are dense buds covered with an insane amount of trichomes. The nepali og gives a nice hashy flavor and adds a more euphoric, cerebral high than the querkle alone. She is easy to grow and trains well in small spaces.
 Overall, a delicious cross between an og and purps that packs a punch.”"
SoCalGreenLiving,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-inferno/reviews/1383256,"“Super mellow and euphoric with deep thoughs. It can be a heavey hitter couch lock type lay you down to sleep give you dreams kind of high if you smoke enough bowls. The taste on inhale is a grape explosion and on exhale hashey and earthy. One of my all time favorites!”"

HotelCoralEssex,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-inferno/reviews/1383257,"“Definitely a solid indica, but what I love most about it is its taste! I've had a number of "berry" tasting strains, but this one, when packed into a cape or magic flight box, tastes amazing! It's not the strongest strain out there, but it definitely gets the job done.”"

lukebag,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-inferno/reviews/1358404,"“Probably the best strain from TGA. It seems to be a tahoe og crossed to querkle or a grape cross. Nice bit of pine and fuel dominated by grape. I could vape this all day..they use Bodhis NPOG same as in goji so this is more berry style. Could have a little more potency but still impressive compared to much of the other TGA. Cerebral high, decent body effects, no come down”"
MrPhatal,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-inferno/reviews/1371869,"“AWESOME!! All I can say this is the best strain. it really relaxes you. kills the pain and knocks you out!! If you have an opportunity to try this! Do so. You won't regret it.”"

Dustoff8,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-inferno/reviews/1717403,"“Been growing for 3 seasons, very easy, superb tight buds (when cool nights are available) which allows for fab purple highlights and more than awesome flavors. The best part for pro growers is the easy trim even though huge nugs. The   Best of the Best.”"
missbaltimore,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grape-inferno/reviews/1781051,"“Dark green with hints of purple and many orange hairs. Dense buds with a good texture. Hits smooth, without much coughing. It has a fruity aftertaste. I like it but I probably wouldn’t go out of my way to get it again.”"
