My bud (no pun intended) and I rolled two J's, one for each of us. After the third hit I instantly felt insanely relaxed. By the time I finished the joint I was the happiest person there could be.

Gold Coast Premium Nug Run Orange Cookies

I've been able to sample quite a few citrus flavoured strains lately, such as Cali O, Tangie, the parent of this strain, Orange Juice, and Jillybean. If you're in it for the terps, you probably want to stick to something Tangie-related, which produces a much purer orange flavour....”"

It smells like orange peels and smokes great.”"

Well, I was not disappointed at all!  The sativa high crept up on me within 15 minutes of smoking and I felt great. High, senses lit up, and brain and body in a good place.

bourgeois,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-cookies/reviews/1387305,"“Wow... One of the tastiest strains I've ever puffed. Nice smooth smoke with a surprisingly less pu grant smell when burning than I expected. Beautiful look that breaks apart easily. Definitely a head high that relaxes into the neck and shoulder area leaving you tension-free for a few hours. HIGHLY recommend this.”"

The effects are off the charts, that nice cerebral high and uplifting effects combined with a very relaxing body high takes away all stress and depression. I could even study hard while high. Definitely recommend this strain if you haven't tried it already.”"
VetteRunner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-cookies/reviews/1378059,"“So sweet & tasty, it's a perfect strain! Very nice body euphoria is felt, yet with a very clean head. Walking can be a challenge right after you consume, but that quickly fades and you're left comfortably buzzed for 3-4 hours. Promotes a healthy appetite, and while you're eating your mind will be in a creative thought process.

One of the top strains of 16/17.”"

Sedating and invigorating at the same time I would use this strain for sleeplessness and pain, and does allow mental stimulation for creativity for like drawing or writing music. Very unique and well rounded for an afternoon-evening smoke.”"
smokie1oakey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-cookies/reviews/1311757,"“nice strain for when you dont want to be super stoned but want a boost in mood.  slight behind the eyes and spinal humming. havent found it to be as flavorful as the review but tastes good.  i smoke diesels and og lineage a lot so i think they make everything else seem less flavorful in comparison.  not a heavy hitting strain.  happy and mellow but not sleepy. not my go to for pain as it doesn't stay prominent in the...”"
MamaRV,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-cookies/reviews/1347757,"“Woo Hoo! That seems to be the best way to describe this strain.  Effects came on strong, starting with a super-trippy (and tingly!) head high, which moved into a nice body high.  This strain would be great for doing anything fun... Maybe a big party or a concert (Ozzy Osbourne's "Flying High Again" was playing while on this high, very appropriate!) \m/”"
GreyGhostGreenPirate,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-cookies/reviews/1382990,"“The smell and taste of this bud is simply amazing! The sweeties citrus smelling, dense, buds will tickles your nose prior to smoking. The high is great and very relaxing. If you like oranges. . . smoke this!”"

SweetTooth66,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-cookies/reviews/1277427,"“Such an amazing bud that just rips they ur skull. It's has hairy orange, yellowed green buds with huge crystals. Very potent high class bud. It's aroma is a rotten orange peels with an also sweet citrusy smell to it.  One of my buddies said if he had to smoke one bud for the rest of his life it would be Orange Cookies. It rips thru ur skull in a clean way and also leaves you relaxed and feeling nice.”"
Lucmart,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-cookies/reviews/1215963,"“Ive gotten some orange smelling bud from this strain a shop called POG aka peace of green back in the day. so if your into good smelling bud that  smells like orange this is a highly prefered strain.”"

Phishheadpdx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-cookies/reviews/1519587,"“This is the worst combo I ever had I got this from #Attis and it was dry and super harsh . No citrus tastes what do ever avoid at all costs.”"
Loud_Noob,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-cookies/reviews/1699412,"“I am on this strain like none other. the wax from Subx, their bud, their prerolls, all are the tastiest stuff I have tried. Subx also has Orange Poison, OJ Bud x Durban Poison. More sativa dominate than the cookies, but also super tasty, if youre looking for more of a sativa version of this id recommend orange poison.”"
freud4you,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-cookies/reviews/1699028,"“In my "career" so far, this has been the best strain I have tried. It gives me wicked cerebral effects (in particular, introspection and creativity), but also has a noticeable body high that dampens any pain. Very very good strain.”"
SkullyOrganics,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-cookies/reviews/1299970,"“Dense, orange smelling rock hard buds. The scent of this strain is pretty awesome if you're into citrusy fruity strains. The taste on this particular cut was slightly lack luster compared to its aroma. The high comes on strong and the dips into a pretty Stoney, sleepy couch lock. 

Def not my fav, but good bud none the less.”"

There was waves going outwards through my body starting in my heart, my vision was distorted for 45 minutes, I felt like I was going to pass out for the first hour (never actually did).
