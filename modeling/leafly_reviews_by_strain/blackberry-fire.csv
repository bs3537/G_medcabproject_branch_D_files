This strain is magnificent!  I've been a connoisseur for 40 years; and I am in love with this flower.
I am a chronic pain/brain injury/multiple surgery patient and this flower hits a home run for me--
Energetic, focused, no muchies, happy, pain free.”"
LunaSoffio,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-fire/reviews/1627273,"“This strain won an award for a reason. It looks and smells exquisite and the taste is brilliantly sweet.  It is strong in both  head and body and works fantastic for alleviating pain and muscle cramps. I am far from a doctor but with my condition this may be having a very significant  anti inflammatory affect.  I would call it ,  relaxing, as well as pain and stress relieving at the very least.”"

SirInfinite,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry-fire/reviews/1777362,"“I really enjoyed this strain. 
Within a couple smooth hits,
I was as light as a pillow during 
A soft rain in June. 

Relaxing, calming, beautiful high.”"

The high is very relaxing and euphoric.  I am very happy with this strain.  I am glad I grew it.  This one is very hard to find in a dispensary it looks like.  I think more people will be growing this one in the future.”"

If you want social and party weed, this is the best.   It will keep you euphoric and uplifted.

Love Love Love this weed.  Will grow it again.”"
