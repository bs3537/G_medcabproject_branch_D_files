WissVibes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/devil-fruit/reviews/1343637,"“One of my favorite Indica strain! Absolutely amazing taste, sweet and smooth, a real delight to smoke. Effects are first uplifted and relaxing, putting you in a good and thinking mood, helps a lot to relax after a long day of work but still allow to perform choirs instead of getting stuck to the couch. And when the effects wear off, you slowly slip inside your bed and enjoy the indica effects...”"

Such a great feeling of relaxation and tingling in all my joints and forehead.  Great for pain management.  This definitely has potential to be amazing when smoked in larger quantity.
