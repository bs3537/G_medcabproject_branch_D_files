Elvis
=============
GREENgo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elvis/reviews/1395568,"“I think this strain helps me out a lot durring the day. Nighttime I turn to White Widow because it puts me out. I have Leukemia and have a hard time eating and keeping it eaten but Elvis works quite well for that. I grow the WW but pay for the Elvis because my indoor Elvis kicked the bucket. (Elvis has left the crop). Stuff is only $50 for an Oz and well worth every toke!”"
pp2625,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elvis/reviews/1363433,"“I was informed that this strain is grown outdoors...and that was a big reason in choosing it...the buds are dense yet fluffy and the smell is rich and heady...it is a great midday smoke...just getting home after work, school, crazy 5pm traffic stress? this is the strain to try.....”"
greenanne420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elvis/reviews/1349834,"“An energetic blend of AK-47 and Skunk #1, Elvis is inspiring! Initial effect is energetic, yet relieved and at ease. Great for concentration and creativity, and a great morning pain reliever. Depending on how it's grown, it can produce a wonderful taste and smooth smoke.”"
BallardK13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elvis/reviews/1344626,"“This particular strain is appealing to the eye and effective on the high!”"
dphillips427,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elvis/reviews/1357354,"“This strain was truly helpful for my pain. I have 3 degenerative discs in my thoracic spine and fibromyalgia in my back,  neck and shoulders and this took care of it all for hours”"
elefkay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elvis/reviews/1191833,"“If you like to relax like I do after a workout session then this a fine choice. takes the edge off of muscle and joint pain. great head high without feeling too tired.”"
zipf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elvis/reviews/1219097,"“Arrowhead shaped buds.  First vape had a bit of green bell pepper flavor, kind of like a Sauvignon Blanc.  Otherwise piney and menthol.   Head high came on quickly with peppiness and alertness.  Body felt pretty normal and relaxed. Had small amount of anxiety from this strain when out in public when my short term memory got scattered.”"

Puffalo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elvis/reviews/1226139,"“This is one of my favorite hybrid.  Elvis wins your nose and mouth. The smell is refreshing and the smoke is smooth.  The high is cerebral, energetic and refreshing. It is easy to build up tolerance with Elvis because it smells and tastes so good. It's a good strain to get out of the funk or get funk. I recommend switching buds to keep Elvis exciting.”"

MrHerbsMan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elvis/reviews/1194909,"“Was having a few drinks in a bar in southern oregon and I met a guy that kinda sketched me out. Was a bit too proud and loud about his proud of his product to be a professional in my opinion. But I found out that his big words were backed up by a big liftoff! Dude threw me a sample and his number, and to this day I wish I had kept it. I took one hit, and I was greeted with an instant wave of euphoria and a for real, ...”"

Dratic55,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elvis/reviews/1343182,"“I'm really loving this strain as a concentrate! It's flavor is uniquely spicy and sweet with a hint of jalapeños. It doesn't seem to take much to get you an intense high, and the high itself is quite the euphoric rush. I'm even getting these peripheral hallucinations as well as flash backs. This works wonders for pain and gives you a creative spark. Finally, my head is buzzing and my body is relaxed while I'm hit wit...”"
