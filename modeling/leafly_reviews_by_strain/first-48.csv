DonkeyMeat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/first-48/reviews/1540900,"“Over all a very good strain, had the flower. Got it from Urban wellness in Abq NM. At first what caught me was the smell with a sweet yet earthy undertone to a hashy sent was really outstanding. On the first pull (bong hit) i was delighted with the taste better then expected, then can a very calming and relaxing high with what I would consider a clear yet stoney feel. All around a very awesome strain, would defiantly...”"

Ryno602,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/first-48/reviews/1568815,"“I had the pleasure of enjoying a dab from this magical plant. It tastes amazing and has a very calming effect. The "shatter" was more of a butter that wasn't harsh on the throat but hits like a Mike Tyson punch. 🌵”"

The batch I got from Curaleaf measured in at 22.5% THC, so it packed a bit of a punch.”"

medicalmarijuanaguy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/first-48/reviews/1737775,"“Very earthy strain, smell and taste. Smells like freshly cut grass; Smokes really well, not a harsh hitter. Great head high, gives a mellow and relaxed feeling.”"
Cherryskarp,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/first-48/reviews/1738448,"“Trying the 22.5% as well as the 20.0% flower from Curaleaf.  True, not a lot of good flavor, but both  very smooth. Stress is gone, and also the neck stiffness I experience from stenosis.  No couch lock, just more appreciation for the day.  I like it!”"

CaptainRat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/first-48/reviews/1716830,"“Found this at Curaleaf on the Treasure Coast of Florida. At $48.00 an 1/8 oz I think it is a little overpriced but the medical marijuana system will surely balance out prices at some point. Enough comentary let's get to the review. This is a very stony and relaxing high that I found to be very enjoyable. My sense of smell has suffered from a serious sinus infection in 2012 so trying to determine scents and flavors is...”"
Mayahope123,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/first-48/reviews/1718102,"“Good taste, but it’s smells were not strong enough to enjoy.  It’s a relaxing high but doesn’t stupor you or make you foggy headed. I’m tired of having to wait weeks for only one choice of flower in florida. Which dispensary in south Florida has THC flower the most often?”"

googleymoo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/first-48/reviews/1704673,"“Used 30mg oral capsules.  No positive or negative effects noted.  Found it on sale at FL dispensary; now I know why it was on clearance.  Perhaps that was a weak batch, and maybe the flower is great.....but for me, the oral caps were a bummer”"
hybrid_nation,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/first-48/reviews/1697773,"“I really wanted to like this strain, i really did. After reading all the reviews i figured i would place an order with Liberty health in florida. They sell 60x 10mg capsules for $70, trulieve sells 25x 10mg capsules for $60 (no thats not a typo) you can get 35 MORE  10mg capsules from liberty for $10 more so i figured i would give them a try.... I suffer from chronic pain & PTSD so i am always looking for new hybrids...”"
