Bianca

lymanx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bianca/reviews/1411794,"“Smoking my homegrown bud from this hybrid strain. Right off the bat you get an uplifting, creative, buzz thanks to the white widow genetics. I prefer smoking this right before something like playing guitar or writing, rather than before going to bed. The high does turn into a pleasant couch lock eventually. The flavor imo isn't my favorite - it's got an earthy/spice/wood thing happening. Overall I dig it.”"
WorstCaseOntario,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bianca/reviews/1516281,"“this along with a few other strains are the first ones that I grew. out of the 7 strains I grew this is my favorite of the bunch. has a good flavor especially through a vape or water pipe and the high is not overwhelming but still strong. I would definitely grow this strain again and has been my go to strain at the moment.”"

Initial hybrid-like high but quickly turns into a pure indica for me. I wouldn't suggest this one before doing any kind of paper/school work. Great straight for relaxing after a long day. Burns smooth and doesn't taste very harsh.”"

Dxys,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bianca/reviews/1494697,"“Bianca was the first strain I bought from a dispensary. idk why the name just enticed me into buying it. upon further inspection the nugs of the flower itself were dense and covered in Orange pistils. It was a couchlock strain for me. I only smoked this strain at night because it made me tired, but calm. right now I have 3 Bianca demonized seeds in the ground in veg and they look great overall a great experience with...”"
