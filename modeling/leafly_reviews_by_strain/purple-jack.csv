Purple Jack

Mushroombled,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1334894,"“Definite Sativa, Has this amazing fruityiness that is slightly pungent with... well a Jack Herer smell over it, The high is perfect, you are chilled with a head high that is more of a buzz and it kills stress with no ill effects after awhile the indica sets in and you might drop though.”"
Sweetleaf99,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1235419,"“First thing I noticed was a very sweet citrus smell not unlike a tangerine or mango.  The buds had a nice green color with very light coloured hairs.  The buds were not as dense as I have seen in other strains.   I was told this strain has Jack H. and an indica.  The smoke was harsher than I am used to.  I dont use tobacco products so I may be more sensitive.   The effects did creep a bit.  But to me I experienced a ...”"

afera,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1334897,"“The Purple Kush really helps with the anxiety I tend to feel from Sativa dominant strains such as Jack. I get the amazing conversation-stimulating and uplifting effects of the Sativa with the body calming effects of the Indica.”"
Sativastalker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1334895,"“Really couldn't tell if this was sativa or indica.  It felt like both. All I know is it is strong. Almost too much at one point but not quite. A bit of a creeper. Very stoney, could put you to sleep if that is what you want it for. Body and head high. SMMA says it is Sativa dom, the few strain websites that have it say it is 70% indica. Thumbs up. This is powerful medicine.”"
Delight,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1214313,"“This is one of my favorite daytime strains.  I can focus very well and hold an intelligent conversation.  I usually don't like the taste of most strains, but this one is delicious and tangy.  It reminds me of those sweet tarts candies.”"

ishandchips,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1221868,"“This looks and tastes delicious. Relaxing high, feeling grounded yet soaring high.”"
ThisIsMyCake,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1239025,"“Starts with heady sativa effects similar to Jack Herer, and eventually the effects tapper off and you feel relaxed in the body. Overall not a bad strain, taste is superb for vaporization and smoking.

Needs lower tolerance revisit.”"

jaws,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1183168,"“Purple Jack is a well designed hybrid. The Indica and Sativa parents seem to compliment one another with the combined idea of a mind and body high. Tasting of grapes, and an obvious Herer flavor which I describe as dark, smokey, and roasted. Dry mouth side effect is well earned.”"
jayville32,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1223547,"“I find this strain to be outstanding! I have smoked all my life and this is by far one of the best I have ever tried. .on exhale is real hard on lungs if you hit it too hard , but then your freak blowed out your gourd”"
mdm211,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1305245,"“The aroma that first hit my nose was very piney. This is one of my favorite strains because of the uplifting euphoric effects but also brings in the mellow, don't work too hard today effects. Great for anxiety and relaxation.”"
Irobious,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1249263,"“Excellent strain. Crazy pretty to look at, very nice aroma, kind of piney but very sweet. The high is euphoric but calming. It relaxes me without making me feel heavy and it's damn tasty. I didn't really get a harsh smoke though, I did use a water pipe so that may have smoothed out the smoke.”"

Kingtojpisces,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1482239,"“This is one of the first strains I grew. It has extremely dense buds that are completely covered in trichomes. The aroma is pine dominant and a little citrus. Absolutely easy to trim. The sugar leaves actually crunch with every clip of the trimmers.”"
CannabisCrone,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1653980,"“The essence of my favorite hybrid - Saturday morning coffee with “PJ” and the vacuum looks like fun again! The porch floors have been rid of all winter’s debris and now resting comfortably with my second cup-a coffee - feeling HIGHLY accomplished.
Awesome lift with a couple of senior citizen sized hits - and an easy, anxiety free, muscles relaxed morning...”"
Huskies65,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1654499,"“Smoked from a bong using hemp string. Provides a nice steady high that makes we want to be active and makes everything funnier. You can really see the purple in the bud and the smoke is sweet and fruity.”"

FireMarshallBill,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1411768,"“This is an exceptional hybrid that is flying under the radar. In my opinion its more practical than GDP bc of the sativa balance. Yet it maintains the purple hue and crystal aesthetics.”"
VEXXDVIOLETZ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1182522,"“Just smoked this purple jack. I was interested in it because my dispensary listed this as having 25% tch level. I agree with others when they said the smoke was harsh on the exhale. It is very much worth the harsh smoke tho. Feel very high, relaxed, fixated, gazing warmth. It's a winner.”"
bumbleweedz06,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1248159,"“I enjoyed purple jack. It does start of heady, then works its way to the body. Helped with a bit of lower back tension as the full body high took over.”"

payal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1183969,"“Though it is said to be a hybrid, it felt more like a sativa dominant strain. Was pretty pungent and harsh when smoked. I don't usually cough, but this hit my chords.”"
Yasper8,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-jack/reviews/1264482,"“Purple Jack,

 Offers a really nice feeling of euphoria and the occasional buzzing sensation. A little disorientation is to be expected but, not too bad. However, the chills and some dry mouth may cause a few drawbacks... 

My over all the experience of smoking Purple Jack is a good one. 

A 7of10”"
