I enjoyed the balance and energy that The Flav blessed me with. Overall a nice mix for MS'ers who may have creative projects, household chores or social gatherings to attend and need to be energized with a great disposition. Helped bring me out of serious MS blues.”"

So with that being said, I am sure there are many more positives to come in the very near future. This looks to be a moderate yielding plant. Lots of trichomes and they arrived very early. The smell is pine with sage.”"
Williamsson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/the-flav/reviews/1346443,"“Smooth taste, uplifting high not too heavy but also noticeable indica traits. This is a happy medium for me between indica and sativa a "working mans bud", when he or she needs a bit more than a true sativa. I would recommend this strain.”"
