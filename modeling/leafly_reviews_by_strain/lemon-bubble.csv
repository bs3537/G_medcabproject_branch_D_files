WayBells,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-bubble/reviews/1384830,"“Talkative, social, physically relaxed buzz, somewhat focused. Easily fascinated by things on the internet. Non appetite stimulating. Nice and uplifting, without being overpowering. Moderately helpful for intestinal pain/cramping. Definitely will look for in the dispensaries again.”"
KittyPurdyPaws,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-bubble/reviews/1384012,"“Absolutely wonderful, powerfully potent strain. Only a very small amount is needed to feel the immediate, sublime effects that continue to build for the duration (several hours!) It will uplift you from any crappy mood, making it wonderful for depression. Its cerebral & physical effects are very powerful, lots of feeling wavy, tingly and melty. It's incredibly euphoric, and brings on the giggles in a pleasant way. Al...”"

Ammih,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-bubble/reviews/1374961,"“Really nice strain to relax with smoking with friends. Starts off energetic and then goes into a relaxing high. When I hit this with a bong it hit me like a truck and got me instantly stoned. The flavour was a lot of lemon. Very paranoid at times. Wouldn't recommend to a first time smoker.”"

Lemony taste and the buds were quite small. Started out energizing me and then about 30 mins later it turns you into a couch potato. The chair or couch calls your name and you Have to sit!! Lol I would smoke this with a friend or two and enjoy even more by watching a program. Lovely feeling and takes away all my sore muscles. Does gi...”"

I would think most indica specific users would feel dissapointed in the type of high this gives you. didn't make my eyes red but definitely dry. all in all I...”"

TylerKhalil,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-bubble/reviews/1290877,"“This strand is actually good for being what it is :)
It would be bomb as an hybrid 😍, 
- match this with an pineapple or something fruity type of blunt wrap, it gives you that relaxational high that makes you want to Be and talkative person and very social use this at a social gathering especially if you don't know people”"
tchapman04,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-bubble/reviews/1411452,"“Absofuckinglutely amazing strain! I'm such a lover of sativas so this is a real pleaser. Comes on fast and strong, sending you spinning in to a state of euphoria. Its so strong that it took me three goes to get through one joint 😂 fucking love this strain. My advice is get as medicated as possible and sit down to watch Mr. Nice.”"
Sasqwatts,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-bubble/reviews/1232193,"“Had Lemon Skunk the week before i got the lemon bubble in and i gotta say.. this stuff is spectacular. Highly recommended for a chill, low key smoke sesh. Also great sleep aid, but doesn't make you too drowsy. Overall beautiful strand.”"
tb1605,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-bubble/reviews/1233694,"“i hated the taste of it the high was energetic talkative and relieved stress but too much of a sativa not too narcotic”"

surfingramps,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-bubble/reviews/1314888,"“Bingo! 

A bonanza of Lemons wrapped in a tropical wave of papaya and ginger! 

Is this cannabis? or is this some superfood? Wow! Dreamy effects squashing my stress and pain. Crazy cerebral pulses as I switched on and off from fast to slow from go go go to let's find a couch fast. Sativa effects seem to involve a hybrid influence.”"
rayraymanders,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-bubble/reviews/1342859,"“I usually always prefer sativa strains . Lemon Bubble was exactly what I like. Nice body buzz, super chill/happy. It didn't give me paranoia like other users noted in their reviews. I liked that it didn't make me hungry - some sativas I have smoked made me eat everything in sight haha!! If you're a regular smoker like me and prefer sativas, you will like this one .”"

Benw2019,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-bubble/reviews/1791189,"“Good morning smoke or suitable when you need to get stuff done and aren't feeling particularly motivated. Really pronounced flavourful, sweet taste and an even better smell.”"
theplaynicecorp,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-bubble/reviews/1760371,"“To be honest this strain is a bit like a see-saw.  You're way up or you're...not.  When you're up you're too up, totally elevated but very anxious and the high is hard to control to the point where if you smoke too much, you're actually tripping.  I hit too much in a bong once, and everything felt like it was dripping somehow.  I usually drink a beer with my weed, but this time, I just poured the beer down the sink.
