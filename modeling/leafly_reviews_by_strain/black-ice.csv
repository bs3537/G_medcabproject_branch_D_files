Prairie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1410448,"“Strongly Indica-dominant hybrid.  Very sedating.  Not a cerebral high.  Excellent back pain relief and sleep aid!”"
zaierizh,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1388513,"“Black Ice provides a nice relaxing sedative kind of high. Perfect for anyone with insomnia or stress, this strain will definitely put you down. This strain is a definite choice for anyone looking to relax and completely melt into the seat or bed.”"
armstrong423,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1389029,"“Here's the deal, Black Ice is a heady mother F'r. You feel it in your head pretty fast, making you relaxed and a  little heavy headed. As your brain matter thickens and coagulates, you loose most rational thought and worries as your thick head spreads to your shoulders and neck. Within an hour or so the only thing you want is sweet sweet sleep and it doesn't disappoint. Dry ass mouth and some munchies accompany this ...”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1397638,"“This strain is now my favorite.  Very cool dark color buds, sedating effect.”"
marialatina,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1388543,"“I really enjoy the taste. a bit flowery, almost like an herbal tea. A little goes a long way for me, a daily smoker. I feel a nice numbing sensation, a relaxing of my muscles, a very mellow buzz. does make me a bit dry”"

Maybe slightly differnt, Ice-Widow is a IcexWW hybrid.
Look: Extremly dense, lime green buds with thick bright barney purple streaks and fire red hairs, covered with a heavy shell of trichs, rock hard. Beautiful.
Smell/Taste: A rich complex mix of purply berry and sweetness, not distinct but very nice, taste is similar.
Effects: Total relaxation, the first couple hits punch you h...”"
Thegweni,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1388550,"“I found this strain disappointing as a pre bedtime smoke. There was not much of a head effect and the body effects only lasted an hour or so. Judging by other reviews, maybe I had a far too early harvested batch.”"
ChemicalGeorge,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1595035,"“This is a HIGHLY sedative strain. My #1 Indica strain. Puts me to sleep every time.

ahmni,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1388540,"“Potent and relaxing, a nice solid basic indica. Not sure if this characteristic, but my bottle was full of tight tiny buds. Smooth smoke with not much flavor. Moderate relief from pain and inflammation”"

dankguy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1378095,"“This was like getting solidly smashed in the face w a big purple dreamy pillow... it hit hard but felt so good.

Form: crumble
THC: 78%

To this day this strain gives one called F'n Incredible a run for it's money. Black ice is the most sedating indica out there for me, I have yet to find another indica strain that can beat it. 
I have a disgusting tolerance; I go thru a quarter to half gram of wax a day. With this gem I only need 2 dabs to be down & out. Lulled to slee...”"

Regardless if it's crossed with WW or Ice I was not impressed with it.
The buds were nice and dense, and had a nice smell to it (like hay) and the taste was spicy in a way. The high was average to me, nothing about it stood out. It gave a nice body stone that isn't overly heavy and it didn't have much of a head high to talk about. For the avergae smoker I...”"

Sermienterpintor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1077493,"“Smells and tastes very hashy. Helps my headaches, sleep, and apatite. Wish it helped my back, neck, and shoulder pain a bit more but it does help ease the pain. Very relaxing high. Sits me on the couch but doesn't make me feel like I have to stay there. Still able to be very focused and active when needed. Over all a great strain.”"
PSAvet223,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1487192,"“This is one of my new favorite strains. I suffer from sever arthritic pain and this strain has been great for my pain. Also, it brings on some intense relaxation which is great for the muscle spasms. It does make you sleepy, but I've still been able to work just fine on it. All in all, this is a great strain if you just want to relax, chill, and escape from pain for a little bit.”"
aarvid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1411309,"“A powerful and sedative stone. I smoked a 1/2g joint of this and was asleep within an hour. Taste wasn't much, just a little earthy if anything. It was a freebie from a local dispensary. I doubt I'd buy this unless I needed something to put me to sleep.”"
Indica-tion,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-ice/reviews/1320606,"“Not my favorite by any means. Repeated uses have created the same effects; cloudy but pleasant effects mentally. Heavy but not completely draggy in the body. Not enough illuminating effects and not enough physically pleasant effects either.”"

Definitely an Indica. I'm currently stuck in my chair contemplating the feasibility of hover-recliner technology. 
Plenty of cerebral effects to show its Sativa ghost. 
Will try again.”"

I suffer extreme pain from arthritis and fibromyalgia and this is amazing. My whole body is relaxed and tingly like a warm blanket, and it's much stronger than the percocet I took earlier for the pain. I'm not couch locked but I'm very relaxed and (gasp) comfortable even. Everything is just very pleasant and stress free. I'm in love! I'm not able to sleep yet though, so I'm going to inc...”"

The smell and taste is amazing. My favorite tasting strain. It's piney and sweet. A pleasure to taste and smell. 

It's middle of the road as far as potency is concerned. I'm a regular smoker with an average to low tolerance. A bowl before bed is perfect fo...”"

If you like purple shit like me then this bud is as pretty as it gets bc it has not just purple but also black, orange, green, even white hairs in a truly mystical specimen.

I didn't care for the strong peppery taste that burned my throat.  And that probably would have been "doable" except I really didn't get a buzz from this.  Not sure why, but this strain just isn't for me.”"
