MrUnicorn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-mamba/reviews/1418946,"“This strain is an utter Godsend for me.  I am bipolar and there are times when I feel myself slipping into Mania.  Typically I would just have to ride it out and apologize to my wife and friends when the mania ends.  Sometimes it lasts a few hours.  Sometimes a week.  This has ALWAYS been the hardest thing about being bipolar....becoming manic  and losing control and seeing the trail of destruction I leave behind me ...”"

potsnbowls,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-mamba/reviews/1379551,"“First time I've ever smoked something that doesn't make me anti-social. The high is great! I get relaxed, yet I am talkative and social. It is great for insomnia because you are relaxed and it relieves my chronic muscles spasms. It is similar to how you feel when you take an Ativan. Best weed I've ever tried!”"
frankie18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-mamba/reviews/1288682,"“Ive come across two strains called "Black Mamba" or "Kobe Kush". One had fat, puffy, large, speckled-to-completely dark purple nugs, and the other is smaller, golden-tinged, and has specks of black here and there. The black coloration is totally new to me, and dank. 

The larger nug was probably a sativa dom. hybrid.

This review is of the smaller, "Black Mamba" i KNOW is indica through-and-through. First off--sm...”"
PieceFrog,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-mamba/reviews/1092116,"“Can't really explain it, but this strain makes me laugh so hard I'm fearful of having a heart attack!  Certain things become so funny that I simply have to look away or think about something else to get a grip.     Laughing buzz runs off/on for about 1-1.5 hour then mellow followed by a segue to pain-free (solid 8) sleep.  Loopy head high for sure.”"
SanDiegoSteve,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-mamba/reviews/1383262,"“I really love this strain. I can function just fine even though it hits you like a brick. I really enjoy dank, diesel-tasting, heavy-hitting Indica and this really fits the bill. It helps with my anxiety/panic issues and relaxes me for a good night's sleep. In my top 5 for sure.”"

BM I think. Haha BM, like poo. 

I'm 29 and I'm laughing @ the word poo. I think that about sums up the strain.  Not that it's poo, but it makes things like poo super funny. 

I effin love this strain, it's so similar to Black Ice.  Seems to me indica's + Black Domina = super sedating giggly dank. Someone needs to hurry up & create a F'n Incredible & Black Domina ...”"

I felt relaxed and mellowed out. I could feel the muscles 'softening' especially in my neck and shoulders.  I felt like popping in a movie and melting into the couch...

However, it made me too relaxed, mute, and after about an hour, mild couch-lock set in.  The great thing was an absolute lack of paranoia and a willingness to share in the company of others, even though I wasn't at all talkative.”"

mattch,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-mamba/reviews/1342450,"“My favorite for night/bedtime. Perfectly relaxing, doesn't knock me right out, but keeps me asleep when I do inevitably give in. These beautiful, dense, sticky buds are delicious with a sweet aroma...just great.  I like to lay in bed and wind down with some relaxing music with this.”"
BudsyMalone,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-mamba/reviews/1171461,"“This strain was not my one of my favorites which got me pretty bummed since "Kill Bill" is one of my all time favorite films. It wasn't heavy. I barely felt any effects at all. Super clear headed and able to work easily on. That's a good and bad thing to me. If anything, I would say that it was average at best. Not horrible, but, not great either :/”"

The only thing what seemed to be uncorrect in my opinion in Leafly's review was that the flavour was strongly ammonia- like, it tasted nothing like grapes or sweet lollipops, the aroma almost made us not want to smoke the weed, because it smelled strongly like ammonia. Of course this could've been just a sice-effect from...”"
