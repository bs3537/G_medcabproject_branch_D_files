gurren_lynx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mars-og/reviews/1415608,"“Such a fun strain! But don't plan to do anything important on it. Within 10 minutes of smoking this strain i had lost my keys, phone and shoes. It was just a chain of losing things and searching for them. Once I was able to locate everything I settled into a relaxing and cerebral high. Definitely out of this world!”"
OccupyLA,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mars-og/reviews/1415611,"“Name: Mars OG 

From: RE-UP (Dispensary – Garden Grove

Looks: Very big, dense, dark green nugs. High flower to leaf ratio which always makes for good smoke.

Smell: Like a diesel truck farted. Very pungent kush aroma mixed in. Strong stuff for sure.

Taste: Great. Very hashy flavor that makes you cough a bit with every hit.

Buzz Type: This is the kind of high I love. Almost immediately you know you are ba...”"
petyrbaelish,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mars-og/reviews/1415610,"“Mars OG in concentrate form is the most potent, serious indica I have ever tried. If you ever want to understand the true meaning of stoned, pick some up. I found that it relieved anxiety, stress, and sadness, bringing clarity to situations I've been dealing with. Downsides: extreme cotton mouth,”"

You are fixed to one spot with this one and time goes by really slow. I was getting a glass of water and it felt like time stood still and it took forever to fill up my glass full of water.  Note: the effects of this strain lasts a long time. The effects are happy and just all around good feeling. I use this 2 hours before I go t...”"

Every time you take a hit, it's always the same feeling ( first hit of the day) always.. High last for about 2hour strong by the 4th hour it feel very relaxing and you can keep a cool with others. By the 6th hour it's starts to come off (like a sleepy feeling)..

Thanks for reading if you like@ then I will write another..

RickyKasso420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mars-og/reviews/1399092,"“Mars is one of my favorite planetary strains, along with Earth, Jupiter, Pluto, Planetary.....hell, they're all great! Anyway, Mars OG features a potent, fuel-like OG Kush taste and smell that has made it so famous in the last decade. The high is longer lasting than most strains and slightly more intense for that matter.”"
gavin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mars-og/reviews/1352183,"“One of my top favorite heavy do nothing strains. This strain is super sticky, holds its density and doesn't dry out as fast as others, and just does what it is supposed to.

You lose focus on the visual, and relax more in a zone. Its great to just put on music and lounge by yourself. Great stress and pain reliever. 

Don't plan on accomplishing anything besides a good thinking session.”"
prismaticprimate,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mars-og/reviews/1374317,"“This is, without a shadow of a doubt, a quintessential Indica strain. The effects are unmistakably intoxicating but very enjoyable. When I smoked a joint of this delicious strain, I believed everything to be extremely beautiful.  When I say everything, I mean everything. I was watching a random video about Silent Hill 2, and everything that the creators were saying was totally relevant to my life somehow, in some way...”"

I was never a recreational user (I'm 64 now) and the few times I tried it I really hated the "high".  I'm finding I have less problems with anxiety + paranoia if I stick to straight Indica strains.  Mars OG is incredible. It is very soothing, calming, & relaxing with the heavy body high that feels like a bla...”"
