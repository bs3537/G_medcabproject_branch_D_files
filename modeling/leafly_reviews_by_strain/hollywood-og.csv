Lineage: OgreKush x (unknown)

Flavor: Earthy cheese with a pine bitter aftertaste.
Effect: This indica dominate hybrid gives me a head and body high that lets me remain active so I can finish things up at the end of my day. Very positive feeling no stress/anxiety with pain relief and a nice even amount of energy.  The high, the consistency, and the price are great...”"

I have not found a better smelling, tasting, and feeling strain in my entire cannabis consuming career and i am convinced that i never will. My absolute favorite.

Lol perhaps the name caused me to expect a little too much, I wanted to smoke a hollywood blockbuster of epic proportions and instead got something on par w/ reggie.  But please don't take my word for it, its def worth a try as I've been reading other's reviews about this strain.”"
M30Wth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hollywood-og/reviews/1243392,"“Hollywood OG had a powerful effect on me very quickly.  I found myself nodding off to sleep within minutes of smoking.  If I had anything that needed to get done that night it just wouldn't have gotten done.  Definitely not a day-time strain.  For anyone looking for treatment of insomnia however I highly recommend Hollywood OG.”"
