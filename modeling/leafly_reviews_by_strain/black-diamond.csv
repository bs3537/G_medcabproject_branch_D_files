Black Diamond

DionysianMystery,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-diamond/reviews/1391865,"“This is one of my favorite strains still and i get it whenever possible. This strain is one of those magical strains that just seems to cure all ailments without any negative side effects. It also feels the best out of any strain and the high is a real treat. It has an excellent body high similar to that of blackberry kush but its on a whole other level. Its strong but not overwhelming, almost similar to an opiate hi...”"
MrUnicorn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-diamond/reviews/1412062,"“I'm bipolar and this is the best strain I've ever had for relief. 

Here is why: It feels like a cap is put on my head and doesn't allow my thoughts to spin out of control. I took it last night for mania and I finally was able to calm down and relax. It also has a perfect mix of able to move and able to chill. Everything is light and fun. You're clear headed but you will still forget what you went into the kitchen to...”"

calihippie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-diamond/reviews/1373763,"“This strain has a delightful rich mango and berry smell, candy taste with nutty after-tones. Heavy couchlock and intense muscle relaxation. Surprisingly functional for an indica and helps  with focus, making it a good daytime strain. Colors stand out,  food tastes really good, and your friends suddenly become funny. Definitely one of my favorite strains.”"

CannaCure420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-diamond/reviews/1380566,"“This strain is 100% indica, grown to perfection, buds are purple and completely covered in trichomes, has a very unique aroma and flavor, truly hard to describe. Black Diamond Kush is the perfect night time indica to alleviate Gas Pain and increase appetite. Also provides a very relaxing, chill, mellow high. This one causes the couch lock effect, very euphoric and cerebral for an indica :)”"

I love Indica and tend to stay away from Sativa and energetic, but this stuff reminded me of phantom cookies which worked out real well for me. 

Took it with me to play some pokemon go in the park with some friends. No back pain, fairly interactive, all in all really enjoyed it.

At first glance this bud looks dark, but if you look at it under a light it sparkles giving off a purple hue.   The bud broke up beautifully, and smelled
musky and earthy with a sweet, earthy flavour.   This strain relaxed my whole body, silenced my ever moving mind,  and helped me get ready for sleep. It also assisted with pain relie...”"

After two hits off my pipe, I started watching Portlandia. Half hour goes by and I realized the strain could not make that program funny to me.

Beautiful high. Opiate-like. Def a Sunday afternoon smoke. Wouldn’t recommend as a W&B or casual blaze. This shit is strong. Amazing smell and taste. Diesel, earthy, dark and rich smell I’ve come to enjoy. Unlike anything I’ve ever had.

potprincess2000,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-diamond/reviews/1363037,"“Very similar to Black Domina, Black Diamond is a divine strain. Although it's an indica, this plant gives a very focused functional high. Intense muscle relaxation with a heavy couchlock in higher doses. The world becomes funnier, food tastes better, and colors have never been richer.

If I could only use one word to describe how you feel after use; "Contentment".  It has a very relaxed, chill & happy vibe going on.  This strain has the familiar dark earthy and musky aroma & flavor found in only the most potent Indicas.  Black Diamond provides a surprisingly clear headed high that allows you to focus easily on any mental task.  It d...”"

I’m a heavy stoner so I really don’t feel a ton of difference between most strains and I don’t get ‘high’ I just get relaxed or hungry or anxiety free if it’s working :) this is a nice heavy indica, it tastes good with a smooth smoke. Makes you sleepy and hungry and happy!”"
