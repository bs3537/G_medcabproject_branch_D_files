Sojay Haze

TalibDwelli,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1391735,"“Cresco did it again with this cross - OMG.  Sojay Haze reminds me of opening up a really nice bottle of Pinot Noir - awesome fruity undertones with a dash of floral earthiness.  Medium-bodied, of course.  Seriously though, this strain has great mid-density buds that really glisten in the light with frost.  The smoke provides and brilliant uplifting and energetic high with a good amount of headiness/euphoria.  Perfect...”"

chitowndabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1393384,"“The sweet smell of these buds is FANTASTIC! This was a perfect mid-afternoon strain that helped me to refocus and really put me in a creative, uplifting mood.    Didn't have any onset of anxiousness, just a wonderful, focused train of thought. Great happy feeling that accompanies.”"
ChiTownConnoisseur,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1341942,"“Just picked up some nugs of this strain and I'm blown away. The experience is great, hazey/distracting but not racey. This strain really shines with it's smell/flavor. So strong, sweet and floral. A true toker's delight.”"
cubbygreen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1370559,"“I love this strain when I need to be active and focused. It keeps me relaxed, but still on point when there are tasks I need to get done. It makes me chatty, and I feel a lot more relaxed on in social situations.”"
ButtereeBunnee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1626442,"“Sojay was a good purchase.  Strong,mellow high.  Great for after work.  So my beautiful wife spent the day today home alone with Sojay.  She was really giggly all evening.  I think we will buy it again.  Her review of this stain was that it put her in a good head- space but a bit hungry.  It started out as a few quesadillas but before we knew it, the whole chihuahua cheese block was gone...

Beware the soajy - makes ...”"

I wanted to take a minute and update my review of SJH from CY in Butler, PA. After vaping this strain for the past week or so, I've come to appreciate its effects a little more. (Remember from my last review I've never had to toss out because they expired.) Basically what changed my mind is that I started consuming a smaller dose of this st...”"
CannabisKonnoisseur,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1395644,"“Live resin review: Great day time high. No anxiety (for myself and friend), but increased attention and appetite. Energetic for a dab that does not leave your heart racing. Relaxing. I would use this in the future for social settings or creative purposes.”"
DinnerMammal,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1624250,"“I was a little hesitant to explore the appetite arousing effects of Sojay Haze, but if I didn't chew my hand off then neither will you.  Call it an anomaly but I don't get the munchies, however,  if there is good food available I will graze.  Because that is how the Dinner Mammal do. A precarious species,  the Dinner Mammal would much rather pair good herb with good drink and bad bitches. Sojay Haze may be getting a ...”"

Light orange hairs and fluffy buds with a respectable amount of trichomes. The gram I bought was two large buds. I am not too fond of the smell but the effects are definitely noticeable and do linger for awhile afterwards. My nose wasn't getting any citrus or floral scent that others report but rather a strong menthol pine tree and spice smell. Almost remin...”"
Monaliza,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1802535,"“Sojay Haze, Sativa by Cresco in LLR cart. 71.3 % THC and CBG. Relaxing, euphoric and creative are the staples of this string but calm- inducing Sativa. Spicy green beans and sweet peppers, picked fresh are the most unique and delicious flavors in Sojay Haze. Boasting such terps as Terpinolene, Myrcene and Caryophyllene this crackerjack sativa keeps it cool while keeping you going.”"

Cmw53,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1735490,"“Sojay Haze smells and tastes absolutely delicious. This strain gives me a functioning head high and does not give me the temptation to overindulge in munchies. It is also great for physical activity but the slight dry mouth makes it difficult to run.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1724614,"“A solid 5 star wax. The taste alone is amazing. I scored a gram of badder by Cresco. It's a very noticeable high/buzz/feeling. Great euphoria while it combats any depression or emotional distress. 
This has to be one of the best sativas I have had in years. I just zoned out for an hour watching TV mid review, and it's still as strong as when it first kicked in.”"

cannapeace,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1586515,"“I feel as if I should start off this review with a bit of an admission about my cannabis preferences. I very rarely find a strain of Cannabis that I don't like, in fact, I can't think of a single strain I've ever "thrown away", so I must have liked them all well enough. That being said, Sojay Haze was a good, but not great sativa. I purchased a gram of live budder from CY+ in Butler, PA. Given the option, I would pre...”"
koorocker,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1722719,"“I didn’t expect this Sativa to feel so heavy. It takes a little bit to set in and then smacks you like a train! I would say it has deep physical effects as well as uplifting effects. You won’t have a problem falling asleep if you use it at night. If you like this strain, then try Chocolope next!!”"
dadeluna,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1536048,"“Beautiful buds with lots of frost and orange hairs. Pleasant aroma and fluffy when grinded. The onset was fairly rapid and the effects for me where increased physical activity, euphoria, talkative, and overall happiness. Picked this up on sale this week and would recommend for anyone who suffers from depression or lack of energy. I can say that I didn’t notice how much my mind wanted to get accomplished before I was ...”"

This is a great strain for getting things done or getting through things or talking with people it’s a very very good motivator without causing anxiety. Makes things a bit funny !”"
chicagopatient,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1370699,"“Cresco labs flower is fragrant and delicious with minimal odor when vaped. This is an excellent strain for up-lifting euphoria, and it is a good choice for morning medication.”"

Mr.Smoke-a-lot-a-pot,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1799084,"“Great for stimulating appetite without feeling stoned. Great for focus as well. Not a "fun" high but for medical purposes its great. Taste and smell is kind of weird in my opinion.”"

TheBlackYellow,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sojay-haze/reviews/1667308,"“What a perfect carpet ride robust with creativity.  Taken in moderation,  this strain stand out as clearly focused on tasks at hand and sleep nowhere in sight.  Exactly what I seek in a strain.

You clearly feel the effects of this Sativa, which, truth be told, is the polar opposite of the Indica high; couch lock, sleepy and paranoid out the whazoo.

If you take too much as a newbie, you could be in trouble for sure ...”"
