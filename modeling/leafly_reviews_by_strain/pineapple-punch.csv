Cheesy_Bastard,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-punch/reviews/1255986,"“I bought a gram of this in shatter form during a visit to Seattle from a rec club named American Mary.  The label read it tested in at Decarb THC 76.8%, and 0.3%CBD.  It ran my ass over!  And I loved every second of it!!  I was really high, but still very coherent and in control.  Great for people who suffer from Anxiety, Foul Moods, & Short Fuses.  I would definitely buy at every chance I get!”"

So for me to decide to try medication during the day was something new for me. I looked around the sight for the medicine I was looking for. I thought I found it in Pineapple Punch. So I tried it... I grabbed an 8th from my dispensary. Took it home. Started to try to break the buds from the limbs of the stem ...”"

stoneryver,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-punch/reviews/1663687,"“Ohana Gardens 

Pineapple Punch is a new favorite. I grabbed a 1g pre-roll, which was well crafted. Smoked beautifully - very little babysitting needed. By the end of the joint thick resin could be seen seeping through the paper.

Before I finished smoking it, I could clearly feel the cerebral effects kicking in. Fifteen minutes later, I'm felt clear-headed and could feel the body effects kicking in. A half-hour late...”"
