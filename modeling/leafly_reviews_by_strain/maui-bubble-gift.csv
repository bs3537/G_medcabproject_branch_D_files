Onius,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1377389,"“12.4% CBD 8% THC. Maui Bubble Gift (Maui Wowie x BubbleGum x God's Gift x Unknown). Currently, there is one grower in Oregon who is providing this high CBD strain to a couple dispensaries. I'm trying to make sure he/she shares this cutting so the cannabis community doesn't lose it. Any strain with a combined cannabinoid content over 20% is good medicine. When you have a 3:2 ratio of CBD to THC that just sweetens the ...”"
madcapcat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1381152,"“Doesn't get much better than this. This is pretty much the only strain I will buy now because it's so perfect. Very cheerful high, and great for people with a ton of anxiety like me.”"
chetrog,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1381153,"“I am a new smoker, and bought some of this strain. I love this strain for a new smoker. If I smoke a little to much and I get to high It gets me medicated, but I'm not freaking out like some of the other strains I have smoked.”"
Furl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1380349,"“This is a really good medicinal day time weed that allows you to feel the medical benefits of the marijuana and not a complete over powerful high that you don't need in the daylight time. o enjoy being able to take long walks post-tokes of this strain, it helps both my tremors and ADHD as well as makes everything a little bit more delightful. Definitely one of my favorite day strains, and highly recommend if you want...”"
MariahMae,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1380350,"“This does wonderful things for my anxiety and mood. Maui Bubble Gift gives me a calm stress-free happy-go-lucky feeling.  It also is great for back pain and headaches. I recommend it to those sensitive to THC, as the CBD helps ease those negatives.”"
bCurious,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1296588,"“Subtle yet effective. It smells good, tastes good, and feels good. This is a wonderful strain that makes me feel relaxed without knocking me out. The near balance of THC and CBD bring out the best of both.  If you're looking for mild euphoric bliss coupled with nice body benefits (e.g. relaxation, pain reduction,...), without overpowering effects, give Maui Bubble Gift a go. By the way, the lab results for the 'batch...”"

AcaciaWildwood,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1231846,"“I'm gently educated on the finesse of strains and hybrids, but do know when the gentleman at Nectar PDX on Sandy Blvd. recommended this one after patiently listening to me give a summary of what I was hoping to find - a relaxing pain reliever to help me sleep at night while not interfering with my thought processes during the day - he hit it spot on with Maui Bubble Gift. Easily the best experience I've ever had and ...”"
LRM,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1228058,"“Maui Bubble Gift is a great strain with 14.9%CBD and 9.0%THC .  I use it for pain and it was great.  I have a low THC tolerance and it relieved the pain yet it is low enough in THC that I can use it and still function very well.”"

OCHObabies,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1245236,"“This strain hits me hard with a great relaxing body high. While at the same time I have a slight head high as well. I don't feel stuck to the couch or anything bad. Has kind of a wood taste to it. It's great for chilling at home I would buy again”"
SunshineGurl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1387705,"“This is one of my favorite cbd strains. Cannatonic is another. This was my very first purchase & I loved it from the word go. It gives you that happy, everything is comfy, everything is peachy feeling. In higher doses it'll knock you out, at least it does me. But for me, that's partly what I'm looking for”"
sweetbutter80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1214494,"“This strain & the dispensary are top notch! Been having a lot of nausea issues since I had pneumonia this month. Head was just starting to hurt; I wasn't going to let it get worse. Medicated round 1900 or so. Couldn't taste much since I was smoking & not vaping. Takes less than 5 min to start working. Keeps coming for the next half hour or so. I was definitely relaxed & happy. Body high perfect! Pain & nausea gone wi...”"

The buds are thick and dense with orange hairs and have a kind of foul orangy smell but remains pleasing to the senses.  The taste is not all that pleasant.  I would compare it to hay.  Upon smoking it, the first thing i noticed was immediate symptom relief and an uplifting euphoria.   I would highly recomend this strain to a first timer...”"

Nausea much better. Went to a party where I enjoyed myself with friends. Head high mellow & nice, perfect for daytime use. NO ANXIETY/PARANOIA (a must). Body high all but perfect. Something up with my sense of taste. Highly recommend for daytime use! :-)”"
zelly3rdeye,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1261027,"“Easy to smoke and a light odor that didn't linger too long after smoking  I felt a light buzz after a few tokes. Relaxed and no anxiety. Went about my business. Not motivating or energetic but won't impede your regular focus either.  A good choice for daytime or a low key evening smoke to lessen your aches and pains but when you don't want to completely float away.”"
alicemerry,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1193346,"“I've tried many of the high-CBD strains, but this one works much better for me than the others. I often wake up with nerve and muscle pain, and Maui Bubble Gift helps the pain and puts me back to sleep, but doesn't leave me foggy in the morning. It can be hard to find, but for me, it's worth going out of my way for.  It does need a better name.”"

plackblastic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1245489,"“This is it. The sweet spot for me. Nice, mildly energizing buzz that turns my thoughts in a positive direction, but not overstimulating. Mild body high, but not stoning. Good for use n the AM. Few lingering effects or cobwebs. Close to 1:1 ratio. I've tried others with similar numbers, but there's something different about this one.”"
buckz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1189252,"“A very smooth smoke like smoking from a water pipe. Not expanding and has a pleasant taste.

pezpdx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-bubble-gift/reviews/1207886,"“It gave me anxiety for the first 45 mins but took away my cramps, after about 45 mins I became relaxed, giggly and hungry. Sadly my pain wasn't gone long. So far this is my favorite cbd strain, the anxiety was probably a result of smoking more than I'm use to.”"
