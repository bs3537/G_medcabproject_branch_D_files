About 10 minutes later I got really hungry and went downstairs and made some beer cheese popcorn and ate a whole bowl full. Then I waited like an hour and vaped some more and I was starving so I went down and ate 400 calories worth of hummus, a bunch of cheddar cheese, some prosciutto, an apple, and then I decided to eat bunch ...”"

The couch lock effect kicks in immediately and again about a half hour later. A hint of chocolate rolls through your mouth as you draw in the sweet smoke with a berry after taste. This is an excellent choice for someone struggling with insomnia, nausea, anxiety, etc. in my opinion.”"

VERY unique smell and flavor, and kind of a hard strain to come across. Has a sweet smell on the coffeeish/tobacco/earthy side of things. Taste is somewhat fruity with light notes of chocolate and nutty undertones. 

Heady, stoney, smiley stuff here.

And like I said, this strain can be difficult to find, so if ya see it, GRAB SOM...”"

It could also probably be used to help you fall asleep.”"

Method of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer. 

Pros: Strong pain relief and euphoric head high. More hybrid than straight indica. Good if you need to eat, made me quite hungry. 

Cons: Dry eyes and some dry mouth. Little groggy after waking up, still felt some of the head effects.

Overall/Other: Smooth draw and exhale. Taste was sweet/earthy. I could tas...”"

It was the first time a strain actively numbed my pain. Though only the mild ones, it did nothing for the higher pain headaches.

It's a wonderful little bud covered in trichomes and it's always fluffy. I was attracted to it initially by look alone. It's definitely a pretty bud.”"

Masterpiecelost,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chocolate-hashberry/reviews/1388782,"“Really heady. Has a great, mild flavor when herb vaped. Doesn't knock you out, but definitely has a cerebral effect. Great for creativity and visual imagery, but I did also feel couch locked for a time, so that made it harder to do anything with it.
