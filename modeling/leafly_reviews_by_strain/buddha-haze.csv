Samy420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/buddha-haze/reviews/1331328,"“probably the best strain I ever smoked.
I bought some buddha haze at the rotterdammertje in Doetinchem, Netherlands. The smell is fruity and it looks pretty light green with sparkling resin. Although I smoked much tastier strains, the taste was pretty good. The effects blew me away! Very intense sativa, uplifting, happiness and a lot of laughter.”"
StripperBill,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/buddha-haze/reviews/1360859,"“Pretty good strain. Not necessarily what I was after. Good to get you stoned, but not a good strain for anxiety. I'd say it's a pretty damn good before school strain though.”"

I didn't have any pieces at the time so i used an apple which on some occasions will get anyone ripped asf. Well i smoked about .4 of this strain in one sitting because the lighter i had wasnt working which was fine beause i was ripped after that thing kicked in. I had a euphoric high and it was freezing cold outside so i also could barely feel myself. I reccomend th...”"

Doesn't matter what I'm doing I feel happy and I have a little bit of energy I get the fun giggles and the long conversations that are meaningful.  I love this strain it's amazing Buddha Haze all the way!”"
pluran,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/buddha-haze/reviews/1307003,"“From a vape-pen at 65% THC: Deep, smooth, substantial with vague, 'hazy' sativa effects. Mildly uplifting. Ends up relaxing mind and body significantly but can feel like an introspective downer if you're not in a great mood to begin with; and might take a couple of hours to regain some clarity and direction. Kind of a confusing composition, but might also help to trigger and break through some stuff and see things mo...”"

TheDoubleJ,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/buddha-haze/reviews/1288631,"“This is a strain which I've seen before, but now I'm wondering why I've never picked it up. The colour is a nice and healthy green. The smell is just straight up amazing, very fruity and fresh. But it gets even better when you taste it. Sweet, fruity and fresh are the three best words for it, just like the smell. The effect come rolling in decently fast but in the end it will still surprise you. Very strong sativa ef...”"

Eric420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/buddha-haze/reviews/1161821,"“Buddha Haze 

Sativa 85 / Indica 15 Real Euphoric smoke really heady at first but then a little bit of indica starts to kick in 30 mins later ull be tired as hell your eye lids will feel like they weigh 100 pounds, 

Really good strain would for sure pick some up again. clone related to three great hazes: Super Silver Haze, Amnesia Haze, and G-13 Haze. and Big Buddha.”"
