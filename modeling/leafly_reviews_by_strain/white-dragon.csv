This batch was in particular a purely indica strain and man does it do its job! Anxiety by about 2 pm gone and so is my paranoia from the ptsd, overall excellent experience highly recommend for those medical users looking for a good one hitter quitter indica that won't put ...”"

Dano91,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-dragon/reviews/1240650,"“I give this strain a 4 out of 5, I've had this smoke for going on around 3 months. When I mix the pot ha "pot" with other strains of Marijuana I've found coming back to the White Dragon the high  becomes more vivid and intense. This strain in regards to it's parent counterpart as an indica, provides full relief one would expect from an indica. I've found for ME, helps with SLEEP, APPETITE, ANXIETY, RELAXATION, DEPRES...”"

While the couch lock is not perhaps everyone’s favourite cup of mud this strain has surprised an often jaded cannabis market within the Province I do truly feel that this strain should have a home in everyone’s alternative pharmacy cabinet along wi...”"
Beelzebub,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-dragon/reviews/1213880,"“Picked this up about a day ago very chunky buds, awesome kush smell just like its parent linage very very sticky and so many trichomes, think old school white widow on steroids. Will post later on with the actual effects of the strain”"

sgnulmuuca\/,https://www.leafly.com/indica/white-dragon/reviews/1603685,"“Amazing night time strain. Pain leaves your body and a nice tingle in the areas that usually cause pain. Hard to stay focused on the movie I'm watching but when I do I get a sudden rush of more high. Then my eyes focus back. Definitely not an optimal daytime strain as I had to fight the high to stay awake.”"
