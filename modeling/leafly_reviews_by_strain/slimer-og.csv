Donald420Trump,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/slimer-og/reviews/1653780,"“I don't know if its the same but the "slimer og" I had was spelled slymer... it was a pure sativa high.. it was a heavy head high with super dry eyes and cotton mouth... it was a fun & giggle high... it knocked my headache right out... if you are someone who suffers from anxiety or panic attacks I would probably stay away from this one, it gave me a little anxiety but not to bad... it wasn't a energetic sativa, more ...”"

I’ve literally been trying to get a hold of this from them for so long and I’m so excited I have heard that this is the PTSD medicine so without further ado let me take my first dab of the day and let’s take a look at this amazing beautiful live resin sauce from Moxie. Ghost OG and White fire alien come together to create this amazing medicine.

herbdonuts,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/slimer-og/reviews/1392769,"“By far my favorite strain for a good end of day unwind. Hits you hard, as you can tell while you sluggishly make your way to wherever you decide to park yourself for the next couple hours. This strain feels like being cuddled with by a dozen dogs. We're talking cozy.”"

rugger1969,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/slimer-og/reviews/1346171,"“Covered in a white frost with a slight earthy scent. Smooth on the inhale, satisfying on the exhale. Took several minutes to start feeling anything. Slowly eyes start to droop and head high hits. A light feeling with energy and emotions of love and kindness. Excellent euphoric head rush.”"

enchan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/slimer-og/reviews/1474784,"“My boyfriend and I picked up some Slimer OG live resin. Sometimes smoking makes me feel dumb (high), but this stuff makes me feel coherent and content. Very relaxing comforting stuff. My boyfriend definitely felt the dry eyes, other than that I feel like it's a very balanced hybrid.”"

TheFlintstoners,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/slimer-og/reviews/1551696,"“We are a fan of this strain. One of the Flintstoners, a frequent user, was incredibly baked after consuming only one bowl of this strain. The effect was fairly goofy   at first followed by a very relaxed and calming high.

Bambi710,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/slimer-og/reviews/1283163,"“Very well grown. 23% by Boring Weed Co.
very indica, taste is pungent, earthy, outdoorsy smell to the herb, covered in frost. the smoke has a slight spice or bite to it. very relaxing effect.”"
mimigro,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/slimer-og/reviews/1748767,"“I have the concentrate, and the flavor is really nice and helps with my jaw clenching. I feel relaxed like an indica, but not fatigued. Increased curiosity and creativity. Definitely would recommend for wanting to relax while still doing some calm and creative activity 👌🏻”"
PrimalJunkie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/slimer-og/reviews/1805785,"“Hands down my go to for a good day! It helps with migraines or body aches brought on by endometriosis or my fibromyalgia but doesn’t make my anxiety go up at all. If I smoke a little and need to get stuff done I can and if I want to just chill and be pain free I can do that as well!!”"
