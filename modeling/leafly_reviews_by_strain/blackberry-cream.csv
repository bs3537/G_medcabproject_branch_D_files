=============
xillbalba,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1411137,"“Read about this strain on Leafly and a week later it's on the menu of my medical marijuana delivery service here in Las Vegas. Distinct Blackberry taste and a sweet earthy cream like finish. It comes on slow and hits hard. Pain and depression fade fast leaving you happy and after awhile you sleep like prince Valium.
My son and I fell in love with this strain. Wow am I glad I tried this one. Normally I don't like indi...”"

This will have you very lazy and locked on the couch but still feeling social. This strain helped me a lot with anxiety and didn't have me feeling paranoid at all. Perfect for seasoned smokers ready to take on a next level high.”"
Sondoor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1390761,"“Went to my local rec shop and picked this up, the guy at the counter told me its a very heavy indica that will put you in the dirt lol and is best smoked if you have a tolerance built up so you can handle the effects better.  So far i can tell he was not lying at ALL. Mine only comes in at 23% THC but it is a total Creeper, on my first hit i was like i dont feel anything then 2 mins later i was Zonked heavy limbs eve...”"
Jellybean213,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1618251,"“My all-time fave is Blackberry Kush so when I saw this at the shop and noticed the Cookies & Cream cross I had to give it a shot: fucking wow. Vaping this is amazing... you can taste the blackberry on the inhale and a subtle note of cream with the exhale. It's Aces in my book! I've got muscular dystrophy and there's not a day I'm not in pain. This one knocks it down from a 20 to a two. I wouldn't suggest this for nov...”"
cmwollman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1317831,"“wow, such a delicious tasting and smelling strain. Packs a kick, and it's a nice slow-mo, relaxing high. I'm feeling happy, chill, and easily aroused. 😍”"
SunshineGurl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1493723,"“Made me really really happy & relaxed but not couchlocked. Love it❤️ never had the cookies & cream strain before but blackberry kush is one of my all time favs & it feels a lot like that except that I don't feel like going to sleep, more like winding down with a hot drink & a movie. Smells & tastes amazing too :)”"
rickles6,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1420897,"“This strain has two of my favorites crossed together with Blackberry Kush and Cookies & Cream. Boy did it deliver! It was grown by Pilot Farms, and at 22.6% THC. It had a really nice flavor with a pronounced blackberry followed by a light vanilla creaminess. At first I just had a euphoric, happy head high, and then a very strong body crept up on me. I couldn't feel my body, and I was looking at everything like it wa...”"
Kaybae420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1725613,"“First time trying this strain and I’m in love with it. I was worried that it cause me to get paranoid but it didn’t!! It has a bit of a head high that calms your mind and a amazing body high that completely relaxes your body and didn’t cause me any anxiety. Definitely one of my new favourites”"
dr_kymberlee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1655274,"“Winberry makes the BEST Bcm I have ever tasted. It is the perfect relaxant for me. I love the flavor and smell. If I could only have one strain for the rest of my life, this would be it!”"
ElevateYourConciousness,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1357005,"“Incredible. Smoked two joints and listened to A Love Supreme by Coletrane, it was a truly spiritual experience. This is the kinda herb where you have a few hits and you can't stop smiling for the rest of the day. Totally cured my anxiety.”"
kiracanna,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1540034,"“Picked up a batch testing in at 24% THC content, and have since smoked many bowls and a wonderful joint of this stuff. Blackberry Cream takes a bit of time to kick in fully (20-45 minutes on average), so be careful to not oversmoke or you will surely find yourself couchlocked and sleepy. The blackberry flavor can only be masked by the creamy taste in the exhale. The nugs are also decently sized and dense, with beauti...”"
WashingtonGreenery23,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1329470,"“Great taste and smell. The high comes on fast and strong but doesn't last very long. That's the only reason this got 4 stars. Super Stoney but left wondering why I need to smoke more after it suddenly wore off. This is my second night hitting this bud and it happened both times. You do feel relaxed after that. However I smoked it fast because the high from the start was amazing. Still worth a try!”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1722378,"“In Seattle, I’ve tried BC by 2 different growers. Top shelf and hydro empire. Top shelf’s on point. A lot of trich over mostly purple and few spots of green on big fat bushy nugs. Stinky hash berries and cream in aroma and taste. Long brown sprawling hairs all over. Sugar leafs are pretty big and numerous. Smoke is smooth and tasty with a brief decent cough. Effects are relaxed, happy, sedated, zoned, and munchies. I...”"
jjgarton,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1552177,"“Smooth & relaxing... perfect for a Wake & Bake or a late night smoke right before your head hits the pillow. Did I mention is smells AMAZING?”"
QuinGold,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1574310,"“I bought thIs flower in Portland, The nuggs were  fluffy with some purple leaves and granular sugary trichomes all over the place. I love how this shop puts little boveda packs in their flower product,so it’s moist and healthy. Smells great with a mellow and clear headed high for me.I can Netflix and chill or actually get something done, depending on how much I vape. I could easily watch a movie and actually pay atte...”"
BigDan47,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1644592,"“Holy Moly!  It REALLY tastes like berries.  It comes on slow with a body relaxing high.  It is like a comforting hug from a giant teddy bear.  Then comes the head high.  There is nothing I can share to prepare you for what this strain brings to the table.  A discussion on soap molds that are shaped like food, resulted in a midnight text about penis shaped soaps and real world hygienic uses.  Tonight I hide the phone ...”"
thrasherskate,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1697007,"“Ah yes. Blackberry Cream. 

Tonight is my first time trying this strain, (picking up a quad from the dispo) and I have a few things I would like to say. 

The minute my buddy opened up the bag, the room reeked. It reeked real good. 

This high is honestly one of the best I have ever experienced. I am extremely relaxed while at the same time feeling very social. Loading another bowl could possibly put me to sleep. 

T...”"
cookestir,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1520473,"“Picked up this strain in the form of sauce from raw garden here in California. As one of their limited time runs I had high expectations and this strain still blew me away. Excellent flavor and excellent effects. Really helped me relax while not feeling paranoid. Would recommend to anyone who suffers from chronic pain or anxiety.”"

Back was killing me from sitting so long. Anyway this took the pain away as well as the stress. A+++++++++++++ and a nie buzz”"
JuicyJAndBlunts,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1671254,"“I’ve smoked this while mixed with other strains and ruins it. Smoked 1G in a Emerald white owl and had an amazing “trip type high” almost compatible to high grade Maui Waui/Blue Dream. Very positive and enjoyable!”"
NaturesBestie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1496001,"“I bought the Distilled extract and the flavor is amazing. It was relaxing and didn’t cause any anxiety like some strains. A definite repeat in the future.”"
mashoogana,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1785547,"“I am a Kush lover, and recently have been enjoying cookies. Found this and was like, this is a match made in heaven! Flavor and aroma are splendid, but what sets this strain apart is the effect. Just that happy, chill, euphoric, and alert buzz.”"
kelkollmorgen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1503884,"“I bought this strain from Spark1 in Bozeman.. easily my favorite strain I’ve had. The initiation time is about 30-40 mins so be careful or you WILL be couch locked. If not, just sit back and enjoy. You’re in for an awesome head high with a smooth body buzz that keeps you simulated. Highly recommend!”"
Crystalstutu,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1624764,"“This is the very best appetite stimulant I have ever tried. My doctor gave 2 thumbs up for the amazing results. Thank Goddess for this lovely lady!”"

edwardajaros,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1578090,"“Enjoyable enough but nothing to write home about unfortunately. I would say it does alleviate some pain but I didn’t find the same for depression.”"
Mrcoulrophobia,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-cream/reviews/1542396,"“This strain will knock you out quicker than you can get to bed. I ONLY smoke this right before falling asleep and if I wake up at night. I have very bad insomnia and this strain relaxes me and puts me right to sleep. The high leading up to falling asleep is very pleasant as well. Numbing my whole body before drifting off.”"
