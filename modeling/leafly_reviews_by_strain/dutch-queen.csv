Relaxing without making you lethargic, I found it good for a night of playing video games or doing chores with some good music playing. This is probably my favorite strain currently available in Spokane.”"

I walked in the weed store expecting to get like 2 grams and maybe a cheap J with the 20$ I had. Needles to say, it was 20% off sativa day.I took about 15 minutes browsing the menu, I asked the budtendet about the 20$ 1/8,being a tad weary myself. After talking with I'm I decided on a 20$ 1/8 of sativa , for only 15$. And the strain I got was this Dutch Queen. Its ...”"
cascadianpatriot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-queen/reviews/1351687,"“Good Sativa high. Good for getting things done and being in public. Not too heady. Very clear-headed. Very dense green buds. Gives a lighter high and a general feeling if well-being.”"
Gazeebo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-queen/reviews/1310681,"“I picked up a gram of Dutch Queen from a local place and the first thing I noticed was the 30.5% total cannabinoid content. It put me on my ass for 5 hours with a high that can only be described as intensely relaxing. Great strain!”"
titandreams911,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-queen/reviews/1178990,"“Wow.  I just finished smoking about .4 grams in a joint.  I'm sitting here just ripped out of my mind and I think I can almost fly if I really wanted too.  I didn't know there were yellow waves in the sky.”"
GinaKush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-queen/reviews/1254819,"“I bought this up in Aberdeen, WA. Was happy to support this local shop. 

Reasonably priced. 
Relatively useful as a Sativa Strain!”"

frankwilljr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-queen/reviews/1195777,"“This stuff is really good. So far the best weed me and my lady have come across. Really good for a bowl. Easy to hit. And really hard hitting saliva. Makes us silly. Good times Buddy Boy Farms. Keep it up”"
smoketillmyeyesbleed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-queen/reviews/1329014,"“real potent weed. I got really high off this really quick because of how strong it is! I love this weed I can get things done if I get up and do stuff but this weed really really relaxes you so it will easily couch lock you. love this weed because it's everything I look for in a strain...it can get me to do stuff or put me right to sleep while being really dank”"

hayseed94,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-queen/reviews/1205795,"“ok so i picked up 2G of Dutch Queen and it was 25.16% and it was enjoyable the aroma coming from the buds are very pungent.. smoking the buds when the high hits you it is pretty mellow and calming, you definitely will get couch locked and then if you listen to music the euphoric energy takes play and i spent an hour just rocking out and lost focus of what i was even doing great weed loved it bought another 4G today”"

dcru777,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-queen/reviews/1182339,"“I thought it was actually a really good sativa. Really long lasting. No fancy aroma. It is a piney earthy but very effective for active smokers. No mind fog. Good one for a good price.”"
