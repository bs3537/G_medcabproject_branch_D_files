I have a problem with not feeling any symptoms of cannabis until at least the second gram; however this strain had me relaxed and feeling great at my first blunt. i would recommend this strain to anyone that has a high tolerance and has joint problems. this strain has by far been one of the best strains I've tried”"

I'm not sure what it's testing at but from the feeling it's at around 20%. Great relaxation, with nice mental clarity. Definitely a Good strain to smoke before getting some work done or after you're done working. Either way, it's an all around nice herb to have throughout the day. ENJOY!!!”"

While this batch unfortunately didn't show any purple or lavender, it was a beautifully sugar-coated light green. Very light aroma, not like the earthy or cheesy smells of most strains. Buds are small, but tight, and have decent kief yield in the grinder.”"

What I like about alchemy is it allows you to be still present and aware of everything, while enjoying the stress relief and pain relief. It creates a warm sense of calm, along with a uplifted feeling. Focus is just slightly altered, but still able to get things done. 
Good for anytime, used it both during the day and before bed.”"

Didn’t do too much for my mood but helped with head and neck tension. Recommend for people with chronic migraines! High doesn’t last too long after a bowl.”"

Recomiendo que se queme lentamente el sabor es medio como un sabor pegajozo y muchas veces me quedan con recina los dedos de lo concentrada qu...”"
