It knocked out my chronic back pain, and mellowed my anxious monkey mind before bed. This is definitely a good evening or rainy day strain. Did I mention the sweet aroma & flavor? Yeah it delivers there too. Smells like a solid dank Indica, with that great sweet/earthy smell. I'll be coming back for this one....”"

Cascadia's got a really mellow, almost fruity taste (bought a 1g joint). Gives you a really heavy head high, sedating but maybe a bit overwhelming for a novice. I'd definitely buy it again!!”"

I'm a low tolerance, occasional smoker, so it only takes 2-3 puffs off the vape for this strain to kick in.  Not sure how long effects last;  I have been taking this before bed, so I am asleep by the time it wears off.  But, I will say that I have been sleeping very well and awakening refreshed.

So far, I have...”"

It's strong though, a little goes a long way. This strain is shapeshifter, shifting with the users set and setting from session to session. I have experienced, from the same batch a range between feeling supremely relaxing and serene moments while doing yoga, to having the biggest panic attack of my life, during a time when my intuition was des...”"
