Paxman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/atmosphere/reviews/1361454,"“absolutely bomb herb.  I was recommend this strain by a different dispensary.   I am so high right now it's retarded (no offense).  HIGHly recommend this strain.  The powers of White Widow and OG Kush are undeniable in this euphoric state of mind.  Love it.  Piney smell and flavor.   Just smoked about a bowl and a half and I'm scared to stand up haha.  So Cal Holistic...great stuff.”"

Was watching finding dory and felt the seagrass swaying against my skin. Perfect for watching movies at night being able to crash after. But also wanting to try in the afternoon! So so great. New go-to for sure.”"

It's just bomb.com. taste, smell, THE LOOK OF IT. I must say, I have never seen SUCH pretty flowers. Then to top all of that off, the high is SUPERB! I just bought the last 3 grams or so of what they had left and I'm devastated... But now I know and will be keeping my eyes peeled as should you!”"

Use clean glassware so you taste this spiciness in the sinus's”"

VividChaos,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/atmosphere/reviews/1247710,"“This is one of my favorite strains.  Its a very relaxing and euphoric high.  After a few min my entire body was relaxed, but I was still able to do small tasks, but they did take me a lot longer because I caught myself staring off into space!”"
EdwardEnigma,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/atmosphere/reviews/1246987,"“Smoked this while listening to Rihannas "Work" . Very Euphoric relaxed feeling thanks to OG Kushs nature. The white widow takes off the punch where you're still able to function. I love the smell..like pinsol.”"
begirl68,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/atmosphere/reviews/1707565,"“To me, Atmosphere feels exactly like it's name. One hit & I feel a light, fluffy sense of over all well-being that leaves me fully functional. I experience no sedation, paranoia or anxiety. A lovely daytime strain. A few more puffs leaves you relaxed & cozy for bed. No drama here, just smooth sailing.”"
