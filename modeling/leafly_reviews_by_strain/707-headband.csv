cbiddy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/707-headband/reviews/1410620,"“If properly cured, this is a GREAT Strain for the daytime. When Vaporized, it has an earthy flavor, that is smooth on the lungs.  The effects are almost instant, settle in slowly, and do not give the "sleepy's" when it wears off.   I do find myself "hyper focusing" for time to time, but for the most part "Headband" helps me to stay focused through out the day, while keeping the stress level down.”"
