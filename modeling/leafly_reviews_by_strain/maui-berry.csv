THE ONES WHO SAID IT WAS 2.7 STARS DIDNT UNDERSTAND THE MEDICINE ....ITS DAYTIME ... AMZING FOR STRESS/DEPRESSION
I DIDNT NEED MY PILLS AND THATS GREATTTT WHICH MEANS THEY DIDNT UNDERSTAND THE MEDICINE ITS AMAZING THAT I DIDNT HAVE TO TAKE PILLS FOR ANEXIETY AND WAS PERFECT AFTER I SMOKED THIS .....
Not too potent but strong enough to get you a nice chill ...”"
