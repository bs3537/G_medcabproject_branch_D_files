The medicinal qualities of this tasty strain waft of hashish and a semi-sweet, mild, but very pleasant, herbaceous fragrance. The medicinal qualities paralyze the body with a narcotic, THC cloud pillow—losing the majority of nociception from my neck down through my toes—while forgetting that I even had a body!
