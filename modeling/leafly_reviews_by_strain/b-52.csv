=============
ThatClassyBeast,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1359486,"“Like another reviewer said, it gives me more of a sativa high but still makes me feel relaxed.
Great strain though.”"
SirBronn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1359487,"“Pretty good strain. Has a pleasant sativa buzz at the beginning followed by a great mellow body high. Similar effeffects to that of God's gift to me. Kind of a sleepy come down but definitely not a couch lock. If it tasted and smelled better I would rate it higher.”"
GentlemanToker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1388212,"“I love this strain. I was pleasantly surprised to have such a sativa high dominant, even though the strain is predominantly indica. Would definitely recommend on a productive or sunny day. Highly recommend.”"
TheArkFilledWithWeed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1344615,"“Good indica, very earthy flavor. good cerebral and body effects.”"
macNcheesed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1380227,"“Damn! This got me! Nice dense nug, smells like skunky coffee. very potent,  off of 1 small bowl I time warped. It comes on quick with a nice stoney feeling and ramps up. Very energetic head high, but very relaxing body high to it.”"
josh100CH,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1349596,"“It just relaxes you in a very comfortably way, but I wasn't sleepy at all. I enjoyed the Strain, but the taste could be better and would make it more pleasant to smoke.”"
kdirty,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1671605,"“A great strain, not as sedating as most indicas but not Racey like most sativa's. A nice relaxing buzz. Nice dense little buds with orange hairs. The smell and taste matches the mellow high. All n all I like it and my guy has it a lot so haha”"
DeepStrain,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1367020,"“Good strain. Compact and easy to crush! Very potent choice! 9/10”"

CuhCooh,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1359488,"“I had this strain for awhile and it always made me fall asleep right after I smoked it and I like sativa more because I like to move around when I'm high”"
dday3000,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1337633,"“I dont agree with the relaxed and sleepy comments. This strain makes me energetic and hyper! Increases focus and high euphoric effects. A tiny hit of this strain will get you ripped.”"
jonchron44,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1574084,"“Great strain for before and during work! Smooth and earthy with a nice after cough 💨”"

limonene4me,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1584561,"“Smoked this way back in the day. It was locally grown outdoor in Northern Illinois. Grown off the Kishwaukee River. 

Very smooth and functional indica high, the skunk background shows up in this one. Buds were nice and tight, had good bag appeal.. especially at the time (we are talking late 90s). The whole "skunk" hype was huge back then so anything with it was prized. 

Hoping to run into this one again someday as ...”"

ArsonMontoya,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1278500,"“I'm not sure whether I like this, or hate it.

I've been using it as an evening strain because it relaxes me without making me sleepy, or couch locked.

though on the other hand, it sometimes just knocks me out right away, and I'm sleeping in 5.

I find for myself it's best enjoyed before dark.”"
Kerouac71,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1446758,"“Definitely a sweet taste to the bud I picked up this time. Haven't had this before very nice even keel with lots of laughs watching comedies for sure. Good relaxation effects while foggy still clear enough for minor tasking in my limited experience.”"
Tikinni3h,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1381624,"“Gave me a decent buzz, but made me sleepy after a while. The high was great though, but I've had better.”"
geckox,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1236014,"“I grew this strain from Nirvana and its definitely not indica dominant. It grows tall like a sativa and definitely has strong uplifting qualities. It's still a hybrid though so there's a bit of indica in there.”"
rayabaya,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1343004,"“In wax form it's just as great - smells sweet and earthy, bringing a nice head high still doable for work.”"

45% head, 35% boddy and 20% grounding.

I found this strain very usefull to visiolise your Qi flow. 
Afther seeing it, it's easyer to feel it in the parts of your boddy where you are not so connected to. 

For example... standing like a three.... evey figure you can find the meaning of the figure (posture) by just thinking of the name of the figure and visiolise how th...”"
maxwellbud,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1800944,"“i enjoyed. Good dank classic bud taste with a hint of what i describe to me as a berry woodish (forest) like after taste. 7.5/10”"
devewev,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1748003,"“Very spacey, cerebral high. Great strain for winding down and reading/writing before bed, and in small doses also a good little pick me up first thing :) I found it to be a little harsh on the lungs, and I've smoked a long time. Very potent stuff.”"

ChillinOnEndor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/b-52/reviews/1660325,"“Had a fun evening on B-52. Got a snack, danced to some Jay-Z in the kitchen, watched an episode of Portlandia that was funnier than usual, made out on the couch with my partner, went to the bedroom for some sexy times but we both completely passed out before sexy time could begin. Super relaxing strain, all my muscles just felt so nice. Pretty groggy in the morning, needed lots of coffee to function.
Lessons learned ...”"
