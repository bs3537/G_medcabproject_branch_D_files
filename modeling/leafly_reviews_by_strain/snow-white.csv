Snow White
=============
Kaliskunk28,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-white/reviews/1374977,"“After growing this strain for 8 yrs now, I've come to know it well. 

The buds are always a dark green that looks very pale because of the enormous amount of resin. There's a lot of dark brown/red hairs that cover the plant and give an extra fuzzy look to the nugs. The buds are usually round egg sized buds with an Indica look and Sativa feel. The leaves are round/Indica dom with a very strong fiberous quality to them...”"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snow-white/reviews/1417078,"“One of the best in Nirvana's line up. Sadly no dispensaries carry this wonderful strain around me. So I grow it myself and keep it on my top shelf. Great taste and aroma upon exhale you can feel the pain and stress of the day melt away. A must have for cancer paitients, or ANYONE suffering from any ailments. This is an all around top Medical strain in my opinion.”"

Smell: Potent spicy smell with a strong skunk undertone once broken up.

The fact that it is hybrid is really noticeable because you get the best of both indica and stativa worlds.
