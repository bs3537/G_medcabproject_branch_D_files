To start, this is a green house (sun-grown) strain so it's buds look different off the back. We will include picture late hopefully. The buds look dark green, but they look like the typical "weed you got from the guy down the street" kind of weed. It looks home grown, but if done well.

I found I became awake, alert and almost hyper.  Also, pain would melt away.  I didn't experience a *crash*.
