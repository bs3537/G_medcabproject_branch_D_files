CrazyDago,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1410037,"“I personally love the Ninja Fruit strain.  It is very relaxing for me and my "Go To" strain when I play video games.  I am growing it out now for the first time and it has been a very fun plant to grow. Very colorful.  It has a grape candy smell with a haze, woodsy backend as you pull your nose away.”"

After the VA started sending police to my home, I knew I needed to get help for my combat PTSD somewhere else, so I turned to the greener life. There were some strains that made me nod off while others seemed to pile shit on my anxiety, but not Ninja Fruit. I would definitely recommend this strain to anyone, but don't ask me to share my stash.”"

I tried also tried "dark helmet" which was also a great strain by OGS . I follow them on Instagram so I was excited to see their flower in my local dispensary. GREAT MEDICINE . if you have the opportunity to snatch any of their strains TAKE IT”"

This beautiful silver purple orange and green flower is on the mold side as far as "stoniness" goes - but it ALWAYS knocks my depression right out of me.  Has a lovely flavour thats just the right mixture of fruit and spice.  Also this strain gives me anxiety relief without making me feel "heavy".”"

BakedFreshDaily,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1555542,"“Ninja fruit is a deliciously fruity smelling and tasting strain with some of the most beautiful buds. The high starts out calm until you explode with productive energy. I would definitely pick ninja fruit over a coffee.”"
foreveryoung702,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1800437,"“I'm so glad I found this stain. Nice fruity taste and beautiful color bud. It's perfect for during the day. It's not to strong which I like because I can still get all the stuff I need to get done, done.”"

bart2000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1337647,"“Seriously smells like fruit loops, tastes good all the way through and a little bit of a creeper too.”"
The_Godless_Fox,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1393226,"“My boyfriend and I love this strain, It hits pretty quickly and keeps me really relaxed, a little frisky, and mellow but, not overly tired. We use this one mostly in the bedroom, it's also great mixed with a little Butter OG.”"
Yonex420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1362855,"“I had this last summer​ & it provided a mellow uplifting feeling. I wouldn't use this as a stress reliever or a sleep aid. This is one of those strains u roll up when ur with friends and wanna have a relaxing fun light whimsical time.”"
neoleafbaron,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1430815,"“NF has a good balance of energetic cerebral/sativa along with a nice body relaxation. It's the kind of strain that can be adjusted for morning or evening use,, at least in my experience. It's a fairly dense bud with lots of orange hairs. It has a soft piney and fruity smell. Would try again.”"
bigdudeluke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1369709,"“Really chill strain. Smoke this and you'll probably have a good time no matter what you're doing.”"
igrewsome,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1517161,"“I was lucky enough to get the last pack at the norcal high times cup summer 2017 and I loves it! Strong growth great yield gorgeous looking flowers with a loud grapey smell. I happen to get a green pheno with purple pink hues. Happy mellow stone. Pictures on my instagram/igrewsome cheers!”"
TrigeminalNeuralgiaBlows,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1638251,"“If there was a way to marry this strain I would. Talk about just the right strain for me, this is energizing, lightly cerebral and tastes nice and mild, not harsh on the throat. Have to admit, being from new england, you don't see much purple flower, actually in 25 years, I haven't seen any. It was like aborigines looking at a coke bottle when I opened up the container for the first time!”"
TommyTHEthcMultiplier,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1557336,"“Unbelievably strong strain, push and 28% THC. The most dominant and sweetest Smelling and tasting medicine around.   The best Connecticut has seen!   Perfect cure for insomnia, migraine headaches, and stress :-) Pure Bliss.”"

ZionLast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1560125,"“First time with this one. I really enjoyed it! Easy on the throat and with a sweet, fruity taste. A well balanced hybrid leaning toward Sativa with a nice yet mellow headbuzz that spreads to the body. Not the strongest strain for seasoned smokers but I like the way it leaves you in high spirits even hours after smoking. I only smoke joints btw..
A solid 4 all round.”"
Adz420dawg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ninja-fruit/reviews/1707282,"“Im not normally a fan of purple weed, but Ninja Fruits has that natural purple to green ratio. Beautiful nugs of purple bliss. Energetic yet focused high. Both grape flavours of the 2 plants that hybrid this beautifully grown flower shine through. 
9/10”"
