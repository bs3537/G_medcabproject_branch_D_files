Kind of a spicy smoke but you can taste berries as well.

This strain gets high marks for appetite stimulation, pain relief and sleep.”"

carcoma,https://www.leafly.com/indica/nicole-kush/reviews/1558763,"“Madurándola algo mas de lo normal cambia a un color azulado, completamente llena de resina, una pasada.. un olor fuerte a kush al fumarla que llena la boca por completo y dura mucho tiempo su sabor. Un subidón muy indico y relajante de larga duración. Su cultivo fue muy fácil de verdad, siendo una planta que tolera dosis muy altas de EC y que es una gran productora. Un 10.”"
