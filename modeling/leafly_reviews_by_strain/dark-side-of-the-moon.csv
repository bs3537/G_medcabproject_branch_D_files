Very smooth smoke, and the effects hit you instantly.  Half a joint and I was out cold, happily drifting off to sleep.  Should be called "Goodnight Mr. Moon". 

Great for anxiety ♥️”"

I am growing some F1 clones and am very satisfied with their progress. 
This has a berry flavor and is some of the best indica for insomnia I ever tried.”"
TechnoNshWeed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dark-side-of-the-moon/reviews/1382366,"“Simply one of the best medicine around for sleeping! An indica true to its nature. Gorgeous looking bud, tight, compact, dense, hints of purple and a beautiful tone of green. Smell is supa dank and sweet! Can't say I taste berries but it is definitely pleasant with Earth aromas. High is extremely indica and will have you feeling spaced out, slightly sedated. Although it approaches it in a very euphoric way and settle...”"

It really is a powerful relaxant. It doesn't leave you stuck, your thought process is clear, but it is VERY nap-inducing, in a good way. It will float you down gently without leaving you feeling hungover when you wake up like some indicas do. Smooth on the inhale, nice slightly sweet af...”"

The tension from the headache melts away (I haven't smoked during an actual cluster episode, but there is residual tension the day after and it's pretty painful. Anyway....if you are suffering from migraines, cluster headaches, etc, please find some and try it out. I used to only smoke sativa or sativa do...”"

Out of respect for the name I listened to some pink Floyd (which I normally don't listen to) and as a very euphoric high took over to the sounds in the music, all my pain and anxiety went away.”"

darklight,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dark-side-of-the-moon/reviews/1382511,"“There's nothing that could truly be said about this extremely rare *gem* of a strain from Exotic Genetix - at least not much which could do it proper justice.  This indica provides all one could ask for: relaxation (followed shortly after by sedation), psychedelic effects (among the most vivid of any strain out there), analgesic feeling throughout (gravity pulling you as you melt like butter), and a very nice look, s...”"

I've tried over the counter pain killers, I've tried my hydros, I've tried drinking water until I felt like Violet Boragard. Within 30 minutes of smoking my headache melted away.

SirSmith,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dark-side-of-the-moon/reviews/1241688,"“Talk about aromatic and bag appeal! This strain is a delight to smoke and even better to vape. Dont let the intensely fruity and sweet flavor fool you, this strain is a heavy hitter (at least the batch I had was).  Dark Purple medium sized buds were coated in trichomes. 

The medicinal effects were good for relaxation, sleep and stress relief.”"

kayercse,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dark-side-of-the-moon/reviews/1301056,"“Definitely make sure you don't smoke too much of this strain. it delivers a very intense high, and is great is you're planning on grabbing some munchies. also had the best sleep on my life, which is great considering i'm an insomniac. nugs are super dense and are primarily purple. the only downside is the dry mouth and it can make you dizzy if you smoke too much, even if you have a high tolerance.”"
