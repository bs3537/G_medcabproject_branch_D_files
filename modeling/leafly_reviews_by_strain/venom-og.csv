TheGreenestThumb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/venom-og/reviews/1415583,"“Venom OG IS is the epitome of kush. Leaving you hanging for just a moment and then blasting you in the face just when you start to doubt it. Great strain to smoke before bed, when you're trying to relax, or if you need an appetite because for some reason the munchies are ridiculous. But regardless it's 🔥 to say the least.”"

Extremely body-locking.”"

thecubb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/venom-og/reviews/1727555,"“I think this strand is definitely a good smelling strand. it definitely let you Linger on it after a while... I mixed it with some (😝)Sour Jack(🕴️) so it was a nice mixture of skunky( 🍋 )Limon mixed with the (🍊)citrusy lemon so it's a pretty good mix.

 I'm going to smoke this strand by itself while going to go see the movie Venom with Tom Hardy so maybe my next review will be awesomer

jiltob,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/venom-og/reviews/1070151,"“Best CBD-rich strain I've tried so far. Has a very smooth and tasty smoke to it. The high is all body, but the mind instantly relaxes. There's a slight tingling sensation. 

This is great day time weed. You can function doing most jobs on this herb; there's very little of the bouncy thoughts so common with hybrids / sativas. 

I will definitely be buying this strain again.”"
