The combination of 2 of my favorites was a genius idea. The taste is out of this world.

DrDre710,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-bubble/reviews/1414849,"“This strain is one that never disappoints. From the aesthetic appeal of trichome covered purple and green flowers to the delicious taste of berries with a hint of skunk blackberry bubble is top shelf medicine. The effects are heavy on the body and energetic and euphoric in the mind. Great strain for end of day pain, stress, and depression.”"
iamcherryface,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-bubble/reviews/1363588,"“Although it didn't make me sleepy like I'd hoped it did have a great smell and taste. Euphoric effect and caused me to have a rad conversation with the boyfriend. Eventually when I laid down to sleep about an hour after dosing I was able to rest peacefully. I would purchase this strain again for sure.”"

Commander_In_Kief,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-bubble/reviews/1362879,"“IT IS THE SOUL OF GOODNESS AND JOY AND IT MADE ME SO HAPPY I FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO BURST! Seriously, I have never used an indica that behaved this way.  It did not slow down my thinking, it was a very clearheaded strain. I felt like I was in a race car as I sat in front my PC, pouring over Leafly, wondering what the hell I had just vaped. The euphoria was more powerful than any I've experienced with indicas or sat...”"

lightweightlooser,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-bubble/reviews/1303728,"“I bought this on a last decision. I saw this strain and immediately noticed frosty trichomes on these amazing buds! This not only smells fantastic but tastes like sweet berries. This leaves you feeling heavenly and lost in a world of positivity. It comes with both a body and mind high for me. This is definitely a new favorite, I will be stocking up on this I suggest you do the same!!!!”"
Pongo1888,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-bubble/reviews/1320834,"“Clean, potent though not overwhelming. Very "safe" relaxed high without anxiety. Mind clarity is good for this indica. Day or night use but as their review states: 80/20 indica. Zero neg symptoms.”"

kittymang,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blackberry-bubble/reviews/1307765,"“This says indica dominant. I'm not one to get much benefit out of most indicas/dominant hybrids. But man!! This is one that is just BOMB. White and dark berry colored frosty nugulets. The sativa in it is juuust enough to provide anxiety relief and the indica is one of the very few that actually acts as a semi-sativa for me. Smoke it at night however. Because it can make ya tired. Sweet and tasty. Pungent. I get prett...”"
