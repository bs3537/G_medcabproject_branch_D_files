Let me just say this is excellent medication for depression, or lethargy. I medicated with .5g and noticed it made me upbeat, smile, and focused. After about 45 minutes into the session it faded into a nice body melt, and relaxation. If you see some of this- don't pass it up”"

Smells like Christmas trees, tastes like pine and lightens the heart and mind. Perfect uplifting mood without being too medicated. I found it made the whole holiday with ALL the family, very enjoyable. Oh and added benefits of not breaking ornaments or dropping the turkey due to "just right" medicinal dose.”"

Muscles and body become very relaxed, without feeling overly sleepy. When it is time to knock out, you will have absolutely no trouble. Smell is tropical, yet smells like blueberry.

For me, the heady sativa effect hit me first and followed with a nice and easy relaxing Indica effect and wasn't intense. Very enjoyable. You can taste the blueberry right away and wont be coughing up a lung to enjoy it.”"

Very good mood elevator and appetite stimulator.  A very good end of the day high.”"

It totally relaxed me, but I was still able to get stuff done around the house, be active and social!  I typically smoke before bed, due to being the worst sleeper ever... and once I came down off this one, I was totally relaxed and was out like a light all night.”"

Considered a Hawaiian heirloom by local farmers -- the debate rages on if this abundant Hawaiian blueberry Bush is a lost landrace or was one of the earlier strains bred by crossing DJ Shorts legendary masterpiece Blueberry with a local Hāiku Hawai...”"
themissingpatient,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-hawaiian/reviews/1745825,"“Tastes like pencil crayon shavings and sunscreen. Very mild effects and very slow to take effect. The Sativa of the Hawaiian strain overpower the Indica Blueberry quite a lot. It will help pick up your mood after or during a bad day but that's about it.”"

Unfortunately the dispensary I got my blue hawaiian from had it’s ratio listed incorrectly: 70% sativa & 30% indica. That is definitely not the case! Another reviewer described this strain as 45%sativa & 55% indica; this is far more accurate in terms of BH’s effects. I had a brief upswing of happy energy & then crashed hard....”"

We can now add Blue Hawaiian to the list of supa survivor strains with Puna Buddaz ready to weather elements and represent!!

Blue Hawaiian has a heady hashy tropical Blueberry flavor and a heavy hitting dank disposition known to keep minds blown!!!”"
TigerLily22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-hawaiian/reviews/1663340,"“This was easy to smoke, but honestly too easy. I smoked way too much and ended up being a paranoid mess. I think if I would have stuck to 1-2 hits I would have been fine but I went from smoking Purple Trainwreck to Blue Hawaiian and it was just way too much for me. I may try it again in the future because I was very giggly and euphoric at first and loved that part.”"
Jimmy420jackets,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-hawaiian/reviews/1698182,"“I'm in love with this live resin. Starts with a big hit to the head behind your eyes and then moves down to your whole shoulders and body. Perfect for night time smoking in my opinion. Gives you a great few hours before bedtime. Good for daytime however this can display dizzy qualities when out doing day to day activities so be careful.”"

Head buzz very strong without any anxiety/paranoia. Tastes like blueberry/pineapple heaven! Fyi, you are going to sleep; must be an indica dominant! :-) Highly recommend for medical/nighttime use.”"
