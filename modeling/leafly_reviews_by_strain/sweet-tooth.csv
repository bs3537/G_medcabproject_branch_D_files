Sweet Tooth
=============
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-tooth/reviews/1417777,"‚ÄúIts a dry woody pungent flowery taste and smell. If you have massive depression you'll want to do SweetTooth. It has an outstanding knack for making you feel better, very sticky and dense round nuggets in deep green & orange hairs. These compact buds give you the smell of fruit and spicy flowers. Do not pass up Sweet Tooth, but bring a jug of water this strain will make you thirsty.‚Äù"

Let me just say that this weed does not make you feel like an insane clown, as one reviewer here has suggested. Unlike like my co-host on the Voice singer/songwriter Miley Cyrus, this weed is very good at numbing the pain of existence.

First few hits are very heady and body stimulating and goes on to be a euphoric trip the rest of the way through. Was in a bad mood but now my thoughts are uplifted and I have to say I'm not too hungry right now but it sets in later. The sativa dominant effects are pleasing and it's indica properties ease you into a relaxing body high.‚Äù"
