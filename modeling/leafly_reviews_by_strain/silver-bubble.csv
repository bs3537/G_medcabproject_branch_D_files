Looks great (tight, dark nugs) smells great and doesn't empty the wallet like some strains out there. Awesome. Definitely a go to strain.”"
Hazekushlover29,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-bubble/reviews/1370212,"“Really sweet sleepy high considering it has haze and northern lights in there, though this is some of the next gen of haze reminded me of bubblegum were most haze reminds me of lemon/lime. Definitely recommend this to regular smokers.”"

MrVV,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/silver-bubble/reviews/1378505,"“Silver bubble is a strain that will mark you for life. From the sweet smell, to the powerful uplifting buzz, this strain will quickly become a staple in your medicine cabinet. Smoking a silver bubble joint Is akin to being strapped into a satin saddle attached to a rocket ship. Also, the concept of time goes the way of the dodo bird. Enjoy responsibly.”"

And after I went home & smoked this wonderful flower, I was not disappointed! Maybe a bit of a creeper, but once she hits you, you'll be thrown for a loop! Along with the heavy effects, I was still functional/up and about, but maybe not excited a...”"

Amazing to smoke, very smooth and a very hazey taste. Got complete body tingle and then was couch locked which is when I felt dead. Was just so relaxed and got unreal body tingle that made me feel the most relaxed I've ever been. 
Got extreme dry eyes, and dry mouth. 
Also a little paranoid and very thoughtful. Amazing strain 5/5”"

I walked the town non stop for 5 hours plus before I realized how high I had been. Almost like a positive drunk, happy but energized state w none of the stuttering and imbalance issues.
