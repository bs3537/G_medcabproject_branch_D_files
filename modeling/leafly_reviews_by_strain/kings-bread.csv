Smell is skunky and pungent, but less so that other examples of Lamb’s Bread, with undertones of citrus and haze. Smoke is smooth and pungent like the smell, with a defined sharpness similar to Jack Herer or Haze. Effects are felt quickly, with a heady, cerebral and soaring type head high. I felt extremely euphoric and giggly, ha...”"

Also I had tried Lambsbread before and was not impressed (Kings Bread is apparently a close relative). So getting this strain was a bit of a gamble.

But it was surprisingly good - I had a nice trippy time. Read on for the details:

The buds are tight and nice-looking with frosting, but not sp...”"
RoseOCPG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kings-bread/reviews/1062183,"“King's Bread is hybrid sativa dominate strain, which has a delectable taste.  Great sativa that will not induce anxiety, always a plus.  It even allows one to remain alert while feeling relaxed and euphoric.  This strain is also one of the grandparents of Bob Marley's Lamb's Bread.”"

Result is a much stronger plant but still an accourance of gardening technique.”"

It has a strong flavor, earthy and a bit pungent it has a hint of lemon. This is one of my all time favorites. If you see it, buy it.”"

Sharpish,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kings-bread/reviews/1342530,"“A very energetic, thoughtful high. I smoke this regularly and get no fuzziness at all. Tight, conical buds with strong citrus and pine odors. Not the bud to couch-lock you. Makes me want to go for a walk!”"
soulbarn,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kings-bread/reviews/1062184,"“Took two hits off Magic-Flight; I'm relatively low-tolerance and that was too much, and I felt a little flattened - the good mental effects were there, but I was too weighed down to take advantage of them. Very optimistic, though, that a lower dosage would feel lighter and more energizing.”"
OVORupert,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kings-bread/reviews/1343063,"“As a college student, I dont pick up sativa strains too often but something told me to venturr into the realm of sativas and I wasnt disappointed. MmmMmmMmmMMMMMm soo tasty. On exhale it tasted like sweet pine, silky smooth hit 👌 immediately I felt lighter, not physically or "mentally" but in my SOULLLLL. beautiful. I can't comment on bud beauty because I got the end of the batch because the strain sold out way too ...”"

jaxygyrl,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/kings-bread/reviews/1334655,"“I bought King's Bread because of its high ranking in "creative" effects, and the other positive effects sounded great too: focused, euphoric... It definitely turned on my Talkative side. The Euphoria was there in abundance... it was magical. 

Overall, the experience was of an intense yet clean happy place. And magical.”"
