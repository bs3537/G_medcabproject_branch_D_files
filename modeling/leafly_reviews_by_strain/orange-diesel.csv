Orange Diesel
=============
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-diesel/reviews/1416014,"“What an all around smooth buzz. A delight from the first puff to the last. The smoke is soooo smooth. Very little coughing and the smell and taste is like...well... oranges.

The high is focused and euphoric, powerful, but not over the top. It is easy to manage social situations and still feel great without the "stoned" look.

I would recommend.”"
Munchiez2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-diesel/reviews/1417246,"“pretty good buzz really spacey almost at first but becomes a really relaxing focused high that's really potent I gotta say I'm pretty happy with this strain but I think I couldn't have spent 40 bucks better definitely a great Sativa feel nothings really lacking gotta love the diesel genes”"
DocGanja,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-diesel/reviews/1717601,"“In my top three you’ll find Sour Cookies, Cotton Candy, and in first place my all-time favorite Orange Diesel. What a pleasant experience truly, never have I had such an amazing tasting bud. I kid you not, ever hit I took it tasted like I was taking a bite from a fresh orange. Like, no joke I swear it tasted just like the fruit. And the high was pretty nice too, my dad and I were on our way to my grandmas house after...”"
juniorstoner14,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-diesel/reviews/1395659,"“Good head high, the type of high where you gotta listen to the best tunes you can find and just relax. Munchies will be needed and eyedrops( if you live alone or like your eyes bloodshot then your fine) are a definite need for this strain. Overall very good head high and gives you energy and uplifts you.”"
Bubbles1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-diesel/reviews/1266499,"“The stuff I got is locally called Orange Turbo (NYC Diesel and Orange Velvet) I love the all over good feeling of this bud! I hit lightly because other reviews said it was potent. I am a huge fan of orange and purple strains for Fibromyalgia. This takes care of fatigue, stress and stiff muscles well. Highly recommend listening to Etta James Radio on Orange Diesel!”"
flufferfucker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-diesel/reviews/1341847,"“Great strain amazing head high and it's very relaxing. Has more of a diesel taste than anything but you can taste hints of orange. If you have the option to smoke this strain take it.”"

raeeraee92,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-diesel/reviews/1470441,"“I suffer from intense anxiety and panic along with depression. I've struggled on and off trying to find a strain that didn't give me more of either. whether anxiety, paranoia, or sluggish. with orange diesel, my heart rate is dramatically lower at the peak of a high than any other strain(it's usually on the higher side). with that being said, it's actually a little lower than without weed. someone who struggles with ...”"

dankestdankdatsdank,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-diesel/reviews/1395690,"“Great smelling bud. For those who some how don't like the smell of og's this is a very good smell for u. I suggest your first hit of this to be a small one, as the effects settle in almost instantaneously. A great bud smoke plenty of(within limits). Very good bud to roll, but is also very smooth in a bong.”"

Only problem I had with this was the feel of it, the nugs I had were close to the feel of regs, that really dried type. But needless to say the bud had tons of orange in it, and boy it gets you gone! I was good off 2-3 bowls (sharing with a friend) and it hit me hard!”"
NickyBuds25,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-diesel/reviews/1528638,"“A very potent head high that provides a cerebral experience. The more you smoke, the further you tumble down a rabbit hole. Sometimes, at your own risk.”"
Crodz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-diesel/reviews/1523696,"“Wow. What an awesome Strain. I’m not normally the biggest Sativa person, but I was thoroughly impressed.

I smoke it out of a new pipe and it had a very fruity orange taste after blowing the smoke out.
