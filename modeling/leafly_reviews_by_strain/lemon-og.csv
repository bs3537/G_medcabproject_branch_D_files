Lemon OG Kush

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og/reviews/1397508,"“Fast onset, start feeling it as soon as you exhale with full effects after less than 10 minutes. Happy, euphoric, nostalgic. Play your old favorite video game on this or watch your old favorite move; you'll be all smiles. Comedown is sleepy but not groggy. A personal favorite.”"

I has a great taste, and gives one a sativa-like cerebral high, yet has the pain reducing and insomnia reducing effects of an indica. This is the best medical marijuana I have ever tried so far. They knocked this one out of the park.I have fibromyalgia and this helps me tremendously. Two thumbs up!!”"

SamKonkin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og/reviews/1366209,"“The scent is mellow and somewhat similar to OG Kush, not citrus-sour nor skunky.  There's a bit of fruitiness to it.  I'd say it's one of the best smelling strains I've had.  The buds themselves are light green from heavy trichrome dusting.   They are tight, dense buds and are marbled with light orange hairs which are similarly trichrome covered.  Under a magnifying glass, the buds just look beautiful.  The smoke tas...”"

Jeffrock420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og/reviews/1076271,"“A fantastic Kush strain! This stuff, when grown properly, is one of the more perfect strains in exsistance. The structure of the buds are like hard, tight , medium size buds covered with crystals and smelling a little bit like a skunky rose. I liken the effects to that of OG Kush, although the sativa properties lend an uplifting feeling initially. Lemon smells way better than the OG as well. This is one you can smoke...”"

After two treatments courtesy of my vaporizer, I was in a mental stupor - zoning in and out.  If you have lofty goals and a lot to get done, this is definitely NOT what I would be medicating with!  I'll stick to my Jack for that.  I actually started to trip after a solid two trenches on my magic-flight.  By far the most potent indica I've ever had...”"
