Awesome bud from Falcanna. This batch had a 34.8% THC content. I have severe PTSD and depression and this had me laughing my ass off to Bojack Horseman. Very happy carefree floaty almost opioid-like effect.”"

Nice and stoney, strong visual buzz and a relaxing body high. Amazing for depression/anxiety, as it gives a high that's insanely euphoric.  Can't help but feel love and gratitude when you smoke this! Adding to my list of favorites.

P.S. Make sure to have water on deck because the cotton mouth is REAL.”"

This is the best weed in the world, I'm positive about it. I can smoke this and be ready for anything the day throws at me. Good for hanging out with friends, pain relieving, creativity, productivity, chilling out, outdoor activities, etc, etc.

Truly exceptional taste and smell. My absolute go to. I wish there were more than 5 stars, becau...”"

Heavily dusted with crystals, a strong skunk smell with a smooth, sweet taste. (Vaped). Powerful sedative effects and plenty of couch lock with the 25.6% batch I had.”"

iansage554,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pacific-blue/reviews/1580499,"“Sure does the job of a true indica dominant strain,

first off with its overwhelmingly earthy taste as your body is covered with a tingling sensation as your limbs start to weigh letting the pain go away.

second off with its continued use of the strain it’s overwhelming earthiness dials down to a low as a flowery taste becomes mid level while your taste buds bathe in a blueberry taste. 

Definitely recommend as an i...”"

anxietygurl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pacific-blue/reviews/1698617,"“Without a doubt, one of THE best and most potent flower I have tried.  Euphoric and absolutely encapsulates the user in a tingly high; helps open the mind and zone in on a lot of ideas and thoughts; will kick depression in the a** for sure! Not sure if I would recommend before bed or not, it was quite relaxing for the body but also quite stimulating for the mind with all the ideas. Very beautiful smelling/looking flo...”"
GreenGreenWA,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pacific-blue/reviews/1716124,"“Falcanna isn't perfect. My batch looked good however the flower was still damp and had a weird aroma like compost tea that wasnt flushed. I wish WA let consumers smell and hold the bud before purchase.. It was my first Falcanna bought product and i like their growing methods so i'll chalk it up to human error...they get 1 more chance from me”"
HdzCln,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pacific-blue/reviews/1730978,"“I need a strain that can chill me out, I've always like smoking sativa strains but its been keeping me up way too late. This strain can give me a calming feel especially in the evening, its great as a pre roll it comes in 2pk which I like a lot!”"
