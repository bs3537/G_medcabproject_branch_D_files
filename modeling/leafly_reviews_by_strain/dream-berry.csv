I sometimes get anxious after smoking high stavia strains and found the indica strains work best for my anxiety and stress. I like that Dream Berry relaxes me but I can still function around the house in a nice, euphoric calm without my brain stressing about stupid stuff. It tastes great too. I'll buy this one again for sure but will continue to try other indica stains as I'm only...”"
EddyHaze,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dream-berry/reviews/1374651,"“Let me start by saying this. I had only bought about an eighth to try it out. first 2 pulls and i was instantly in love with this strain. it doesn't hit hard on you. It gently creeps up. Youre up in the clouds before you even realize it. A very relaxing high. I would definitely recommend this to all of you. it's top 10 material. Absolute top shelf stuff”"

LucahLou,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dream-berry/reviews/1803157,"“Grabbed a couple of rolls on my way to some springs. After I smoked the entire roll while waiting outside; I must agree that this has an incredibly smooth start. Does creep in.  Mood uplifting. Did cause some dizziness and I did develop headache! I hate headaches and NEVER get them. Otherwise, this was my favourite strain by far. Loved the flavour. Loved the high. Wish the headache didn’t come with it!”"

UncleMikeyB,https://www.leafly.com/indica/dream-berry/reviews/1150979,"“This strain is, simply put, tasty. I like the taste of berries in it mostly. I would definitely recommend this strain for an all day smoking strain, due to the mellowness of the high. I will be smoking this some more now. Cheers!”"
