Jacked-Up
=============
IandI,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jacked-up/reviews/1344611,"“Kind of have love/hate relationship with Jacked Up. Definitely arousing and creative. The ideas come fast and furious, along with the munchies. While stimulating creatively, this strain drops me into an introspective mood and I get way too engaged with my ideas/thinking, making it difficult to connect with my lover or other people. Might be a good one for solo pursuits (writing, music, video games, walking in nature)...”"

I couldn't tell you much about the taste because, quite honestly, when I smoke it I really don't get the taste sensation - however, when you vape it then you can definitely get the taste effects.  Just inhale and breathe out slowly through your nose....”"

Johndoe883205,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jacked-up/reviews/1670413,"“Was not a big fan of this strain. Biggest thing with me was the headache afterwards. Tasted and looked amazing. And the high was very nice. But afterwards is when the headache kicked in.”"

ib9ahhhh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jacked-up/reviews/1754006,"“Best high I’ve had by far. Smells really sweet and doesn’t give you couch lock that usually comes with a heavy high. Not too bad when it comes to munchies and helps with my chronic pain condition. 10/10”"
HighAF702,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jacked-up/reviews/1470249,"“Didn't find anything special about this strain. Purchased a couple of rosin rocket pre-rolls. The first one was rather uneventful. The second one a few days later gave a decent high but nothing earth shattering.

I could go either way on this so probably would not be in a hurry to repeat.”"

Marico,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jacked-up/reviews/1339060,"“It's got that punch to the chest.

This strain has a very stong tangie/piney flavor to it and right out of the bag it smells just like that classic dank. Another strain I could say is very similar to this one would probably Grape Gush or Gorilla Grape Ape. I feel dumb for smoking this at 2 in the morning because now I feel like doing everything I had planned to do when I woke up haha.

This strain is that jet lift to...”"

JadedTakesThisSerious,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jacked-up/reviews/1339058,"“This one gave me a slight headache.  The buzz was heady and an upper, but honestly not so much that I couldn't work or anything like that.  Without the headache it could be a good daytime med.”"
StealthCondition,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jacked-up/reviews/1373800,"“Jacked-Up, potent sativa! Fruity aroma, arousing, made want to just do stuff! Overall 10/10. Big much factor, but not too much to handle. This is a good train for sleep!”"
erenamacarena,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jacked-up/reviews/1373799,"“I have a love/hate relationship with this strain! It was good for being awake (and some fun sex) but definitely have had a couple minor irrational anxiety attacks while smoking it... If you struggle with anxiety, this strain is not for you!”"
