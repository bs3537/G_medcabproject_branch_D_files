Jakermiester,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-star/reviews/1287628,"“Ever since I obtained my MMJ card, I have been on a constant search for the perfect strain for anxiety, as well as one that will let me be energetic and get things done. This "Morning Star" strain is definitely in my top 5. I tried it based on reviews from this site, and was not disappointed. The color is deep, almost looks outdoor grown. The buds I got initially taste a little dirty, but still sharp and skunky. The ...”"

Couldn’t sleep was very tired but couldn’t sleep. Asked for some pot that wouldn’t keep me up like JACK HERER does but wouldn’t make the head hurt like HARLEY MANDALA. I had forgotten all about MORNING STAR and brought it into The Decompression Chamber and grinded some up, packed a bowl and wrote the following after taking two hits:

MORNING STAR: Batch #: 151112 THC: 15.20% CBD: 0.4...”"

chunt517,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-star/reviews/1182732,"“Well there isn't a lot bad or good about this bud. It's actually great for people that like to smoke but usually have stuff to do during the day. It doesnt last very long and it isn't very strong...but it's real pretty and does give me a good cerebral, or head high. Absolutely no couch lock, I smoked it and went for a walk, nature was very pretty and walking was just fun.”"
fuzzykazoo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-star/reviews/1224051,"“A safe, mellow, pleasant high that lets you sink into a good creative session. it doesn't get you too cerebral, but it focuses you and lets you concentrate while feeling relaxed.  also, uplifting and chill. makes you go with the flow. not abrasive.  love reggae and hip hop something with an up beat, but smooth. lovely. comforting. warm, yet stimulating. just like the name implies. a bit euphoric. positive. optimistic...”"

njnickd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-star/reviews/1167750,"“Strong effects on all senses. This strain definitely improves alertness and reaction. Down side is it makes the body much to heavy.”"
DarthCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-star/reviews/1061962,"“Smell: Floral green and citrus orange peel. It is overall a very subtle scent.

Taste: like a light pulp free orange juice. Easy in and out. A smoke you could smoke all day without losing a lung.

High: Totally chill and relax. Very alert and yet pretty ripped at the same time. I would say I can function no problem on this all day while being in a funk.”"

Novsamar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-star/reviews/1371010,"“Literally gave me a headache. Good smell and taste just wish it had less of that effect.”"
slothBOP,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-star/reviews/1441490,"“I just took 2 good lil dabs of some morning star shatter out of my honeycomb perc bong and this is a very tasty strain. It has this skunky citrusy orange smell with earthy berry undertones. This strain delivers a mostly sativa like high that really gets your brain going. Makes you feel uplifted, motivated and energetic with a chill euphoric feeling. Would recommend for a wake and bake or during the day time”"

JFraser1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-star/reviews/1334783,"“I used ONLY THIS STRAIN shortly before commencing with WITNE✡✡ TESTIMONY.  It was indeed prescribed by a local cannabis medical prescription dealership when I was living in Chino Hills, CA - and it helped to PRIME OUT ALL OF THE FOREIGN/ALIEN CONTAMINANTS in order to help prevent cancerous growth (cannabis fights off over 100 known strains of catalyzed cellular hyper/hypo growth abnormalities) - while also cleaning o...”"
lowtide,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-star/reviews/1182733,"“The buds are very dense, the  crystal content is very frosty, orange hairs, forest green in color. The aroma is earthy, the most dominant fruit smell is grapefruit, but also a bit of tart raspberry. The high lasts incredibly long, it's very alert, and relaxing. 24% THC on the low end I'd guess. I've been working with it for ten years, the yields are bar none, double than any other strain I've worked with. Resistant t...”"
morrie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-star/reviews/1061957,"“OK, this is my favorite strain.  Except I can never find it.  It smells very sweet.  It is very very euphoric, yet clear, not heavy.  Mystical in terms of creativity, and focus.”"

Can't wait to sleep to wake'n'bake again”"

thefirerises,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-star/reviews/1247364,"“It's pretty strong. The effects start out as very energized and focused, almost like the sun is shining brightly on your face, but slowly and surely, darkness creeps in and couch lock, the indica properties of this strain make for a pretty horrible come down, in my experience. Usually when the indica effects of it hit me, I become quiet, withdrawn and moody- which I don't like at all. I like uplifting and energetic s...”"
