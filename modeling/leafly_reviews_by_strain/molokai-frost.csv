This strain prompted me to write my first review because it would be a dishonor to the islands of Hawaii for not promoting this incredible flower. After purchase i waited until the next morning to smoke it, i wanted to feel fresh. After breaking the seal, Moloka'i's raw nature-like odor climbed up inside my nostrils and started f**king. I let the scent do its thing until it was finished and then loaded u...”"

Another amazing medicine made its way out of the valley in Kalawao (pronounced ka-la-wow) that same fateful year, 1969.

Originally named Moloka'i Hashplant by local growers because of her frosty trichrome rich disposition and to distinguish Moloka'i Hashplant or Kalawao kine from Maui Wowie, ...”"

I bought this in Vancouver recently, and wow, do I wish this were more readily available at home (Seattle).  So, from the softest inhale that felt mouth watering, I kid you not, it was like buttah.  If you know the difference between hard and soft water, this was like falling into a spring of soft water.     Relatively quick to activate brain activity, the benefits were complet...”"

A Seattle newspaper even wrote a epic article about a MMJ dispensary called Columbia City Holistic Health and their most medicinal marijuana: 

Moloka'i Frost!!

Once again we have to say Mahalo to the staff @ Leafly for writing such a lovely informative review and providing patients a platform to review and share our experiences.

Aloha a hui hou!!!”"

The smell is definitely tropical & unique. Almost has a zesty scent.
The high lasts quite awhile & makes me space out during the first half. Second half of the high I'm running around with energy.
Forget...”"

Forget just buying a gram buy a half oz. Or better yet if you find the concentrate buy as much of it as you can & tell us how it is!”"

Oh this strain. I love this pungent earthy scent, smooth and great tasting smoke. Sticky enough to aid in usage but not too much as to cause a nuisance. Denser bud until busted. Then beautifully fluffy and lovely to roll ❤ 
Definitely recommend this strain to anyone who wants to relax and get something done at the same time. Perfect for parents after the kids go to bed or people who just like to get c...”"
