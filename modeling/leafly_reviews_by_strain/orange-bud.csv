Kimberley,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-bud/reviews/1412773,"“I love this one. The first time I tried this I was so impressed with the scent. You almost don't even need incense. I love the smell & taste but, the way it makes me feel...I packed my water pipe, took a few hits & the next thing I know I have candles lit everywhere, Enigma's "Dreaming of Andromeda" playing on repeat while cooking. Sex feels almost tantric with this. It makes you feel sensual. It heightens all of you...”"
Bunny,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-bud/reviews/1376988,"“I've found that some people claim this strain to be ordinary... and I've always found that what they've been smoking is not even Dutch Passion's Orange Bud or simply it hasn't been grown properly/cut early. 
It likes organic style of growing much better, but it could be fed with pretty much everything - very tolerant strain, that is...
The high creeps on  you - in the first 10 to 15 minutes it clears everything up ...”"
the_reaf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-bud/reviews/1390913,"“Got a new harvest. This one is in definite something you like to consume if your bones are hurting and every single movment feels like frozen hell. When being alone, this strain tends to make me very relaxed, sleepy and produces some gentle hallucinations which I really enjoy. But when having company, it make me talkative, giggly and I feel energized and happy.”"

Windy1time,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-bud/reviews/1260041,"“Beautiful taste. The fuckin guy told me it was a more mild high and not too strong for people that don't smoke all the time. I got confused as fuck on this weed. Nearly missed the last train back to my hotel because I had no sense of direction, and couldn't even remember the name of the place I was staying. Plus my girlfriend could'nt stop laughing her arse off, and talking absolute shit. Which wasn't helping anyone....”"
Mythax420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-bud/reviews/1259809,"“I started smoking Orange when my depression got to it's lowest point. Since I started Orange I feel like doing things, grocery shopping, gaming, writing you name it. It's a great uplifting high that really helps me cope with my depression. Highly recommended for other depression sufferers.”"

Very nice smoke, burns to white ash if grown organic and cured well. Best to be cut at 70% white and 30% amber trichs - that's when it's most potent... It usually takes about 63-65 days of flowering to get there.
When smoked in smaller quantities, it gives a very nice uplifted high. Absolutely opens my mind up for ANY ideas... Of course, the more you smoke, the more ideas become less unde...”"

The only reason I'd give this strain 3 stars is because the effects are really short lived. And because I like to be stoned with as minimal as possible, this just doesn't impress me much. 

I will say that because it's so short lived that it makes a great quick dose of medication.

It does give a wonderful high, almost like a happy hug. :) 
After that, I'm happy and a bit more centered fe...”"

This particular strain gets you faded off of one hit and it makes you feel as if everything is a dream. Be prepared to feel buzzed for quite a long time.

The effect is very pleasant and relaxing.
I would recommend to watch a film or to
have sex with your girlfriend during the effect.”"
Maj391,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-bud/reviews/1313931,"“On first open of the jar, these buds smelled a bit like orange beef for the local Chinese food place.  Some kind of funky meaty smell backed by some dried orange peel.  There is a faint smell of fuel, far off in the background of everything else. When breaking it up, however, the smells really changed.  A pungent, oniony smell with a metallic/hazy backbone comes forward.  Lots of crystals, sticky, lots of auburn hair...”"

Rooster,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-bud/reviews/1138257,"“I'm bit unsure on the ratingsystem. But, for me is the Orange Bud from www.Dutch-Passion.nl one of the best strains ever manmade... Easy to grow and get cuttlings from. Easy to grow and expand to an fullrupture budplant!

It don't gives you so much, 20-40 grams, but what a buds!!

As far as i know, they are the only coffeeshop in amsterdam that sell it.
The high its quite weird, definitely sativa and not indicouch, but not that uplifting as i thought it will be. JH/LH/SSH are far more suited for that purpose.
All in all, a nice strain and great bang for the buck - 3.2 grams for only 20 euro!”"

First, and most impressively, it's a total mood changer.  Your mind feels positive even in the face negativity. I've never had that before.  I'm in my 30's.  This has the potential to put benzodiazepines out of business.

It gives a mellow headhigh with a nice body stone. It makes you very happy and everything in life seems nice. 
It is an indica dominant strain so it makes you rather hungry and as you start to come down sleepy. 
Overall a very nice strain.”"
