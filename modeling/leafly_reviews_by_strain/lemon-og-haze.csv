Lemon OG Haze
=============
iLoveMedicinalMMJ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1389804,"‚ÄúFirst time reviewer here. Lemon OG haze has landed itself in my personal top three favorite MMJ Sativa strains that I've had the pleasure of smoking.  If you keep your buds in mason jars, you're going to have to control yourself from opening the jar just to take a whiff of that semi sweet, citrusy smell that puts a smile on your face every time. You can even taste a hint of lemon every time you inhale.

El420Kevo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1394301,"‚Äúa well balanced hybrid giving both energetic raciness to sedating Couchlock if you overdo it. which I do. I actually am the guy who suggested to leafly that they cover this strain and am mega happy to see they did. fell in love with it last year when I done a 5 pack and was presented with 5 different phenos one which I loved, a more las Vegas lemon skunk typed pheno. still dream of it. love it. going to get more seed...‚Äù"
hunter9231,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1390393,"‚Äú‚Ä¢ this review is for T 25% hybrid flower that smokes like a sativa leaning-hybrid, which I prefer as my morning smoke. Extremely easy on asthma, and the angst I had been feeling dissipates immediately as a calm takes over.. Flavor is good, albeit pretty mildly-lemon.. hoped for more. Another oversized hit in, head-to-toe warming+relaxation, as creativity+focus spark, and I look forward to the project at hand. This is...‚Äù"

woltza,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1390392,"‚ÄúGreat taste if flushed well.  Curbs anxiety and major phantom pain and chronic back pain/arthritis.  Helps me pass out if I dab or vape concentrate.  Worth a try if you're body chemistry is upside down and indicas dom hydrids are too much for you!‚Äù"
realsmoothrealicy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1333591,"‚ÄúHosted a house party and hotboxed with a few guys before going to the club in the basement. I have to say i was really energetic and alive. Its great for social. Not something i would smoke alone to write songs or chill‚Äù"
brookwithnoe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1658062,"‚ÄúHas to be my favorite strain so far. Where my muscles hurt, I now feel lifted. Where my depression hit, I now am thanking God for fleeting moments. Perfect taste of sweet earthy lemon. 10/10 would recommend.‚Äù"
Germafornia,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1439466,"‚ÄúI bought the Reserve Oil Cartridge from Nevada Botanical Science Inc. and the first thing I had to recognize was the beautiful taste! It's really lemony and you can just taste the Haze hybrid. 

A beautiful strain that always gives me an energized high and makes me happy!‚Äù"
PortlandSmoke207,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1346240,"‚ÄúThis strain gave me a lot more of a head high, it was pretty intense. Thoughts were flowing like the Nile river my friends. Lemon OG haze will creep up on you like Brainy from "hey Arnold" (90's TV show Reference) so I suggest starting slow with this strain because she packs a punch!‚Äù"

treyvonkhalil,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1342341,"‚ÄúINCREDIBLE 

I have had many lush stains before ( all wonderful. )
But the OG LEMON BAZE IS GOAT. the color, the textures, ( trichomes ), the flavor!!! As we speak I'm stoned AF tasting lemon on my tongue, super sweet taste! And very pungent definitely recommend this!

Deadpoolz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1309157,"‚ÄúThis strain was very smooth. The taste was lemony citrus. I got a little paranoid. I was also very relaxed. Great strain overall!‚Äù"

hemlocklily,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1365223,"‚ÄúI wasn't blown away by this one. It did everything it was supposed to do (took care of pain and nausea symptoms) but it seemed to hit super hard (causing some anxiety) and then wear off quickly. It would be good to get through something short-term I guess, like a stubbed toe lol...but not my fave choice for chronic medicinal purposes. If it lasted longer, it would get a much higher rating from me.‚Äù"
Fuckpestilenceo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1346239,"‚ÄúGot me a mature Lemon og haze strain couple of weeks back one of the most potent dominant sativas hybrid I've smoke. You get tons of energy for a long time if smoke all day it's great for insomnia and you get really hungry too.  Perfect strain to mix with kushy punch strawberry sativa. Every food taste delicious and you can't stop eating.‚Äù"
NewcastleReviews,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1433506,"‚Äúgreat smoke. takes a little longer to dry this bud but cures amazingly‚Äù"
froggyfritz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1568742,"‚ÄúThe best way I can explain this strain is, listen to Bump n‚Äô Grind by R. Kelly, and swap the words ‚Äúmind‚Äù & ‚Äúbody‚Äù in first two lines of lyrics. LO.G.hZ had my mind racing and my body submersed into a state of immobility! Also, lost all the moister in my mouth and eyes! I almost bumped the star count up to 4 for this strains arousal effects, but the cotton mouth will leave you and your S.O. unable to do anything oral...‚Äù"

Odneyray,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1683933,"‚ÄúIn my experience its Great outdoors! Beautiful and Pungent. Definitely a strong Sativa presence. Mid to late afternoon sun perfect last 2 months. It reaches for the stars! Lol‚Äù"
Ostrodamus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-og-haze/reviews/1714500,"‚ÄúNot a lot to say about this strain. It was citrus-y and didn't taste bad, but in the grand scheme of things I didn't see a huge difference between this strain and a lot of other strains. It did relax me and put me in a DGAF mood. Unlike some other reviews, I didn't get happy or energetic, but maybe it was because I was a bit tired to start.‚Äù"
