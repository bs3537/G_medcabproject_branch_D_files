One problem with these reviews is that we might not actually be talking about the same strain even though it is named the same as something we previously tried.”"

dwatt1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/berkeley/reviews/1332296,"“Berkeley is wild. Very intense, buzzing head high, with a kick of power. A very potent strain that will get you tripping real quick. But not a strain for new smokers as the paranoia is not a joke.”"
schiz0zen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/berkeley/reviews/1332297,"“I got some of this in Stockton, and it competes with chocolope for best sativa in my opinion.”"
jaywoodrow,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/berkeley/reviews/1384936,"“I tried the strain several times because I was given a half ounce of it from a grower friend. I found that it was really nice with alcohol and in a social environment – – but then I accidentally smoked it on a Sunday night before going to bed. The anxiety trip that I had was pretty epic. And I just read the note about it being anxious-dangerous after researching the strain...
That being said it's still very nice, but...”"

DeepThumb,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/berkeley/reviews/1300910,"“Great sativa high. Up tempo, very potent. Focused and energetic. Can't describe the flavor well although it's aroma is very loud. Fluffy and crisp.”"

Munin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/berkeley/reviews/1203527,"“Thought provoking, energetic, pleasant and a little warm in a hot cocoa on a cold day kind of way.  Flowery aroma with undertones of ammonia.  Smooth toke; voluminous.  Breath taking.”"
Polrber244,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/berkeley/reviews/1304106,"“Top notch frosty sativa. Can't go wrong if you like a very light citrus taste along with a nice uplifting, get up and do something type of effect. One of my favs. Not really for bedtime”"
ShakJarvis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/berkeley/reviews/1415281,"“Let me start this off by saying this strain tastes so refreshing I can't even describe it but if I could I would say it taste like water, just so pure, the flower is extra pretty, definitely one of my favorite strains I've been dying to get it again, it just made me happy, good for group gathering gets the creative juices running.”"

SkinnySkeleton,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/berkeley/reviews/1434796,"“Was not a fan at all. Made me very anxious and uncomfterlbe. My head was spinning and I couldn't stop looking for cops or something. Made everybody at the party tweak out a bit. Smoke with extreme caution and never baseball a rip of this stuff!”"
