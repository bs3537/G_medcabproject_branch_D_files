BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolate-skunk/reviews/1601871,"“I love Sativa's like this. You'd be hooked on this strain just from the taste. Chocolope's enough of a nice taste then adding skunk 1 makes it crazy unique.

Effects last a good 3 hours, crushes my fatigue and enhances my mood.”"
