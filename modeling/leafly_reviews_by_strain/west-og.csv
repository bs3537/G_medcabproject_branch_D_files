ChemicalGeorge,https://www.leafly.com/indica/west-og/reviews/1632315,"“So this strain hits smoooooth. The smell is woody, deep, herby and with your typical OG "smell". As I said, this strain his pretty smooth, and the exhale tastes pretty good too. I got a nice and deep body high too. I fell asleep pretty quick as well. Try this out!”"

Large buds, not very dense, not super sticky, feels dry. Once I get to my HP the high is awesome though, I'd recommend it, but definitely not my first choice.”"
