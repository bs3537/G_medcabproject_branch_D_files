Mastrom12,https://www.leafly.com/indica/big-bang/reviews/1373468,"“One of my favorite smelling and tasting buds. Very fruity smell like peaches and apples, accompanied by flowers like fresh blossoms with undertones of skunk.

Been smokin on the same old shit for a couple weeks now and I need a new taste." So, as any knowledgeable stoner does, I hopped onto leafly and looked over the menu.

Good flavor, friendly with throat it doesn't burn your throat at all.
