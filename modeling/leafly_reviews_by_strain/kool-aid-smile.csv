Definitely can note the cross-strain grapey undertones from Kool-aid Smile along with an earthy aroma of an incense like smell. Sweet tooth for sure, a pleasant couchsitting high. Goes well with cartoons or your fav show. Helped me relax my muscle tension easily.”"

It puts me in a nice happy relaxed mood. It doesn't make me stuck, I can still function with zero anxiety.”"
