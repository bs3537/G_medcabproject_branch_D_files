This is an uplifting, energetic, happy strain, plus it tastes amazing! I highly recommend this to anyone Sativa fans or Hybrid Sativa fans as you will not be displeased! Upon the first toke and taste I was like WTF this stuff is great, finished the bowl and was just spaced out feeling very good, the taste is just crazy....This is...”"

First time in 7 years I woke up today without a full blown anxiety attack. My eyes not hurting and no head ack Best day I've had in a long time.”"
AkaTeddd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1351848,"“Hard core Indica dominant strain.Friend brought over some flame couple months ago from Yilo superstore in Phoenix Az. Chem wreck is exactly that she will put you into the floor and keep you there.Effect feel like Purple kush hard core body. Great for a insomnia and extreme pain. Nighttime strain for sure.”"
KindGodess420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1251508,"“Disappointing.  Did not get high in head or body. Purchased at my go to spot, perhaps a bad grow, pass thank you....”"
Drewxke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1346806,"“Great taste and has a pine scent. Really nice high and not a sleeper strain. I feel blazed but able to perform duties.. Not bad on the dry mouth but you get it a little bit.. I recommend a try”"
JohnnySativa420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1346805,"“Great taste and light high. Great for back pain and arm pain as well.. I also  like it for chillaxing and slight energetic feels. Also some uplifting feels and goofiness. Haven't gotten any cotton mouth either, so that's amazing. I would say I have ten true strains I like, this is one.”"
Binggaty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1197834,"“This is my new favorite. It's everything you love about a diesel without the crazy cotton mouth.”"
EternalBloom,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1257381,"“Good high. Not so happy about the taste. Definitely an acquired taste. Looks amazing and makes you feel amazing”"
GettinHighSince95,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1346804,"“Good uplifting high. Happy and energetic.  Smells a bit piney and has a faint fuel taste. I will buy this strain again.”"
stzy420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1263740,"“Very potent strain. I opened the bag and all I could smell was a pungent smell sort of like skunk. The high was very uplifting and euphoric. Love this strain!”"
drew2887,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1234312,"“good strain if your looking too be able too function while enjoying a nice high on your day off of work”"
Cblaze316,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1240590,"“Was interested in the sweet combo of strains so picked it up in concentrate form. Had a nice almost kush /diesel flavor . Feel it could be a little better solvent less”"
BBKingSm00th,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1557479,"“Quick hitting hybrid that provides nice all around relaxation.  The indica creeps up on you though too many hits will put you to sleep.  Knocking 1 star off the rating because the dry mouth from this flower was very intense.”"
rachelf3997,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1776782,"“First of all, amazing potency, smell and taste. Soooo sticky 😍😍 I usually need to smoke 1.5 to 2 grams to get high but a 1 gram joint got me higher than I've been in a long time. But....

this strain made me overwhelmingly anxious, paranoid, and stressed... would not recommend for those of you that are looking for something to help those. Sativa high for about 10-20 minutes, then you'll definitely want to go to bed...”"
pjatscfy52,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1220332,"“Grade- B+

It's a nice effect, but after a brief period of energy and creativity, it quickly became a hazy couch lock.”"
AkaTeddd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1322673,"“ChemWreck will put you in to the floor like Buster did Tyson.Great for severe pain or insomnia.Friend brought some  in AZ.Pretty damn good did not take much but floored me not many strain's do maybe Purple Kush.
If you want to slay dragon's in your sleep this strain's for you!”"

highsam97,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1554038,"“Pungent, dense little popcorn nugs that'll kick your ass. Strong sativa hybrid, mine was 70/30 I think. Heavy head high, but you can feel a surprising amount of indica -- good for pain and relaxation while you work. I'm impressed with this strain, you can really feel the Trainwreck in it.”"
mitokes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemwreck/reviews/1271294,"“My favorite strain.  It gets me thinking thought to thought to thought but also a little giggly.  Just what we usually want on Saturday night.”"
