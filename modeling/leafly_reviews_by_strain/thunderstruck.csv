lunaeleven,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thunderstruck/reviews/1370657,"“This strain is just sooooo nice. Gives me a relaxed and tingly body high with really mild (almost none) psychoactive effects. I'm able to stay productive at work and feel totally stress the entire time. Really good strain for my anxiety and pain, I smoked a whole bowl and still felt really mild effects, but still such a smooth steady high. It also is really mild in smell, I feel like it doesn't make me reek at all. I...”"

I have been searching for a strain to relieve pain and severe back spasms without knocking me out for hours.  I started with several of the recommended CBD strains without much relief.  As I became a little braver with THC, I found this awesome Sativa pain reliever in the form of a Vape pen.  IT IS AMAZING!  I would love to find and vape the actual bud but This is now my go to.  I hav...”"

Nice big buds and very relaxing high. Dark green and tastes like Pine with a slight pepper taste. Helps my back pain A LOT. I'm really glad I found the seeds got this strain; it's even better for pain than the AC/DC Parents and more CBD. This should be in every medical cabinet.”"
allhoney82,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thunderstruck/reviews/1431182,"“This strain is amazing! The relaxation and tingling was immediate but my head remained clear. As another reviewer mentioned, this really should be in everyone's medicine cabinet.”"

JakeN45,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thunderstruck/reviews/1555879,"“This is the perfect strain for Anxiety, you feel really calm and relaxed with slight euphoria, in higher doses definitely felt the Sativa effects and more of the THC side of this strain. Didn’t have much cotton mouth if any. Love the sweet earthy taste it had.The cut that I had tested at 11% CBD and 6.6% THC just to show as a reference.”"

Veruca_Sugar,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thunderstruck/reviews/1779846,"“I take this in the SCCS oil form. I’m not exaggerating when I say this is personally the best mood stabilizer I’ve ever been on. I have PTSD, Bipolar II, BPD, and a few other issues. I’ve struggled for almost 20 years that would help. After consulting with an RN and a surprisingly short amount of trial and error, I figured out the best way to dose it and when. It took about a week to notice a decrease in panic and co...”"

VFatalis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/thunderstruck/reviews/1691131,"“I would have liked a stronger buzz.  The pain relief, however, is phenomenal.  Multiple old injuries are far less noticeable.  The description is spot on.”"
