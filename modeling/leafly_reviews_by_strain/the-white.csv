Unbelievably frosty sticky nugs, there are layers of trichomes after trichomes. The smell is a slight sour pine, nothing like trainwreck or jack herer and not very strong. There is a very strong taste to it, a taste that may cause beginners to choke. Even real smokers won't be able to hit as much as they usually do, the smoke expands in your lungs sign...”"

It was recommended to me at The Jazz Club looking for a strain to help with headaches and insomnia. It was their nicest looking strain so I couldn't resist, and it doesn't disappoint. What strikes me the most about The White is my absolute state of calm. With most strains this potent my anxiety disorder is triggered, but this is a purely mellow high with an almost opiate feel.

On that note, if you don't medicate often I would dose very lightly with this. This is the FLOYD MAYWEATHER of weed - KNOCKS me out into our Milky Way Galaxy, leaving me floating through the cosmos! More on the indica side, leaving you feeling relaxed and quite sleepy. Definitely one to watch a movie/documentary with.”"

Just for the record, I've been an almost daily cannabis user since 1973, and have had the good fortune to live in a region of the U.S.A. where the beginnings of the first seedless strains of marijuana, the "Sensi", were born.

"The White" is an awesome hybrid that does you right...if you give it a chance!  The smell doesn't hit you as much as opening a container of OG, but it smells hella dank nonetheless.
