Wonderful stay involved with low key social settings or a nice day to take your time and enjoy the world around you peacefully. Love this one and love that I picked up 1/8 for 20! Definitely. It energizing but very comfortable peaceful smiley high.”"
LeafFourTwenty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/summer-breeze/reviews/1682649,"“A euphoric strain, with a mellow onset and a slow offset that fades quietly. It has a very nice flavor which does remind me of a wonderful summer day. Very head-focused with a soft body high, I would recommend this to someone who prefers sativas that won’t knock them out.”"

Does feel a bit balanced between indica and sativa, maybe 60 40 but I’m sure that’s the terps causing that. Definitely worth a try if you get your hands on some. Not a great one for sleep unless you smoke a lot of it lol.”"
