Nice strain, very heady at first, eurphoric and for a sativa, surprisingly worked on aches and pains in the body.  Functional but I wouldn't drive the entire day you are consuming.  Reminds me a lot of WhiteWidow because you have a buzz on for HOURS after the initial 2 hour euphoria stage.
I like strains that last for a couple hours and taper off pretty fast with no "I've ...”"

Schismatron,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/buffalo-bill/reviews/1299451,"“Nice and relaxed high, with some functional stoniness. Very giggly and happy with no paranoia or nervousness.”"
Whitefall,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/buffalo-bill/reviews/1299757,"“This strain surprised me.  I purchased because I like the freely roaming mind.  This amped up my imagination greatly, and in a good way.  But I don't tend to have any bad reactions to MJ (thank goodness).

My entire body tingled and I had some of the best sex *ever*.  This will become a staple in our household for sure!”"

Classic sativa strain: happy, euphoric, chatty

I noticed no increase in appetite or real "Stoney" feeling which helped me stay focused on continuing to get work done on my small business that evening. 

Great flavor profile: noticed more of the woodsy tastes first with a subtle tropical finish 

Very nice.”"

Immediately got a happy, euphoric, and tingly head high. The body high crept up on me. Even though it was relaxing, I felt Buffalo Bill was functional. Great for some daytime pain relief. It was pretty uplifting. So, was good for depression too. Doc and Yeti grew this amazingly crystalized, and tasty cr...”"

The main problem I had with this strain was that it was annoyingly heady and after the main rush came on, felt like a cat had crawled on my head and refused to leave.  Very annoying and very long lasting head high.  Think hours and hours.  Not my idea of fun but it may be for you.”"
