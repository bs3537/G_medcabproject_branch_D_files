The buds are dark green in colour with a lovely orange hairs wrapped around, she has a very distinct berry and woodsy type of flavour. This strain was different just due to it being an indica hybrid it had me feeling very happy and talk...”"

I don't know what an elderberry tastes like but this sweet and pungent strain hits your lips you'll feel relaxation and relief rush over you. The exhale has an earthy skunk flavor to it. It smells better than it tastes in my opinion but it's a good before bed smoke as it makes me very tired very quickly”"

After toking had an instant surge in energy and my brain was racing with to do list items. But it put me in a place where if you want to take a nap you can or if you want to go the gym you can. Pain relief took a little longer to roll in. It worked great for my period cramps and my foot pain ( 5 screws from a shattered heel, I use shatter to heal it now ). Very effe...”"

malisp,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1397262,"“As someone who has suffered from insomnia for over 20 years (and tried every treatment possible during those years, none of which helped), this strain is the best I've found for helping me get to sleep!”"
hkh5,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1302648,"“heavy indica effect that is perfect for insomnia. high is smooth, relaxing, and long-lasting. however, it does cause me to wake up with munchies...but I think the sleep/relaxation benefits are worth it.”"

bassanova,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1414611,"“This may differ from a lot of patients on here. But I love this strain because in whatever a light dose is for you,  you can get great indica reliefs like Pain, stress, and headaches, and sort of starts out like an indica but rides out toward the end like sativa not leaving ready to lay down.”"
Sna421,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1531012,"“Amazing smell.  Full body relaxation.  Nice mellow high but the munchies were strong with this one!”"
carterkush092,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1497769,"“I’m liking this strain more and more each time I smoke it! The nugs are a gorgeous light green color with orange hairs running through them and hints of purple scattered throughout. They glisten in the light from the amount of trichomes on each bud! The taste is a mix of berry and grape with subtle earthy aftertaste. Very relaxing body high. Overall a great strain.”"
alicat21,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1535379,"“horrible! I tried this strain a few times from different places and each time it gave me an extreme headache.”"
Ryno602,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1337256,"“I love this Kush it reminds me of a forest both in looks and taste. Very earthy not very impressive to look at but hits right away with pain relief and is great for anyone with stomach issues i.e. pain/lack of appetite. Perfect style of bud for making shatter. 🌵”"
KbAz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1292302,"“Very nice. Dabbed some shatter and it was delicious. Cerebral and uplifting while simultaneously offering a euphoric body high. Great for depression, anxiety and pain relief.”"
rysterman34,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1275285,"“This strain is extremely soothing. Sort of felt like a nice relaxing wave coming over me. Made me want to sleep but also helped minimize anxiety and pain.”"

Ryno602,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1297680,"“Very clean shatter with zero bubbles, thick smoke (not harsh) and a no poopy soupy it actually crackles when you pop a snap. 🌵”"
AHizzle,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1251530,"“Elderberry Kush has a smooth sweetness on the inhale combined with a skunky and earthy Kush typical exhale. The relaxing effects are very quick to set in and can easily cause you to become sleepy. Great for cheering up and pain relief as well this strain makes a great choice for many patients.”"

The high was super smooth melting all worries away lol I really enjoyed this flower”"
dylanc123,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1346010,"“This was a very nice strain. It mildly set in after a few bong rips and pretty soon I was in a greater state of mind. It was a nice social smoke, surprising for a heavy indica. When I say social I mean talkative. Very effective pain reliever and it gives a pleasant tingle throughout your body that will put you to sleep if you get too comfy”"
greenRegan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1309213,"“Very tasty. Super tasty really good for anxiety and stress.”"
Ryno602,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1323885,"“The shatter is very dark which is common for this strain but it also tastes a bit burnt, which sucks bong water,  the high is pretty potent so I'm not pissed but I'm also not thrilled with the batch. 🌵”"
jamieleet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/elderberry-kush/reviews/1313906,"“This strain is very weak and I honestly don't see how it helps with anxiety. I feel that, and it could possibly be just because I'm thinking about it, but I have a little more anxiety after smoking than I did before. Definitely will stay away from this bud.”"
