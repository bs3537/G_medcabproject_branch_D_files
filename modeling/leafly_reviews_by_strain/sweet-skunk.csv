Taste is chemically sweet. Joints smoke from sweet on a dry hit eventually turning sweet and sour towards the end.
Frisbee weed for sure.”"

Amazing sweet citrus smell of the bud the smoke flavour i notice tends to be a sweet earthy taste to me would recommend!!!!”"

Within a few days the buds began to basically resemble shake. Also, doesn't get you too high (coming from a regular smoker). To top it off, this dispensary had a cheaper ounce (Fast Eddi) which was superior to Sweet skunk.”"
