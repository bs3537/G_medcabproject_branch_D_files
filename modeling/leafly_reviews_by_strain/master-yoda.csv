Had this as a nug run shatter and the effects were unbelievable. This strain is literally the best about both of its parent strains.

It's an awesome, but manageable head rush, it's incredibly calming, gets you laughing, and is a CREEPER! About 15 minutes in, it felt like my blanket melted on top of me and I couldn't stop giggling and wiggling around in it like a little noodle 🍝

TheWizardOz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/master-yoda/reviews/1232807,"“Stumbled on this strain before going to see Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Was hesitant to dish out the cash for it, as it was a bit pricer than average, but glad I did. At this point, it may be my all-time favorite strain. A smooth mellow high that relaxes you without knocking you out. Everyone that got a taste loved it. Just wish more of it was available in my area.”"
premiumbliss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/master-yoda/reviews/1305342,"“Master Yoda is a super chill sativa hybrid. I smoked the wax by Heavenly Buds, which by the way 20/gram at New Vansterdam in Aberdeen, WA is a total steal. This is a high quality mellow buzz, the first few times it did make me sleep like a baby, so it's perfect for a night cap, but it doesnt drag you down like an indica would. Have a few puffs with your morning coffee and youre set to go. It's a clearheaded high with...”"

mraz1217,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/master-yoda/reviews/1355683,"“Oh my God! this is quite possibly one of my new favorites. the initial drag after its lit is a combination of a woody, very fibrous- with a very very sweet flavor. But when it hits, and- oh does it hit, you feel a warm tingle calm through your body. The light cerebral buzz helps to calm the mind after a hard or stressful situation. This combined with the body effects make this strain a good go-to if you're looking fo...”"

BUT-as far as the smoke goes, I swear it tasted like where Yoda lives. Really earthy and green. The high though...I feel like I went through Jedi training, and I will not be a Jedi Master until I can master how strong the force is in this weed.”"

cd1990,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/master-yoda/reviews/1328677,"“The force truly is strong with this one. 

The sativa/indica balance is almost perfect. Once you smoke this pure, earthy,  grass, your bong will fill with crystal white smoke, and you will inhale without any cough or irritation.

The high will soon follow and lasts for a very long time. 

It smells like shit though. So make sure you mask that dank. 

This is my 2nd favorite strain, only behind Chem Scout.”"

sviauz06,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/master-yoda/reviews/1327218,"“More of an "Earthier" tasting kush than what I'm used to. Didn't have any sort of sweetness too it ( In the batch i got ). Strong soil/wet wood smell to it, made me interested as to how it would taste. Was dried really well, but it crackled as it burned. Other than the crackling it was a good smoke. Had a typical Indica stone, but not as heavy. Good early evening strain in my opinion.”"
