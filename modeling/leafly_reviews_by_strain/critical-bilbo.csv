metalgoat420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1417273,"“Whoa, this strain had me feeling like Bilbo Baggins chilling with Gandolf getting heavily medicated. I'll call this one "my precious".”"
cherrypoppins,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1357345,"“amazing head high to start you off as you feel a sweet humming in your bones and joints. sweet laughter filled my head resulting in a huge dorky grin.  now I feel like I'm floating above my bed just enjoying the waves of solitude . amazing.  no more pain. no more sadness. just sweet life.”"
laurastella,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1353683,"“Smoked 1 joint and was done for the night. Makes you laugh like hell.”"
TheBatrix,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1248306,"“Es brutal, gracias a ella ligue con 3 tias, la sensación me gustó mucho! Voy a repetir”"

MRe90,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1177196,"“Through years of research I have found Bilbo is one best hangover cures known to man”"
Milwo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1375873,"“A very heavy, narcotic, hard-hitting flower. First time got me totally wasted on 0,5g, smoked from a joint, and I am no beginner. You are likely to have some visuals with this. My absolute favourite bedtime bud. A fat J and I've got about two hours of serenity before bedtime. Difficult to score in my neck of the wood, but totally worth looking for.”"
blasetu,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1289065,"“really good weed, good taste and  perfect to have a chill out time, the music sounds much better believe me  hahahahaha”"

cban,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1306178,"“Probably my favorite bud I have tried to date. The euphoric properties are through the roof and is a great bud to chill with friends and share a few laughs. The more you used it, the more you laughed it seemed. It will leave a noticeable look on your face as you burn out. Great bud to use when hanging with a few buddies.”"
rugitu00,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1381296,"“Esta maria es una pasada sin duda una de las mejores. La califico de 10, i la catalogo entre una de las que peovar una experiencia casi unica.”"
SanaSeppo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1725787,"“Took a decent raw hit from the bong. It sinks into your body and you can feel the sativa & indica sides of energies clashing through each other in your body. One wants to take you up and the other one down! Psychedelic! The upward rush lasted for 30min and settled for a balanced bodybuzz + awareness. Even though it didnt take away my nerve pain it helped to cope with it. Would recommend to anyone who likes Indica!”"
anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1356018,"“Great strain!!! Very strong Mental high!!! It's not for beginners. Great smell and taste.”"
jasepr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1356056,"“Intense cerebral high with only two puffs. Social and talkative but sometimes difficult to continue an argument. One has to be careful with this strain because it can lead to a badtrip with not so funny ideas in the mind. It can dissociate the sense of reality.”"

Musgo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1300604,"“Really powerful effect, if you want to be really stoned and chill is the one to choose. Had a very nice smell and taste for me. I loved it but it can be too indica sometimes”"

samisin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1436631,"“I concure with the Bilbo Baggins statement. I feel like I am floating on this bud. Once did edibles and ate too much (of course), and I was detached, flying and floating. Strong.”"
recogemoras,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1317828,"“Really awesome for anxiety and pain. It left me really relaxed and content, and a bit couchpotatoed/sleepy after 25 minutes vaping, but if you feel really anxious 10 minutes (vape) is enough and you don't get sleepy or anything.
Great for relaxing before going to sleep or when feeling anxious.”"

Bektor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1234937,"“This strain is awesome, in most cases you get head-high really fast, and then the euphoria and happiness start comming out, I totaly recomend this strain”"
BeZerkaveli,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1246693,"“I like this stuff, but it burns you out probably faster than any weed I've ever smoke. Very potent, but almost to the point smoking it is pointless when you can't feel it. Very pretty bud visually. Smells strong.”"
jackback,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1163155,"“Perhaps the best thing that I smoked in the last few years!”"

annathetoker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1227542,"“This strain starts with a smooth head high that hits you fast. The high doesn't last so long if you don't keep smoking. 1 bowl of this and I'm still able to be active and go on with my daily chores. Packed a bowl and went on a walk with my dog just enjoying nature at it's finest. Works great for night time and before bed, you just gotta smoke a couple of bowls.”"

ZionLast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1301521,"“One of The finest hybrids I've smoked for a long time. fluffy buds that swells up nice when grinded. The smell is sharp, sweet and fruity. Hits hard both in bodyhigh and headhigh quite fast. I would go so far as saying this one is for the seasoned smoked Only. Great for pain and plain boredom;)”"
Camiloart,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1455312,"“marihuana muito comum na españa. Um otimo sabor e cheiro muito agradavel, tenha em conta que depois de fumar uma critical nao vai fazer mais nada em seguida pq essa erva te coloca muito relaxado.”"

MarcoMgrown,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1067829,"“One of my favourites. Easy & fast grow strain. The high is insane, sometimes too narcotic, gets you so wasted. Nice yields, the flavour is earthy, skunky, fruity like inmature fruit. A must try strain. Originaly selected in Bilbao, vasque country. Spread in cut form, easy to find near barcelona.”"
Dominator1709,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1182697,"“It had been a while since i had smoked an indica dominant hybred like this and it knocked me for six.

Felt totally relaxed , happy and practically paralysed (In a good way).

At first couldn't  pin point the taste but very reflective of a good Critical mass but with a slightly sweeter and ammonia taste”"

alex7aji,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/critical-bilbo/reviews/1248342,"“One of the best strains that I tried, makes your eyes so red, makes your mind creative and your body so relaxed at the same time.

Yes, fatigue is enviable, but I was fighting counting sheep more than I was enjoying the high. I did notice it had sort of a mixed berry scent to it.”"
