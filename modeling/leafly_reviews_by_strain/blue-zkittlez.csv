Blue Zkittlez

rainbowcrash,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-zkittlez/reviews/1460026,"“I first came across Blue Zkittlez at the Barbary Coast collective in San Francisco and holy crap, this strain knocked my socks off from first sniff. 
It smells like a bag of skittles. 
It ground up well, and smokes smooth in joints or in a bong. 
When you start grinding, the smell is even more powerful. Nothing short of a negative-pressure environment is keeping this smell in. 
The taste is reminiscent of berries and...”"

LemonPastry,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-zkittlez/reviews/1517559,"“Quite honestly, Blue Zkittlez does not give me a deep indica vibe. I feel a little bit slower, relaxed for sure, but it gives me a little kick to want to be productive and do something. It's effects creep up on you and hit you hard, and it gets me really giggly and social - something I need a little more of out of life. Once it starts to come down is when I feel sleepy, but only if I sit myself down or lay in my comf...”"

firemonkeyfarms,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-zkittlez/reviews/1481686,"“An indica that smokes like a sativa without the paranoia. Sweet, fruity smoke that lifts you. A functional high follows that inspires and sparks  creativity, Great for social events.”"
ProdBlackJack,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-zkittlez/reviews/1664854,"“Currently smoking Blue Zkittlez grown in Cali.  Its my new favorite Indica strain, doesn't make me very tired but yet it relaxes me a great deal. Its the definition of mellowing out and just being positive.”"
aubreylee91,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-zkittlez/reviews/1546912,"“This tastes just like the name. The aftertaste will definitely remind you of skittles, it’s amazing. It’s very smooth and full of flavor. Like a few others have said, this one has more of a sativa affect on me and I feel pretty productive. Yesterday, I went on a decent hike and I smoked this most of the way. When finished, after stretching and resting I felt amazing with a good buzz. I was relaxed, refreshed and happ...”"

This is literally the perfect strain for people looking to come home after a long day and blaze and just sit back grab some food and just chill. 

I wouldn’t recommend smoking a lot of this one before having to get a lot of things done because it will might slow you down. 

Overall I really enjoyed this one and would probably ...”"

I have an immensely high tolerance, and one bowl from my bong was a hard horse-kick to the face. I had my eyes watering heavily, unable to open them for a while, riding through waves of bliss. This one is super relaxing and gives immediate stress-relief. I'm currently getting totally absorbed into...”"

Amazing aroma, curing perfecto, and a smoke that brought to mind classic strains from the ‘80s mixed with a candy bowl.  Will have you looking for the real candy bowl too.  5 Stars.”"

So pleasant and then to compliment it with the taste! Some of the best tasting stuff I have ever smoked on. It creeped up on me but when it hit, IT HIT! This was some top shelf green and If you have a chance, definitely get some of this. Some of the finer green I have had.”"

Can't notice the aroma or flavor probably because there's always that extra tar flavor that comes with pre-rolls. Body high came on pretty quick which is nice. Great for beating the morning depressions which is surprising for an indica. Did some yoga. Now I want to eat everything in the world foreve...”"

friendlydog420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-zkittlez/reviews/1574820,"“This was a pleasure for sure, super high grade indica strain. The high had a creative buzz that alot of indicas cant bring. Def some good herb to relax the anxieties, good for low key creative activities.”"
shanethekitty,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-zkittlez/reviews/1477102,"“Got this from CHAI in Santa Cruz, CA. It literally knocked me off my feet. It smelled good it was sticky and easy to pack. It gave you the cerebral feeling pretty quickly, but not aggressively. It balanced the high effect with soothing and relaxing effects. It also didn't give me dry mouth which was magical. Definitely one of my new favorites!”"

markshah,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-zkittlez/reviews/1657812,"“it is an indica dominant strain. blue zkittlez starts off by reducing my anxiety and helping me think more clearly, then mellow calming effects in all aspects. I usually end up smoking another bowl/joint of this strain, because it tastes good and the effects are mellow and very pleasant. while it lacks in getting me to where I need to be off 1 joint, it makes up for in terpene profile and quality of flower. it is ver...”"

It’s great for after work to relax, it also doesn’t make me paranoid, anxious or have that racing heart effect, you’ll also have the best sleep once you get comfy and it starts to wear off. I highly recommend this strain.”"

cretin71,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-zkittlez/reviews/1604324,"“This stuff really does smell like Skittles candy, and though the taste is sweet, it’s more floral and berry-like than candy flavored.

The high comes
on fast, with both a strong body and mental high.  In fact, the head high verged on racy and anxious, though not quite to the point of unpleasantness. A lot of mental energy that was accompanied by strong relaxation to the back, legs and chest.  After about 15 minutes, ...”"

The buds are freaking huge nuggests and it breaks down really nice to give you a nice fat joint. 

As you start to smoke it doesn’t seem more of an indica dominant strain more of a sativa because of the light and relaxing feel but boy does this shit come down on you after a good 10-15 drags. Definitely sedating in effect and ...”"
