Whether or not these rumours are true, there is no doubt that this is one of the strongest strains available today with very high levels of THC and buds glistening with resin. This hybrid of G13 has been...”"

I seldom use anything except before bed, but this strain was great.  Kept me mentally focused, but relaxed...then turned into a great body pain reliever.  I could also not believe how long the effects lasted!  Now my one and only Hybrid that I will use again.”"

Dutch weed is usually stronger than foreign weed, and I had been informed that this was high quality marijuana. After smoking it, I felt awesome. It felt as if I was flying, and everytime I moved, I felt as if I was being electrocuted, but in a nice way. My body felt completely relaxed, b...”"

Fast onset that starts in the head followed by a nice body numbing feeling. I believe this could help treat almost anything with related to pain. 

I could see this strain being overwhelming for beginners or those who smoke too much of this strain. I vaped a little ...”"
