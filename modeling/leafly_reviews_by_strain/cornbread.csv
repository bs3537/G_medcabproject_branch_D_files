Serious lemon smell to it with a background of other sweet smells I assume is the "incense" they speak of, great strain for after work and stress management/anxiety in small doses, higher doses can cause seriou...”"

damnnnnnnnnnn.  I ate a can of pringles, bag of carmel crisps, bowl of golden crisps cereal, and later had an ice cream cone.   I suffer with Lupus SLE and sometimes the hardest thing is eating.  I've been looking for something like this for a very long time.

dixiedude,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cornbread/reviews/1374955,"“Just an FYI that  this one is very  strong smelling in bud form. If you are trying to be discrete you will want an air tight container. Great smell and smoke however.”"
Outlawkitties,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cornbread/reviews/1391863,"“This is a wonderful strain. It is nice and mellow tasting of lime. Watch out on this one though. Gives you a nice mellow high with lots of pain relief without the heavy sedation feeling, but don't lay down! Layed down for a second and woke up the next morning!”"
NatashaDolby,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cornbread/reviews/1358142,"“One of the best Indica's I've ever had. It was very sedating, relaxing, with bad couch-lock. I would say to only use this at night. A lot of friends that have tried it said it knocked them out so be careful. If you have it in your area, get it. Its an amazing Indica.”"
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cornbread/reviews/1417924,"“Didn't think much was happening, until....Whoa!...I'm not that experienced with pure indicas, so it was a different kind of high for me.  Really liked it.  I can see getting into indica dom more and more.  This one was super relaxing but you can easily get up and function....just a nice, mellow stone.”"
alexham,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cornbread/reviews/1394393,"“This strain got me tripping balls. My and friend and I tried this stuff and we lost snippets in time, it was really unlike anything I had ever tried before. And the cotton mouth u get, oh god, better have a drink handy because this strain honours its name completely. The effects are very sedative, and slowly creep up on you. Would recommend to experienced stoners, definitely not a strain to try on your first time.”"

After 2 bong rips i could tell this had bubba kush in it. Body high to the extreme. Very relaxing. Not to the point I was sleepy. I was able to watch a couple shows and munch out. This strain gave me the munchies badly! Great strain.”"
mtchyg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cornbread/reviews/1358143,"“This is a great strain. It relaxes me. I had one of the most deep and emotional (in a good way) talks with my wife last night after imbibing. The only thing is... it seems to act more like a Sativa for us. It is very rare for me to fall asleep faster while high. My wife on the other hand is the exact opposite of me. She sleeps very easily and quickly after smoking. Well, if this strain has kept her up for longer than...”"
cannibus365,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cornbread/reviews/1330553,"“yes. Solid Indica with a body high that penetrates like gamma rays yet u are still functional. A strong strain for the evening or off time. Definitely therapeutic for the body and mind but watch ur back because it's a potent indica.”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cornbread/reviews/1594416,"“I've been seeing Cornbread around the dispensaries lately and my interest was piqued... asked the budtender about it, she said "heavy indica, define couch lock." Funny thing is, it doesn't give me couch lock at all. It's relaxing, makes me happy, and it makes me get very into whatever I'm doing/watching/taking about. Maybe it's just because it makes me feel so pain and stress free, but I remained alert and attentive ...”"
NoahNoArk,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cornbread/reviews/1285939,"“One of my new favorite indicas,the buds were fluffy, colorful and gave off an aroma that almost made your stomach growl, like someone was preparing food in the kitchen it smelt so good. Smooth smoke and a great taste. And a great keif yield when I tossed in my grinder. Definitely in my new top 5 favorite strains”"

Opened the jar and took my first smell, definitely not what I smelled at Reef or ever before. This flower smelled like a wet towel that sat on the floor in a boys locker room for a month. Threw a little in a V2 and sat back to enjoy a smooth inhale and cornbread taste upon exhale. Very functional high, totally forgot about all my worries and p...”"

(respectively.) fantastic.”"

RWright,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cornbread/reviews/1387491,"“4.5 Nice looking bud, smells a bit like Bubba Kush.  Not a real heavy head high but the rest of the expected indica effects are definitely there working overtime.   I experienced good results with pain, anxiety, nausea and depression.  Nice for the lazy boy and a movie.

Would buy again (26 pct)”"

If you get it in flower form, you’re in for a treat. It’s got a pungent scent and a savory flavor, and the flower had lovely purple notes. Highly recommended!”"
bezae,https://www.leafly.com/indica/cornbread/reviews/1378974,"“This is my new favorite strain to smoke. Corn Bread isn't rated as a strain that brings out euphoria, but that is its major effect on me. Not only does it relax me, it brings out my sillies. That makes it the perfect companion for late night standup specials on Netflix or comedy podcasts. Try listening to Tom Segura after some corn bread. I doubt you'll regret it.”"

I am finding I only need to consume as half as much as I normally would. Amazing looking/smelling buds and it was in the "budget" section of my local dispensary($5.75g). I will be purchasing this one again for sure!”"

And 2 it was rolled in a joint!  Am returning tomorrow!
Maybe I got one that slipped through!  Anyway I give it a THUMBS DOWN!!”"
