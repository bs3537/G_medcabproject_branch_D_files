Great physical effect, all pain and stress melt away quickly but still functional for conversation or activity. Smoke anytime, long lasting but not heavy or overpowering. One of the best I've tried.”"
Granfandan747,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mega-jackpot/reviews/1467846,"“love this super hydrid and all its phenotypes are delicious and fantastic. 

Great daytime smoke for seasoned and new smokers.

Some of it takes after Silver Haze others Northern Lights and some Jack Herer.

Amazing flavors and buzzes.

highly recommend this strain for everyone.”"
BigNasty420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mega-jackpot/reviews/1412395,"“Good flavor, good smoke.  I would say this strain is mood and head space dependent, or it is at least for me. 
I will need to revisit this strain when I am feeling more up beat and not as dark. 
If I am not in the good upbeat mood I get a wee bit dark and brooding with this strain.”"
Justmoshker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mega-jackpot/reviews/1463444,"“Combines two of my favorite highs together into a deliciously cerebral but in touch with my body kind of high. Great for me for visiting, deeper intimacy, running errands, or other functional activities (as long as I don't get too high!). Yes, I know the punctuation for the last sentence is completely wrong, but I like it.”"
AinWA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mega-jackpot/reviews/1412390,"“Very strong!  One of those "one hit" strains - one decent toke and you are good to go.  Unique vanilla flavor upon exhale.  Energizing and good for productivity.”"

J’ai la maladie de Crohn et le MJP aide énormément pour mes douleurs, après 3 puff toute douleurs abdominales et naussées s’estompe fortement me laissant avoir une qualité de vie normale. 

De plus, il sent bon, il goûte bon avec un Euphorique et paisible buzz !”"
Skyhon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mega-jackpot/reviews/1665890,"“It was good for just hanging out and talking. My friend has a very low tolerance and threw up about an hour in after two hits in a row. Seeing that usually would have me in a dark space, mentally, but it didn’t go there with this strain.
Now, this might be a coincidence (I only smoked it once because of this) but my throat the day after was absolutely destroyed. I’m talking as bad or worse than the last dregs of a co...”"
