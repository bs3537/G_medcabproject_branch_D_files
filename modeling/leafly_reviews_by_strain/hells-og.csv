Hell's OG
=============
FoxPilot,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hells-og/reviews/1392527,"“This is my favorite sleepy time strain. Do NOT read that to mean it is ONLY good for sleeping. I enjoy it pretty much any time. But it turns my brain off and lets me relax. Let me explain that a little better...it turns off the constantly thinking, logical part of my brain (frontal lobe?) that keeps me awake all night because it won't shut the f up, and activates the creative parts of my brain (temporal lobes?) so I ...”"
lemonmerrengue,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hells-og/reviews/1370176,"“Great taste and very stoney. Has long lasting effects with pain numbing, and relaxation, but might be a bit strong on the mind for some with low tolerances. I smoked it mid day and was able to function well, others may want to leave this as a night time strain unless pain and anxiety relief are needed.”"
OKushoma,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hells-og/reviews/1351614,"“To sum this strain up in one word is almost impossible, but all I can say is "Wow".  It is a bit psychedelic for the first 30 minutes or so, but quickly relieves the pain from a 12 year old back injury.  Pungent is an understatement for it's aroma.  One big hit from a pipe or bong almost instantly fills 1200 sq ft of space with penetrating stench that I have not smelled the likes of in at least a decade (30 year+ smo...”"

JustinKCHC,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hells-og/reviews/1410882,"“Here in Arizona it's known as Biker OG. Super fruity indica that had helped me with chronic headaches and relaxation.

clumatikush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hells-og/reviews/1390462,"“This strain is one of the most potent i have had. THC reaches about 30% which is great for almost any pain or condition you have, or if you're looking for a strain that will ease the mind. This strain has an earthy aroma with candy like undertones. The strain was said to be bred in Southern California by Bikers, but no one knows for sure. It a takes 5-10 minutes when smoked or vaporized for effects to kick in. Feelin...”"

Hell's Angel has a wonderful full body buzz that really does wonders on pain. I smoke often and didn't find it as heavy as much as relaxing. I have anxiety issues and gotta say, it was super cool to see how calm it made me and I could still function without feeling like I wanted to veg out...”"

It has a thick dense smoke that makes your upper chest expand into a cough if you draw to deep, which is easy to do, due to it's smooth syrupy entrance. the head is immediate and strong, and comes over the eyes and warms your face.

They must have developed this strain to ease their bones after 1000 jarring miles on a Harley and to come down from the crank. This stuff has me paralyzed, in a good way.”"

Add notes of skunk and pine and that's what this tastes like.

Very potent high that lasts a good long while. If this isn't my favorite strain rn, then I would probably crown Super Silver Haze. Both are excellent strains.”"
