Probably the strongest citrus smell I have ever encountered with any strain. I like this more than Tangie, Kosher Tangie and Sour Diesel. The high is the right kind of sativa balance I love. Whoever decided to bring these strains together, I commend thee. I would recommend it over any other 80%+ sativa.”"

xfactorglory,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-tangie/reviews/1333096,"“Super awesome! I like to take a few bong rips of this in the morning because it wakes me up better than coffee and leaves me energized. I did build up immunity to this pretty fast but it's definitely a hard hitter the first time. Smells and tastes pretty good, very citrusy. I'll absolutely be buying this again.”"

Normally this would not have been a bad thing but I had just gotten to work so all I could do was send my boyfriend nasty text all day. This stuff had me saying things so good, I had us both worked up. I'm sure you can imagine the night we had once I got off and smoked the rest with him. Love it...”"

It looks and tastes much more like sour diesel, and that isn't a bad thing at all.  much happier, stress melts away, allowing some focus to set in and code starts flowing out to the screen.

The taste is the best because it makes your whole mouth taste citrusy with a long lasting aftertaste. My fingers reeked of the smell also so be warned of its pungency. The bud was really dense and extremely crystallized, just like I like em. This resulted in bowls that smoked for a long time which I prefer. Wouldn't recomme...”"

However tiredness and drowsiness wasn't an issue with this strain and it helped with my painting. So it did mellow me out, but didn't put me to sleep.
