Locktite
=============
hjointsmoke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1396325,"“This is a pretty strong bud, good upbeat and sense of well being. Found it to be good anytime day or night, helps with pain and a lack of appetite while still providing a social, cerebral buzz. Can def make you want to lay down after a while, other than that it isnt a lazy bud at all. Good medicine all around, cant find much to complain about. Solid A”"
raisinbran,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1410077,"“Locktite is surprising; sometimes it hits hard, sometimes it’s a smoother ride. A dense, brown bud, when it’s on it's on. Smoking Locktite seems to provide a much more heady experience than vaping, which is decidedly mellower. When smoked, Locktite has been known to provide an equally stoned and upbeat experience- sometimes producing pleasant bouts of euphoria after extended periods of lethargy. Some strains are just...”"
CaptBasch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1410075,"“I tried a bit of this one night and I have to say I've never laughed so hard on YouTube in my life. Cow Chop made me lose my shit on this strain. However it did make me very anxious when I went outside so I recommend staying in your own home.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1359803,"“Very head high. I do love the gorilla glue strains, I've never had the pleasure of smoking the other parent Mt
 Rainier but ugh I just love it. Diesel aroma, I picked up Locktite budder tonight because I remember how bomb the flower was from almost a year ago.  This is in my top 5 hybrids.”"
PuddinOne,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1410076,"“Nice nighttime high for me. It might make some more sensitive to getting jacked up on sativa strains a little restless for a nighttime smoke.  One word relaxed!”"
KSkwared,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1410078,"“Was hoping for a stronger couch lock effect, but it did mellow me out and relieve the pain.”"
Hookakat1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1416026,"“While the genetics of this strain includes Gorilla Glue #4 it seems to have a bit more of a sativa-ish effect versus the heavy indica effect I've always gotten from Gorilla Glue #4. It's a more clear headed, energetic buzz than GG#4 but it has a very upbeat buzz to it. If you're looking to enjoy your activity this would be a good choice imo. If you're looking to really sit down and feel your buzz though maybe stick w...”"
kiahuna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1364892,"“This strain differs greatly from GG4 for me in that I feel a little zombie like if I overdo it. Great for nighttime just before going to bed.  Boom boom, 
out go the lights!”"
JorgeCT420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1394042,"“Great daytime strain. Not lethargic at all and has a very pleasant cerebral buzz. Great citrus and diesel taste throughout. Highly recommended 👀”"
MasterMindLabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1241741,"“Wow that LocktiteF1 surprised us!...one of the dankest GG#4 crosses out there!!!”"
skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1483575,"“Locktite is my new favorite nighttime strain... its effect is a less heady, more body melty GG#4 and it is heavenly. My ladyfriend and I were driving home tonight after a very long day... I said I had a Locktite joint waiting for us and she said "yesssss let's get melty." It's not heavy, it's not trippy, it just relaxes everything and floats your mind away. Smells and tastes a lot like GG#4 and hits immediately. Defi...”"
goldcountrygreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1331961,"“One of my favorites.  It relieves my pain and puts in a great mood without knocking me out.  I definitely want to keep this stocked up.”"

I was already tired so smoking some I was given from trimming last night, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. after almost three years of being a patient this was one of the few that compliments me managing brain damage, and keeping me head high on the trip home off just a bowl. it eases you gently into a relaxed, focused, clear headed/ happy high, that still helps physically as well so my run...”"
Sayumm69,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1253083,"“This strain is fantastic for anyone who cant calm down after a full day of work. As someone with gastic ulcers, it can be a little rough on my "heart burn" from time to time but I'm sure that just my reaction. Also you'll want a bottle of water or tea because the dry mouth is strong with this one.”"

gregs01,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1237426,"“Super light green buds in part due to the absolutley crazy trichome coverage on this sweet lookin specimen, light brown hairs, this batch was manicured quite well. Smells pungent, Slight pine scent, great all day smoke it's my go to for this week without a doubt and will definitely be grabbing some more, as I suggest you do if available.”"

420ranger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1451934,"“I love the smell of it and the fact that is smells like gorilla glue which is one of my prefered strains. I also love how the aroma is sweet with pungent undertones and the taste is very earthy and yet somehow sweet and deceptively smooth.”"

chroniccannabisconsumsr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1258187,"“This is an awesome strain. It gives you the incredible chocolatey, chemmy taste profile of the gorilla glue, with undertones of pine near toward the tip of the tongue. The original gg4 is pretty inebriating on its own, but this is a little watered down, it wont turn you into a complete zombie. Great for pain and sleeping. This is some very high quality flower, but it is not the same quality as the GG#4.”"

707jmelynch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1448077,"“Overall it's a nice strain, very strong. It does have some stretch to it when you put in flower. Yields are good, has above average tricombs production for sure. Has a nice lime smell when cured 3+ weeks.”"

NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1261808,"“If you like gorilla glue then you'll like this it has gorilla glue flavor the earthy pungent almost diesel notes but with a bright citrus pine finish.

It starts out upbeat then kinda gets more and more relaxing as time goes by so to smoke this all day...”"
BigBobbyBillionaire,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1355162,"“Very very good strain when properly grown or when it's at least the real strain ... the origins are really unknown I've seen true locktite that had no cross of gg#4.. it was more of a OceanGrown origin .. I can remember this strain or possibly it's parent or sister strain back in the 90s and it's was Serious Serious FIRE.. it was much heavier but smelled Exactly the same tasted exactly the same .. but it was 95-96 I ...”"
sayword3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1455439,"“Taste is good, effects are not (for me).
Chemicals, gas, and hint of citrus. Fluffy frosty potent bright lime nugs with dull orange hairs. This strain is very sativa dominate. I can't relate the name sake.
Uppity, energetic, giggly, anxiety. Effects are almost all mental, with a major body effect in the temples and eyes.
I don't think this strain will stick around for me.”"

Sleepwalkpowder,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1254640,"“Quickly becoming a favorite strain, especially late at night. Leaves a body relaxed, a little stuck but not overwhelmingly so, and inevitably sleepy on the come down. A good go-to if you're having trouble sleeping”"
AkaTeddd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1307139,"“Locktite I love this strain primarily due to GG or God Like Glue genetics.
When I had her she tasted of chocolate and orange deisel with uplifting effect.
I enjoyed this in concentrate form and man I wish I had more.
GG genetics are the best strain I have found for relieving my symptom's of pts and depression.I have a high tolerance and use CBD daily.”"

hjointsmoke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/locktite/reviews/1242001,"“The strain is very potent and has effects kind of similar to GG#4 but I have to be honest, the last 8t from Health for Life East was popping like corn it had so many white, useless seeds making the strain very sorry compared to some other times. Check out your buds before you leave, what a buzz kill, stuff isn't cheap. Not going to leave less stars because it it was a bad batch.”"
