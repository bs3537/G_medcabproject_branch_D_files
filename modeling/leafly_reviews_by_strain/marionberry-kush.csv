StLBudman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/marionberry-kush/reviews/1663185,"“My first neural/ negative review has to be this one. The taste was horrible. Like the dirt brick weed you'd get back in the early 90s from that stranger your buddy just met in the alley behind a bar. It got me high...decently high at that... that's why I gave 3 stars. The head high I got was delightful and lasted a good while. Just couldn't give it the last 2 because of the taste and smell.”"
Saucelord710,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/marionberry-kush/reviews/1626631,"“great terp profile. the high is very relaxing and smoke is heavy on the lungs just how I like it.”"
ashbub,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/marionberry-kush/reviews/1664682,"“I thought Space Queen and Purple Arrow could not be beat. Marionberry Kush gives them a run for their money. Clear headed and powerfully relaxing, this strain seems to make almost any situation better. Amazing results, but remember every body and everybody is different.”"

Sunni215,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/marionberry-kush/reviews/1792319,"“This is an instant hit. Literally. I smoke out of backwoods for the slow burn but after about 5 hits i kept looking at it cause i was fried and it was still a whole blunt left. The smell makes it seem so innocent with the sweet and fruity smell it has. Doesn't get you in a heavy state where you feel like you can't move but it does have a light lock. I recommend for when you just get off work or had a long day”"

I usually have this strain during the morning/early afternoon or at night sometime after work, and I'm amazed each time at just how flavorful and potent each dab is, whatever the size. My particular cut of the batch had a very nice merionberry tea-esque quality to the terpene profile in addition to some nice, light citrus notes. I love that this is not a heavy hitter (at least, it wa...”"

Phenotype I got smelled very similar space queen, like sweet sour berries, and had a similar strong cerebral effect mixed with a nice uplifting buzz. Seemed to give me the driest eyes ever though, almost like I'd eaten too many edibles. Well worth it, great strain.”"

It taste like a mix of sweet fruits with a squirt of lemon thrown in. It taste so good that You smoke it again just for the rich, fruity taste. It has an excellent effect that's uplifting, and makes People laugh. It grows kinda sparse though, with long branching.”"
