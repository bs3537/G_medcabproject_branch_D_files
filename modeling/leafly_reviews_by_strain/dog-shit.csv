Snowman8,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1394599,"“This strain is really relaxing my whole body felt like it was floating. I smoked it at a party and when the cops came the friend I smoked with and I just kept standing by the fire talking. Everyone kept running by us and then we finally realized we had to get the hell out of there. Then this morning my friend but just a little bit in his bubbler and I thought this isn't going to get me very high but I tell you what i...”"

It is very relaxing and quite euphoric. My first impressions of the bud were that they were very stinky and definitely lived up to their name however once I smoked it the smell evolved into something more sweet and pleasant. I hadn't found the strain since purchasing it that one time until today when I saw that N...”"

Did a bong rip right before a school dance, fell asleep on my food at Pizza Hut (the guys take the girls out to dinner before dances), drove around town in my beat down Jeep that had NO heat in the middle of winter AND ONE HEADLIGHT WAS OUT. Anyways, made it to the school dance next I’m home sleeping. When I wake up I PEE THE FREAKING BED GUYS! I was 18. Take this if you want a ...”"

And the high is great very cerebral... Energetic... happy... great social smoke..  I can't say enough about it!”"
serenab5,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1269199,"“Didn't remind me of dog shit so that was nice.. Took a couple hits from a joint before an after dinner hike. The terpenes I detected were fruit like, earthy and kind of sweet. I danced my way thru an hr hike and melted my stress away and I slept like a baby. Did come home and gobble down 3 bowls of cereal.. I don't care for the appetite stimulating part. I'm Italian, I don't need an extra nudge to eat. All and all it...”"

JJWDub90,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1212918,"“AKA Baby-Shit I like that name much better lol but this was a good strain. was able to smoke it in my dorm without people complaining lol.”"
kannabiscraig,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1395262,"“This strain was incredibly easy to grow. It was very resistant to all diseases. Grown under 600 watt LED and organically. During veg it definitely smelled of dog shit but quickly turned into a very sweet and sour fruity smell. The taste is very smooth and the high is all around great. I definitely recommend this strain to new growers and people dealing with heavy stress”"
johnthedrunk007,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1202106,"“Just picked up some of this strain from Cloud 9 medical in Sacremento.   Personally, i loved the strain and its effects. Gave me a very clear but potent high, I would recommend this strain to anyone.”"
sannti420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1224334,"“Doesnt taste really good, but when it comes to the feeling, I felt relaxed and in a really good mood, kinda difficult to control too, but really good if you have insomnia... when I got home from my friends house, as soon as I touched my bed, K.O hahaha. Not the best, but good.”"
MISSMARIAHRIAH,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1273877,"“Definetly reminiscent to its name. The earthy flavor was strong in this strain. The ending flavor also tended to be as mentioned above. Very stinky sticky and icky. By icky I mean super dope. Overall I enjoyed the uplifting high and appreciated the flavors. 😚💨”"
SilkyBravado,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1221714,"“A new favorite grown by an old friend.  Happiness and energy while being relaxed at the same time.  26% thc on mine.  This is no doubt a late afternoon delight.  The only negative for some might be increased appetite.  I'm too skinny to care luckily.  I have heard this strain was popular in Oregon throughput the 80s.”"
lawofsin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1382676,"“While the name and smell aren't super appealing this strain offers a great cerebral high. Great for anyone in need of creativity and energy. I mixed mine with strawberry cough for a sweet but pungent taste and aroma.”"

chazrashae,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1289314,"“It has a earthy taste. that mixed with the name gives me no relief. I feel like the high is delayed but more of a head, relaxing high. I prefer body highs.”"

Lotoweed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1638935,"“I smoke a lot. This is one of those strains that lasts a long time. Freezes time.”"
mas0868,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1728124,"“I give it 4 stars because of the smell. It literally smells like dog shit to the point of where I barely wanted to roll the blunt. I was some gas though omm 😼‼️”"

inditiva0,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1326429,"“Don't be turned off by the name. Dog poo offers a very happy high with little sparks of social energy and the propensity for munchies in high doses. Smell is strong, taste is pungent with berry undertones.”"

BabesTalkVAPES.com,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dog-shit/reviews/1598735,"“we have another form of animal extremist although this one of a different sort. Dog Shit is a Sativa dominant hybrid that is well known for its aroma, and taste which, as you can probably guess, strongly resembles dog feces. Made from Purple Zacatecas, crossed with Columbian Gold, Cambodian, and Afghani this strain, if you can get over the taste and smell, has a very relaxing and creative vibe associated with it.
