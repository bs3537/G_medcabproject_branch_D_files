Dutch Treat Haze

imdevv,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/reviews/1394006,"“Picked this up by recommendation from a local recreational shop, was told it was their go-to when people ask for a 'good sativa', so I figured I'd give it a shot.                

Mental feeling-  
Definitely helped manage the rush, overwhelming-ness, and unpredictability of anxiety. Not energetic but not lazy, mostly just a nice, relaxing, calm sensation. I was more open to things (because I wasn't nervous), I allow...”"

eric29,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/reviews/1385836,"“Dutch Treat Haze… a very well rounded slightly sativa dominant strain. Picked this up from The Novel Tree in Bellevue, WA. Grown by Raven Grass in Olympia washington, Dutch Treat Haze was quite potent for me and definitely got me more stoned than NYC Diesel or Montana Silver Tip. Not a whole lot of body buzz, just more of a heady inebriated feeling. This would be a great party strain to substitute for alcohol. I coul...”"

StonerToTheLeft,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/reviews/1366642,"“Floral, fruity, slightly earthy and LOUD. As far as hazes go, this one is top notch. Three hits and I was good to go for the day, long lasting euphoria with pulsating visuals when you close your eyes and sativa dominance is apparent in its energetic wonder.”"
okietokie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/reviews/1429845,"“This strain is probably one of the best in Colorado.  It is certainly my favorite of all time.  I like everything about this strain, the look, the taste, the smell, the high.  Sativa dominant, sweet potent smell and flavor.  A very heady long lasting high.  The buds are very sticky and sparkle under light.  Top shelf, for me it doesn't get any better.”"

So many strains smell like lemons and pine, and Dutch Treat Haze does too, yet without any chemical traces. I know calling a flower floral is redundant, so I will say it is herbal and smells splendid and sweet. It looks fantastic in the jar—ve...”"
NerdyMo420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/reviews/1382814,"“Very good strain. Effects definitely lean to the sativa side and are very euphoric and hazy in the head, good social strain. Provides a slight energy boost but also sends a calm throughout the body. For me it helps with anxiety, social anxiety, and depression.”"

It's a super uplifting euphoric head high, with a very relaxing body feeling from the high CBD and THC content. This is definitely one of my personal favorites for everyday pick me up use. You can never go wrong with Project M's Dutch Treat Haze!

IandI,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/reviews/1346198,"“This one made us amorous and giggly. We had so much fun just playing in the park. Definitely a good beach day strain or strolling through nature or good, slow sex. We later smoked this one with my 84 year old uncle, and he perked up and was acting 30 years younger. Picked up in Seattle as a pre roll.”"

WickedViking,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/reviews/1721146,"“Definitely a great strain if you wanna sleep really good. I dont wake up feeling nauseous at all, mainly hungry. Wake n bake is fantastic. I LOVE the flavor. Only downfall about this strain is that it knocks you out if you smoke too much of it at one time. And it gives you hella munchies. However, it has you craving weird things, like cinnamon roll poptarts with ice cream (dont judge, you've all done it lol)”"
SlothOnAStick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dutch-treat-haze/reviews/1682663,"“Decided to choose this as a free eighth, and I’m glad I did. The effects of this are quite uplifting but the relaxation actually put me into bed for the night. Overall a really good strain.”"

Felt heavy on my chest too the first few times I smoked it but not so much anymore.”"
