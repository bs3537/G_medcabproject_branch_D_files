doctorloomis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-og/reviews/1417667,"“Blue OG gives early hints of a sickeningly-sweet scent of diluted jet fuel that turns into robust growth with progressive skunk undertones the further into flowering you go. After 8 weeks of flowering, Blue OG can be cut and put into curing. If you can go 9-10 weeks of flowering, the plant will continue to grow and amaze you with its late growth. Blue OG has a deep sea-green color to its buds once broken apart, which...”"
