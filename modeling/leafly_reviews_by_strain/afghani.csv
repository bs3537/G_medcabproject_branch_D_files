Normal "couchlock" indicas seem to have very little sedative effect on me, but this Afghani stuff has managed to actually WORK :).  All most of the other ones did was get me high and make me even more awake.  Not Afghani.  Took about a tenth of a gram 20 minutes ago and I'm feeling like I will be able to sleep tonight.  No big, destr...”"

Anyway while I was in the army I was stationed in Afghanistan, and a few soldiers had a strain there called Afgan ( I'm not 100% sure if this is it or not) Anyway that weed made me really relaxed and sleepy. It was very good to get a nights rest if under shell shock or gunfire.”"

A bit of a Nag Champa hint upon tasting the unlit joint. Smoke is thick, pungent and lingering. Charges like a bull right out of the gate with a heavy stone and body high. This is a favorite strain of mine because of its ability to stamp out my muscle spasms and Sciatica almost instantly. It's one of...”"
Farva253,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afghani/reviews/1409901,"“This strain was suggested to me based on wanting a pure indica. I learned that this is a landrace strain because it's named after the region it naturally grows in.
The batch I purchased came from World of Weed in Tacoma, WA. The grower was Triple T Farms, harvested on 9/01/2015 and packaged on 9/25/2015. I usually break a bud and inhale nice and deep to get the nose - it smells like a bowl of sunflower shells mixed w...”"

The guy I used to get my old school hash from used this strain, getting back to school after lunch was always a challenge. The buds are dense bright green with lot's of orange red hairs.

Smoke too much and you'll wake up the next day without any idea of how you fell asleep or take a one huge hit and you'll feel like a Terminator.

A total melting away of every care in the world. Moderate narcotic-like euphoria. Amazing for pain, depression, and insomnia. This is definitely one of my favorite concentrate strains, great for hash-making.”"
