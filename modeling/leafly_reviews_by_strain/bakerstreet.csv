exSkye,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bakerstreet/reviews/1638879,"“I order the milled, personally, because I need immediate access as this my go-to stain during asthma attacks. greatly lowers stress and anxiety, helps relax, and has lowered my needed use of other bronchodilators.”"
FlowerDough,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bakerstreet/reviews/1356225,"“When I started using tweed in October 2016, this strain was a game changer for me, with a major reduction in muscle tightness (reduction and prevention), pain relief, as well as sedative effects. A good mellow feeling.

So after waiting for MONTHS for new stock at Tweed, I bought 40 grams before realizing the THC had dropped 10%, I didn't think the drop from 28 to 18 would be that big of a deal, but it was. It's stil...”"

I have been with tweed for 3 years now. Bakerstreet is my go to. 
It works for my backpain and my anxiety at the same time.  Would HIGHly recommend this strain.”"
ayes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bakerstreet/reviews/1652175,"“It’s nice and dank! It does make me anxious/panicky with too much. It helps with pain but it’s true calling is sleep. At times it can cause some thinky sadness and a few times had full-on panic attack from too much. If you suffer from depression, don’t use when affected. When vaping for bed I will add some pure cbd medical cannabis to the mix. It helps with effectiveness and THC induced anxiety/panic reduction.”"

stinky
 and taste like a nope from Me. Sorry not sorry xo”"
Keithmj,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bakerstreet/reviews/1757058,"“Just ok. Weed was hard and dried out. Small crappy buds i wish i had weighed the bottle.
Maybe a better idea would be ditch the plastic jar and fancy box and sell the pot in a bag and charge less”"
thecanadianwitch,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bakerstreet/reviews/1623378,"“It's truly pure indica perfect for insomniacs. Don't believe the insomnia barely there line, it will make you sleepy. Not a fan of the very earthy taste, quite overpowering and doesn't make the best tasting joints. This is gonna be a bong/recycler type of strain.”"
mikeoxsbigg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bakerstreet/reviews/1348399,"“Unexpected notes of cheese... the sandalwood smell and earthy notes are also there. THC 18.8 From Tweed. I had no issues with delivery.  It vapes really good. Nice head buzz and pain distraction.”"
ENTrylevel420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bakerstreet/reviews/1218291,"“Bakerstreet Is a fairly powerful indica.
As much as I love the effects of this strain, it smells and tastes awful which makes it hard to smoke. When I smoked this strain, I got very emotional and felt somewhat lonely. I recommend Bakerstreet if your going to see a movie, it brings out the emotion in the characters.
Good strain, not great”"
canuck68,https://www.leafly.com/indica/bakerstreet/reviews/1347728,"“I'm a medical user and gotta say - I've tried most of them but for daytime use for constant back pain, this works well. Your mileage may vary, but feel free to mix it with some Pink or OG to magnify the effect. Very nice body effects seem to block pain pathways with this strain. Nice not to have too much of a heady high effect too. This is almost 100% body effects. 
Taste is earthy and woody, similar to Afghani.
Batc...”"

Budtender basically a picked myself a good one. I receive it packaging is great and I love to see the logistics awesome job there and get a card with all medical info on it .Now this stuff looked  pretty good , taste good but no feeling and it's supposed to kill 
pain but instead I suffer for 3 days with nothing! I  do not recommend to...”"
