The taste is cheesy with earthy notes. I smoked this strain for depression and social anxiety and I feel more relaxed and my head is clear. this is is the strain if you just want relax and not get to stoned to function”"

Bananiolo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/balmoral/reviews/1737428,"“The UK cheese background of that strain gives it a musty odor and the smooth taste of a fine indoor strain. The effets are a bit strong as this is 19.7% thc. Very focused high, strong couchlock effect.”"

But taste wise..... It taste pretty bad.  No cheese flavor, nothing.  Smooth but there is a strange flavor when I smoke it.  Tweed flavor should I say?

Product is dried. Not bone dried.  It doesn't crumble when you squeeze it. But more on the dried side. 

If you don't care much about taste but potency only, this is a great product.  

I am too much of a connoisseur that I c...”"
