I had this as a pot cookie. It was VERY potent. Less experienced people should beware not to over-indulge. It can induce mild panic/paranoia. The OG eventually takes over and just melts away any tension in your body. This is definitely in my top 3 favorite strains, along with Shiva Skunk and Blueberry Cheesecake. Do n...”"

I was surprised to read its a 60/40 sativa dominant strain as i bought this strain because of it's high THC% and the fact that kush's are usually heavy Indica dominant. None the less it still did the job, just not knock out like lets say....kosher kush.”"

magtak,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kaia-kush/reviews/1148200,"“I actually asked for this strain to be included in Leafly. I picked from my supplier to "give it a try" and now it's never missing from my stash. Amazing strain - Kudos to the creator :)”"
bezerkben,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kaia-kush/reviews/1148199,"“Thick vapor light buzz after a few draws. Amazing flavor. Deep earthy flavor with some light citrus notes. 5 min in. I'm ripped. Good clear high in the head. Slight body buzz. Great for productivity. Enjoy!!”"

It's a stimulant! Not unlike 3 shots of espresso, without any of the caffeine jitters or caffeine 'crash' later. Hands down the single greatest "morning smoke" of all time. Dab,  jump right into work, be insanely productive for several hours straight, look up at ...”"

RedHairs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kaia-kush/reviews/1290672,"“The day I smoked this I wasn't feeling well at all. It helped a lot for a sativa dominatant. I smoked a big fat joint and went to Red Robins, my body was so relaxed and I was so aware of my.surrounding. Ate tonnes of food too. All around I think this strain is great 🖒”"
r212,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kaia-kush/reviews/1252228,"“This strain made me cough a lot and I normally don't cough. But once I got high I had the jitters and I got really energetic. I felt super productive, so this strain is defiantly good for school or work. And since it's a hybrid I felt that sativa at first and then after my energy passed about an hour into the high I lied in bed. My thoughts were like my own personal movie and I was literally entertained. I fell aslee...”"

All of my mates and i have been smoking for years, but when everyone is over for a braai/BBQ i only need to roll a long thin toothpick size joint and you are so super lifted that you cant believe you only had 2 or 3 drags of a skinny join.

Leaves on the tree grow bigger that a fully grown mans hand.
Super easy to grow, very short stocky tree and surprisingly resilient against bugs, mil...”"

MarijuanaMYK,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kaia-kush/reviews/1299194,"“👤 Very Good Sativa! It's effective nature definitely gives you an upper hand against PTSD. The benefits are certainly worth the wild. 💯”"
LaGoong,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kaia-kush/reviews/1277686,"“Buds had a nice integrity, not dense though, light and fluffy. Took as big a rip as I could on the first to get as full a sense of the flavor as possible. Very smooth, and you can feel the flavors unfold, if you will, rather than explode on the inhale. Earthy, but with subtle hints of fruit and spice. No cough despite the huge hit. Description says onset can be slow, but I'm feeling this pretty quickly. Buzz is clear...”"
