THC level is high.
Incredible Afghani Hash smell!!”"

Uplifted, heady, productive high overall with a good flavor. Hits you fast and is strong and long lasting. A new fav, only downside is cotton mouth, but that's nothing chai tea can't fix. Something that is a positive and negative is it doesn't give me the munchies like most other strains would.”"

Makes you feel like you're floating about 3 ft above the ground or like I was in a hammock overlooking the beach in Hawaii. Would be good to use while golfing, on a picnic, barbecuing, boating or just to chill.”"
