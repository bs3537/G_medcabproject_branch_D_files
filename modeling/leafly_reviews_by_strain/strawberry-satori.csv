A nice counterpoint to some of the more racy sativas, and a true connoisseur strain. Lovely fruity bouquet, and a very smooth burn. My go-to daytime workout/hangout meds, kudos to the breeder!”"
Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1274194,"“probably a 4.2 for me, if you're looking for low paranoia, this is probably a 5. Smooth, laid back slightly spaced vibes. Overall pain relief is maybe a 3.5, giggles 4.5, uplifting 4, creative feeling 4.”"
Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1186261,"“Great sweet aroma, with an earthy musk, makes you want to smoke it. overall for my first experience I'd give it a 4.5. Holds on to fun giggly feeling of Strawberry cough, with a little smoother smoke and a more stoney vibe. definitely spacey vibe, feel functional, but distracted.  Reduction in back pain, and feelings of stress.”"
Cybelle,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1146199,"“Great for anxiety in social situations. Increases focus and stops the racing brain.”"
Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1238243,"“Solid Strain! Probably a 5 star strain if you want a little pain relief and or mood elevation. Not very Spacey, easy enough to focus. Very good for overall happiness and some giggles without the paranoia of some strains.”"
theta444,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1213716,"“I'm a lightweight/novice user. hit it a bit too hard the first time; gave me symptoms of uplifted, giggly, creative,  open minded; also made me a tiny bit paranoid. felt very aware of my body and had to lie down and have my husband massage me. :-) Second time hit it a bit easier and was still giggly but a bit zoned out.”"

PizzaChamp420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1223165,"“Experience: Really strong, intense strain. Social, semi-talkative, chillaxing, inebriating.

Look/Feel: Jungle green with many thick red, fuzzy hairs. Fine crystals. Dense buds
Smell: Skunky, mildewy, woody.
Taste/Smoke: Clear headed, uplifting high. Mildly sweet, light-medium smoke.”"

Levels out anxiety even if you think you don't have it- it's effects profoundly changed me- realized I had some anxiety cause I felt normal and fully relaxed yet alert and super creative. Amazing strain if you are looking for creative strain.”"
DaltonPTaylor,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1284191,"“Oh my god the high from the strawberry satori was as potent as an indica with a high that's mostly sativa like. Made me feel chill, creative comfortable, and content. Also one of my new favorite flavors, with the strawberry standing out.

asapisaiah,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1218310,"“Best awake high for working and really helps with anxiety on busy work nights! Definitely hit up Panacea to try this out! For medical patients, the Satori CO2 oil is also amazing.”"
kloser2fine,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1201606,"“I can't speak to the effects of smoking, because I made butter with it and baked brownies. I probably ate about 7mg worth (low tolerance), and it was fine. Nothing to sing about. It didn't feel like a sativa dominant at all. I was very lazy and I'm about to go to bed early, after trying to stay awake for a couple hours. It gave me major munchies, the tiniest bit of paranoia, and a ditzy, apathetic feeling. It didn't ...”"
bluejello,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1490542,"“Strawberry Satori is a phenomenal strain. The flavors are sweet and fruity, reminiscent of its strawberry cough parent. The high is very creative and uplifting, and gives a relaxed mellow feeling. I was pleasantly surprised by the anxiety reducing effects of this strain as well. I had given up most varieties as they tended to exacerbate existing anxieties, but strawberry satori just gives a lovely energetic and calmi...”"
Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1207861,"“very nice uplifting high this time! needed it tonight. Feel happy, and a bit giggly without feeling really stoned. similar to having just the right amount of red wine, with added pain relief.”"
omgpizza,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1224464,"“A fantastic strain, expertly grown. It's excellent for anxiety, social or otherwise.”"
tenfoot1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1135870,"“Creative and social, Strawberry Satori is my go-to strain for mildly-energizing daytime anxiety relief. A strain for the true connoisseur, floral, athletic, and truly functional. You will not be disappointed.”"
MagicMonkey,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1226020,"“For me this amazing Sativa is an easy 5 stars. If you like Jack Herer you'll love this strain. Wake and bake to get your day started with this beauty and enjoy. Look for Strawberry Satori through GreenWise Farms. They know what they are doing. You won't be disappointed.”"

drunkrodeoclown,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1165290,"“Good smoke for daytime. Very creative / inspired feeling. Has a tendency to be distracting, so everything seems to take me 50% longer because I get halfway done with something and then get excited about something else and run off to do that.”"
juliaclaire0,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-satori/reviews/1507133,"“One of my favorite strains, except it is rather harsh on the throat. Good taste and smell, low paranoia, good for daytime. I did find that the sativa effects were so intense that I also needed to pick up a strong indica to wind down at night time. Overall a solid strain and true contender!”"
