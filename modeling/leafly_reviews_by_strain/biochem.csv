Boke,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1398423,"“Really good strain,but its really strong. I tripped out for a good 10 minutes and then it knocked me OUT. This stuff gave me the best darn sleep of my life. Would recommend 8/10. Not a daytime strain but perfect for a good night.”"
OldToby214,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1414197,"“So biochem, I bought this Spherex distillate at The Joint and it tests at 73%. My impressions of this strain are very good. It is a great 2-way indica. I say that because this is great sleepy strain, one of the best I have encountered, usually no strain of cannabis makes me weary. This however, is easily countermanded with some caffeine. Making this a perfect strain for individuals with ADHD or ADD. The physical effe...”"

JZZZM3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1367890,"“This is some great, smooth bud that will help you shrug off the stress at the end of the day. Nice mellow, calming high. Tastes great. Kinda arousing too. So settle in with your significant other to chill at night and you'll sleep like a baby.”"
SlowNorman2008,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1367889,"“This strain is super relaxing and euphoric. Not a good day time strain as it did couchlock me for a little bit. I smoked a big bowl of this and got an extreme body high with tingles then got some of the best sleep I have had in a while.”"
tara925,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1378429,"“made me so hungry. I felt like I was starving to death. have a snack before using”"
Rocker17,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1531919,"“Oooo-ooo, that smell! Can’t you smell that SMELL?!

The most pungent strain I’ve ever had the pleasure to enjoy thus far. Definitely a nighttime delicacy. 

Or an excellent wake-and-bake when playing hooky from adulting.”"
StLBudman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1518988,"“Damn!!!  Picked up an eighth today and have only taken one hit in three hours and "my check is cashed"...still.  The resin on the flower is beyond compare. The taste is unusual to me. I've never tasted this type of flavor from any other bud. It almost has a cheese flavor to me. The high is amazing. Eyelids are heavy. Butt is locked to the couch. Full body high...tingly feeling in my head. Probably will become one of ...”"
JourneyAlee,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1527177,"“This strain is a "5" in terms of knockout  effect, but it earns a "4" overall due to the smoking experience, which is dense and harsh. I can definitely achieve full stonage with half as much of this strain as any other, so it's a great strain to stretch your dollar. It's just too thick a toke for me and left me with a sore throat each time I smoked it. Scent is earthy and grassy with a nice spice undertone. Biochem w...”"

Kdubs21,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1672237,"“Solid strain that will make you hungry and sleepy. Very heavy smoke”"
Rzrbackbelle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1394879,"“A complete zone-out strain. Great for just chilling in front of the TV. Relaxing.”"
IncogNeato,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1319488,"“Chill couchlock, bit of giggles and munchies”"
Drunvalo420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1389017,"“Incredibly strong smoke, melts your face right off after one blunt. I couldn't not move at all on this, all my limbs were jelly.
This strain does not play around and the initial high is very racey and euphoric but it doesn't quickly come down and smack you down in to the bed with a packet of chips. Great strain, can see myself going with this choice a few more times.”"
GingerGoblinBSW,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1319992,"“Maggie's farm is a great supplier of this, heavy and deep high :)”"
Gramswild,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1455764,"“My favorite bedtime snack....I always sleep like a baby after just one or two hits of this strain.  I can literally make an 1/8th last for months that way. If you suffer from insomnia, this is the medicine to try. It works every time.”"
dblk,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1450475,"“nice calming senses&soothing.”"
thunderbuns,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1392123,"“This is by far my favorite indica strain. It gives you a peaceful, mellow feeling before knocking you out. Like the perfect one-two punch combo. I generally have trouble falling asleep and staying asleel. This strain eliminates that issue. I sleep like the dead, But I don't feel groggy upon waking. I also love the taste of this one.”"
MaM91,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1588305,"“OMG amazing loved it like best thing for after a long day at work”"
BigKahunaBudder,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1540170,"“One of my favorite strains. Smell has cheesy undertones and the buds are so densely packed and fuzzy from the trichromes. Smoke is flavorful, and provides a long-lasting sedating high. Perfect for unwinding after a hard day's work and passing out while watching TV before a long night's sleep.”"

purplehaze13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1508044,"“One of the best strains I have ever smoked in 40 years. Excellent pain killer and it will leave you in the floor giggling .”"
OldToby214,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1612963,"“This is a great hybrid indica strain.  Biochem is pretty  OP, so it will overwhelm a beginning user.  When I got this strain, it was so kiefy I could barely see the purple leaves.  The sensations of the strain are quite pleasant.  I feel a prevalent head high and subtle body high that is good for muscle relaxation.  It feels like effects of Asgardian Magic.  The flavors are sweet with a hint of citrus and berry.”"
Terri16,https://www.leafly.com/indica/biochem/reviews/1680077,"“my personal fave (drooling)... love the taste!”"
