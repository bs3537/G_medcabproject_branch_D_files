The Cambodian government is increasing its crackdown on this flower. However one can still find "Happy Pizza" parlours all over the place.

Smell: Very earthy with a hint of sweetness to it.
Effect: High. Very suitable for day use as it gets you very active.”"

Yahoo_AZ,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cambodian/reviews/1349079,"“Definitely a medical smell.  The shape of the buds looked very similar to the Cambo I tried earlier this year in Laos.  This stuff is great, soaring "happy" buzz, but very sleep inducing if you are tired.”"

You get quite sick of the earthy taste a some point. But in general its a good strain to get high and chill with friends.”"

Bart8888,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cambodian/reviews/1744302,"“Had this several times I  both  Vietnam and Cambodia. The high is quite meditational and inspiring. Nothing like the Dutch sativas or Hazes...much milder. You can smoke this stuff all day long and it's fun for that. The big drawback is how its grown and dried locally.
