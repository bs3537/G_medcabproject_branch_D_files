Went with this amd whitealker og hoping one would knock me out. Whitewalker OG was a good taste of indica but the WMD hit me like a train. Tasted like bubba kush to me but super powerful!
Super impressed with my dispensary having it.”"
irishtobias,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wmd/reviews/1353773,"“A fine sleep aid, appetite stimulant and all around gnarly indica. Grabbed this a few times from Canna Clinic in Kensington market, Toronto and would rank it among the best I've purchased there. The flavour is very enjoyable but somewhat hard to describe. Not especially functional, but great for relaxation.”"

DuppyKilla,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wmd/reviews/1339454,"“Closer to a 4.5 than a 4, I've been smoking the strain all day and smoking a spliff of it right now. Very relaxing indica strain, encourages appetite. Nice green bud with hues of purple. Earthy sweet taste. 

Grabbed it from Canna Clinic. Great for a late night spliff.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wmd/reviews/1741883,"“OMG another F'n Incredible child?

That parent alone makes this strain worth buying above any others.  I would do anything to keep this or FI as a permanent staple in my medicine box.

The taste, smell, look, and feeling of it is exactly what you picture when you think of medical or dank weed.”"
fr3shlybak3d,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wmd/reviews/1354261,"“First got the concentrate and loved it, needed to see if the bud was on point also and it was. This strain quickly over to the top 10 for me. Great for depression and pain relief, can be used as a treatment for insomnia though I think there are better strains for it. Every time I grab this strain its super dank! Highly suggest for indica lovers!”"

alex_emerson_,https://www.leafly.com/indica/wmd/reviews/1359162,"“Best strain I've experienced for depression/anxiety. Purchased from Canna Clinic in Toronto and is now a favourite. Really lifts my spirits for the depression without giving me paranoia or racing thoughts, and relaxes the body to soothe my anxiety symptoms. It also smells amazing, really tight, dank buds and a nice smooth smoke!”"
