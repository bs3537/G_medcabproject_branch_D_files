azmiked,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-skunk/reviews/1378629,"“This particular flower was grown locally here at my dispensary in Mesa, I have been liking the skunk strains lately and wanted to give theirs a try. The buds were popcorn nugs but for the most part well developed, very hairy with plenty of crystals and nice and fresh. After a fresh grind (which smelled wonderful by the way, like an earthy cherry aroma) and a few hits from the pipe this strain did what it was supposed...”"
UrsaMajor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-skunk/reviews/1417301,"“A pleasant reprieve, Deep, moss green buds overrun with a tangle of orange hairs. Thin layers of frost give the impression of dew on a freshly cut lawn.

A faint cherry/stone fruit scent can be picked up, but the smell is mostly earthy, and a little pungent. Smoke is smooth, with an interesting cardamon/star anise flavor that reminds of Indian sweets. (or clove cigarettes) It's an exotic taste that I became rather fo...”"
ErosKing,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-skunk/reviews/1350954,"“you can taste the cherry on inhale, and both cherry, and skunk on exhale. Nugs are thick, and somewhat tight.

thewhitewidow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-skunk/reviews/1185042,"“Great cherry flavor with that skunky taste. It hits you almost instantly, kinda like a Trainwreck. Definitely more of a Sativa, I don't really get much productive done, but I focus intently on little tasks (like Leafly reviews and my mac and cheese perfection). I like this strain a lot, I've had 3 or 4 people tell me now it's pretty bomb.”"

Prairie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-skunk/reviews/1273559,"“Gives energy and an uplifting high.  Good for mood, moderate pain relief and focus.  The high isn't overpowering, so Cherry Skunk is a good choice for daytime medicine.  Smokes nice and smooth.  Even though this is an indica-dominant hybrid, the high is more cerebral than body.”"

Be careful, this strain has a good kick.  Hold the smoke too long and you might convulse -- and come out of it with a big smile on your face.

Because I've never tasted this strain before, I look forward to another try.”"
