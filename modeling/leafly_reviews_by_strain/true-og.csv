Is a chilling high, but you can easily focus and do things like schoolwork, cleaning, etc. totally fine. Aroused, possibly. Depends on where your mindset is when you go into the high. Easy to laugh. Relieves stress a little, to the point where you're calm about it, but you still know you have to do something about it. Aware. Overall good high. Doesn't help with sleep TO much though.‚Äù"

I purchased this strain at Medicine Man Medical Market located in Glendale Colorado. The initial sting of its aroma was pungent and had a light citrus waft to it, it was very pleasant. The density of the buds, the aroma, and the visual aesthetic was very pleasing.

SFV is a wonderful line of genetics and everything that comes from it is awesome. I can't remember the other parent tho, but this strain is a little less INTENSE than the SFV i've been smoking. It is more like the SFV but SFV makes me laugh and sing songs, while this medicine lets me mellow out and focus on work. Still a great bud, SFV is t...‚Äù"

This one is really dense. Like green knobby golf balls covered in sugar.
Very Dark Green with a White/Purple sheen. Small little calyx and short lil hairs, but bulky and chunky.

The smell is incredible when True Og expresses it's true charecteristics. A very winter green and fuel smell, not minty, but a fresh pine tree in the winter with a whif of gasoline.

Upon arrival home with my new Medical Marijuana (which was highly recommended), I began the anticipation with an oral ingestion via smoking apparatus of True OG.
