Nice hybrid to utilize when you need to keep moving, but lethargy, tension, and pain are holding you back. Tangy and sweet taste and aroma; nice light green color with golden pistils.”"

The taste of this strain goes through more than one flavor, from some fruity notes to a mild incense that burns deep. The high works with my body chemistry so well.
