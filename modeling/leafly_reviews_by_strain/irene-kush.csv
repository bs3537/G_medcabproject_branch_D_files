=============
Zillanski,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/irene-kush/reviews/1416879,"“Irene is a grown ass woman and she WILL put her hands on you. Like Irene has hella domestic violence charges against her. Every time we get together she makes me lay down on the floor for hours... krazy girl.”"
waterfallwellnessSF,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/irene-kush/reviews/1342830,"“I got this sample from a vendor and it's not too shabby. It has to be a cross of Master Kush because of the pungently sweet kick it has. Very cerebral with a slight body buzz. Good for wanting to be productive and creative. Recommended for daytime use and use for wanting to alleviate headaches and anxiety. No paranoia attached to this euphoric uplift. It slowly sinks your body but it is mellow. Good find.”"
pboyer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/irene-kush/reviews/1159321,"“Irene Kush is my current favorite medicine.  It is the perfect combo of cerebral and body relaxation.  I have fibromyalgia and chronic pain.  It seems to do a great job of both.

Would highly recommend this strain.”"
