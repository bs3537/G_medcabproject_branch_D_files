I've been trying so many different strains (never even knew there were different strains!) for the various health issues, from head to toe.  To me, my worst issue is depression, but my spouse thinks it is my fatigue & weakness, since I'm not as productive since becoming sick.  Either way, Commerce City has hands down won my...”"

Needless to say growing use filtration and novices beware. I can smoke it till the cows come home but funny to watch people say..."I'm toooooo fucked up..." enjoy responsibly!! :)”"
