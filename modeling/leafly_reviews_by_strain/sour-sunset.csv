Sour Sunset
=============
kooshboosh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1376167,"‚ÄúI don't even know where to start with this one. First off, the buds look absolutely gorgeous. Crazy huge trichomes, beautiful pale orange pistils, nice fat calyxes, and an overall amazing size, shape, and density. The smell is orgasmic! You get the classic Sunset Sherbet flavor and smell, but with a slight hint of sour fruit and gasoline. This strain is just stupid potent. My tolerance is through the roof, but every ...‚Äù"

I'll say this dispo keeps very nice, fresh, well manicured flowers.  This strain however stood out for its phenomenal flavor as well as potent effects.  The cut I got was testing at 24% and it definitely didn't hold back.  I got great relaxing hybrid effects as described by Leafly, it never was sedating or racey. It was just right.  It's a strain that makes you ap...‚Äù"
coachchronic89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1298034,"‚Äúmy new go-to daytime strain. perfect for heavy users that find themselves remedicating too often with straight sativa. just enough indica to get some good calming body effects but definitely more towards the sativa side. I'm in the clouds but totally clear headed. the nugs are abundant with redish-Orange hairs and a little on the darker side. very very dense nugs. doesn't break up well by hand so go with a grinder. s...‚Äù"
NASchnitzius,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1370905,"‚ÄúThis strain is a super hyperactive high at first, until your peak. Then my heart rate began still slow and I was suddenly relaxed and mellow. Very happy.
The strain has a piney and citrusy smell to it. While the taste is sort of earthy and piney as well. I used grinded weed, on the first bowl I smoke I. Notice the weed wasn't as smooth in the beginning. After the first couple of hits I felt it kicking pretty fast.

CannnabisConnoisseur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1449096,"‚ÄúThis is a nice SATIVA dominant strain, in spite of what Leafly shows as an INDICA dominant (60%). Leafly info so often is off if not way off - where do they get their data? Do they just make shit up?  I hate to get on their case, but if Leafly doesn't get its act together in really making sure their info is accurate, they'll soon be known as the fake news of MMJ. The strain is excellent though if you're looking for s...‚Äù"
s4mk1ng,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1269338,"‚ÄúThis strain will hit you immediately with a real cerebral high you can feel right behind your eyes. The sativa feeling takes over right away and is eventually taken over by a heavy indica feeling a while later. definitely recommend giving this one a try. tastes great too!‚Äù"
HybridDragon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1396769,"‚ÄúGood strain.I could feel the high take over immediately and then settle across you in a blanket effect after 10 minutes.Alot more indica than sativa but the sativa keeps you moving along doing whatever you want.The indica side calms your breathing and relaxation sets in after about 20 minutes.Tense muscles and anxiety disappear in a haze of forgetfulness after about 30 minutes.If you like getting really realllllly hi...‚Äù"

jarthe3,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1363617,"‚ÄúGreat early morning smoke to start the day.

thesarawich,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1267767,"‚ÄúSmoked very smoothly, didn't cause me to  cough at all. Easy on the throat. Very sweet and fruity smell. Definitely left me with a floating feeling and wasn't heavy or sleep-inducing. Will probably become a go-to for daytime.‚Äù"

coachchronic89,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1280078,"‚Äúperfect daytime strain for a everyday smoker. just enough indica that you won't feel the need to medicate every hour. I'm in the clouds but all the while very clearheaded. reminds me of some of my favorite sativas (Jack herer, super silver haze, chocolope, etc.) but it has a longer peak duration. very hard and dense nugs containing a plethora of hairs and frost. earthy smell with some fuel. buy it. burn it. love it. ...‚Äù"
OnetrueOneil,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1262313,"‚ÄúVery nice taste and fragrance. Burns well,slowly and continues to provide nice flavor thru the bowl.  Beautiful buds on small stems. Works well to relieve stress without the total knockout of some.  Great day-use.‚Äù"

medicalguy62,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1269842,"‚ÄúFruity smelling, mellow, underrated strain. There is certainly a sativa kick to be felt, but it is more of a sedative than a stimulant. A nice, cool tingly rush soothes your body as your thoughts and surroundings become more intense. I certainly enjoy its presence of the psychedelic vibe. I hope it gets more attention in the future‚Äù"
jessie1024,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1380023,"‚ÄúExcellent strain! My new favorite! It's calming but doesn't make you a zombie. Smells great and hits you immediately. I will definitely be getting more.‚Äù"
soapworks,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1269884,"‚ÄúIm always on the lookout for specific strains like Sour Diesel, but always jump at the chance to try strains with my fav's with the addition of secret sherbet giving it a extra flavor, she ends of being an indica dominant strain with about a 60/40 split, the flavours i experienced was extremely sweet and fruity on the inhale but on the exhale is where i experienced the most potent orange gas terps, the effects immedi...‚Äù"
BuggySmalls,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1370776,"‚ÄúSmoked it a couple of times and every time it was amazing. A very mellowed out high, the dry mouth was definitely apparent though so I suggest keeping a drink close by when smoking Sour Sunset‚Äù"
condog1197,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1300867,"‚ÄúThis is a stout yet refreshing smoke with an uplifting effect. I picked up a preroll of this strain from the dispensary near me, then later returned to get some shatter of the same strain. I can't say or been more satisfied with a strain in all my years of medicating.‚Äù"
g.kirk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1416822,"‚ÄúThis strain is a solid combo of Sherbet & AJ's SD. While I don't think it is a quite as potent as everyone else has remarked, it is a great morning or daytime strain. It has fantastic bag appeal with a nice dusting of sugary trichomes & a wonderful fruity smell with diesely undertones. I'm high but relatively clear headed, theres a bit of a lag with my brain but nothing that will stop me from completing my work today...‚Äù"
hippylocs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-sunset/reviews/1265384,"‚ÄúI can really get with this flavor, smooth on my throat, nice and fluffy so you buy an 8thy and it looks like a 7 üëç. that's always a plus.. gave me that floating feeling, I love that. keep getting lifted ‚úå‚Äù"
