I'm such a fan of both of these strains and I have to say that Space Cream takes the cake. The taste of this hybrid is unbelievable. So smooth, creamy, sweet and earthy. Great for depression or stress, it gives you a peace of mind while allowing you to still function. It put a smile on my face and put me in a very tranqu...”"
StShaun,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-cream/reviews/1368707,"“My overall favorite.  To me this is the best of both worlds.  I would say it is both indica and sativa dominate as it tends to energize the mind while relaxing the body.  No couch lock unless already tired.  Perfect strain for anxiety as it relaxes without couch lock without any paranoia.

Vaping seems to produce a clearer headed more sativa dominant experience while smoking brings more of an indica experience with g...”"

Brings a nice light head buzz and body calm. I didn't feel any hazy mental effects, but did feel some uplifting and happy mood boost. 
Definite creamy and slight citrus taste/odor. Smooth hits.”"

Pretty uplifting but kinda heavy. I can tell it's an indica dominate strain but it doesn't completely couch me either. Leaves a light euphoric feeling”"

JourneyAlee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-cream/reviews/1373280,"“Space Cream is one of my go-to standard strains for dealing with pain from hydrocephalus. There are many strains that don't affect me at all, and others that I enjoy but develop a tolerance to way too quickly. Space Cream *isn't* one of those. I usually get huge, tight buds but the small ones (and the shake) do the job just as well. I often mix Space Cream with Bordello for serious pain relief that leaves me feeling ...”"

trvppyk07,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-cream/reviews/1542812,"“Great strain overall. You can definitely taste a cream-like aftertaste on this one. Really an outstanding euphoric high especially at higher doses. A heavily packed 1 or 2 bowls normally gets me pretty high. I’ll normally smoke 3-4 bowls to fall asleep. Only thing I don’t like is how the high doesn’t last as long as I prefer, but still an awesome strain. I wouldn’t say you get couch-locked with this one, unless your ...”"

SynLovely,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-cream/reviews/1365047,"“I love this strain. Tastes good, kinda tangy- takes away pain, stress, and depression. Really really makes me want to get up and move (I have a joint disorder that causes pain and moving is often difficult). Quite possibly my favorite strain thus far.”"

I was able to relax and feel good. Definitely one of my favorites! I think "hops" is a good description of the flavor.”"
