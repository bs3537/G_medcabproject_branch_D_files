EhEhRon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/area-51/reviews/1386849,"“House strain of Detroit's Area 51 dispensary. This citrus smelling strain is a go to of mine for back pain relief (high CBD) and an uplifting high.”"
that70sgranny,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/area-51/reviews/1377968,"“A very potent strain that is perfect for just about anytime of day. Very uplifting and perfect for depression because of how wonderful you feel. It is not too powerful so you keep a clear head. A very feel good strain!”"
Donald420Trump,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/area-51/reviews/1666654,"“This was my first time smoking A51 and let me tell you, it’s some straight gas! 1st) let start off with the buds; The smell is heaven to me! It’s extremely pungent, smell is really sour with earthy & diesel undertones. This bud is Beautiful! It literally look like its covered in sugar, very white a frosty and the little bit of green you can see is bright lime. I would consider this an exotic strain, at least here on ...”"
Redeye79,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/area-51/reviews/1436699,"“This had some negatives and positives. The taste was disgusting it had a very musky,earthy almost moldy taste like poorly cured bud.
The effects were very heady and satisfying. The appearance was amazing and the smell had a slight trace of citrus.
Overall the taste killed it for me to vape so I will have to turn it into butter and still be able to enjoy the effects.”"

This super rare Hybrid comes from unknown parents & a THC level of 20%. I felt happy, uplifted, lazy, & relaxed from these firm buds that were light green with some medium green. The buds were encrusted with fine crystal trichomes & had bright orange pistils. Scent & flavor was sweet, citrus, earthy, & floral. Smoke...”"

kush...kush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/area-51/reviews/1690361,"“Got this keeper strain at Good Meds.  I guess this strain is rare in Colorado so just hit up Good Meds if you want some.  My review here is after vaping 4 mildly-cloudy vapor hits with my tiny Vapcap and I figure I have about a medium tolerance at this time.  A51 is a tad sticky with green buds and orange/white tricomes.  It’s a creeper that peaks at about 20 min.  Smell is strong...the typical wonderful weed aroma.....”"

ThisIsArziki,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/area-51/reviews/1284161,"“og 


Smooth sweetening taste left on my tongue after each hit. This strain has the pungency of OG genetics minus the spicy exhale of the original. The buds are sparkled with trichomes beneath hints of purple nugs that are complimentary to its alluring looks. Though background lineage is unknown, I'd guess it derived from a haze because of its hair pattern.”"
