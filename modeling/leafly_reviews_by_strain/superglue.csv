Well, this was an impulse purchase. And i'm glad for it. Usually, my delivery service has a rounded selection of good kind. Its pretty consistent. And every so often, they carry some new stuff that I haven't come across to sample. Today was one of those days. And Super Glue was the mismatched sock that stood out. I mean the name sounds powerful. But I've b...‚Äù"

ajr819,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superglue/reviews/1396407,"‚ÄúThis high was instant, great, and long lasting. My husband and I love smoking this and going on strolls through Berkeley. This is a relaxing, euphoric, and humorous strain. Everything rolls off the shoulders, leaving the user feeling relaxed, but not sleepy. This is one of my new favorite strains. It is testing at 28% at the CBCB in Berkeley as of 2/17‚Äù"
mrsannarbor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superglue/reviews/1415905,"‚ÄúBy far, my all time favorite.   The 'Glue' always works.  Never lets me down.  Sometimes it takes a bit 4 my body to adjust to a new strain.  Never with this. Superlative. The bomb. Can't live without. Are just a few things that come to mind with the Glue.  I cannot recommend this strain highly enough.  It's dynamite.  If it's possible to be 'in love' with a plant, well, count me in.‚Äù"

cretin71,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superglue/reviews/1456473,"‚ÄúSmells wonderful, and tastes great. When smoked from a spoon pipe -- which is how I've consumed it --
 it tastes mostly sweet, with earthy, woody and piney tones in the background. Good stuff.

This strain's effects remind me a bit of Gorilla Glue. Like Gorilla Glue, Superglue starts off with a head high. It's not as racy as Gorilla Glue, though. Superglue is clear-headed and very happy for the first 30 minutes or so...‚Äù"

It's flavor and smoke is light and smooth, doesn't choke me up. The high is happy and hyper for me, once I start talking on this bud I can't stop. I smoke this before I go do P90 X regularly. As for preference this is exactly what I want a strain to do for me. It's perfect <3‚Äù"
Wolf_Wasp,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superglue/reviews/1325496,"‚ÄúAfter having gorilla glue #4, I decided an uptick in the indicated would do wonders. I definitely believe this gives more of a cbd/indica feel, it produces a slight spatial awareness impairment that's perfect for falling asleep or relaxing.

PrincessLeia1111,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superglue/reviews/1685492,"‚ÄúLoved this strain. It is fantastic for a relaxing (but not overly sedating) after-dinner smoke.  The cashier at my local pot store highly recommended this strain (grown by House of Cultivar), and he could not have been more right about how awesome it was! 
The odd thing was, when I asked the pot store clerk about the parents of Superglue, a manager quickly chimed in, without missing a beat "Gorilla Glue and Gelato 45...‚Äù"

QGQUE,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superglue/reviews/1672251,"‚ÄúThe Mind, Body, and Soul are nurtured by this strain. Aromatic fragrance of pungent earth, sweet work possibly a dash of honey. The body pains are dramatically eased. The feeling emotionally is balanced. It's helps with my PTSD/anxiety, lower/ upper back pain, with release of some muscle tension and cerebral relaxation.‚Äù"

I saw that is was a hybrid between two powerful, highly recommended indicas, but when smoking Superglue, it gave me the effects one would expect from a sativa. Not a good strain before bed.

The lineage seems to be the same, but my stuff leaves you with the biggest couch-lock I‚Äôve ever experienced. Funny enough though, it‚Äôs not a great sedative, so I have to pull myself off the couch to have something else to put me to sleep.

sherrrracha,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superglue/reviews/1727070,"‚ÄúAwesome strain! I‚Äôd like to compare the body high feeling similar to an edible.

Trizzlepuffs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superglue/reviews/1691686,"‚ÄúOf all of the strains I reviewed recently, it came as no surprise to me that Superglue would be the stinkiest of the bunch. Stinky in a good way, of course. When I opened up my sample an earthy, and very skunky aroma wafted out. In varying shades of green, the soft, squeezable, and lightly sticky texture, and the orange hairs thrown in for good measure on the bud all built my excitement to try this new strain.  Too, ...‚Äù"

knownotno,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/superglue/reviews/1760565,"‚ÄúThis has a nice pungeant skunks smell. The strain is pretty strong. 

I prefer the vaporizing effects as I have more control over delivery with a low heat for the terpenes at first followed by a harder pull with more heat.

This was a small pre-roll cone & I never felt paranoid or anything, but too much can leave you dizzy with a bit of nausea from the BP lowering effects.
