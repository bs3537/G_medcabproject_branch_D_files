Very energetic and happy high from the sativa side yet with no grandiose euphoria: very giggly and innocent kind of high. I'm high right now and everything is making me laugh, hahahaha.

ShrikerShadow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry/reviews/1413672,"‚ÄúVery nice strain. I was able to choose my high: to just ride the high and have fun or to function normally if need be. Pretty dense buds, visually appealing, and light smell pre-smoke. While smoking I definitely felt the head high while it relaxed my body, de-stressed my mind, and made me feel all around better. When riding the high I got hungry, was very relaxed, and just wanted to sleep after a while. When choosing...‚Äù"

nickidoobie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry/reviews/1384659,"‚ÄúOne of my favorite indica strains! Knocks you off your feet completely into a new experience with yourself. Creative, relaxed, and couch lazy. Best indica to use if you want to end your night with a great baked spiritual, personal, and body high experience. I recommend taking this before bed time to treat yourself after a hard day of work.‚Äù"
BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry/reviews/1411066,"‚ÄúBlackberry is a strain that can be enjoyed anytime of day.  The taste is smooth and sweet, it's fairly unique.  As for effects I've seen this strain range around the mid 20 percentile mark and it hits like it.  At smaller doses you'll be bubbly, on the go, and able to function.  While at larger doses you may be comfortably couched locked trying to remember what you had for lunch.  Either way Blackberry is a very enjo...‚Äù"
silasbotwin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry/reviews/1413130,"‚ÄúGot the strain crossed with OG Chem, it was superb! Super sweet taste and smell, immediate effects in the mind, thick body buzz hangs around longer, about an hour after the sativa begins to slow it's course. A great strain on it's own, but Blackberry Chem OG is one of the best buds I've smoked in over 5 years.‚Äù"
CynthiaLizette,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry/reviews/1384660,"‚ÄúAwesome. This took care of my headaches.  It pretty much numb it up until my high was gone. But overall it's great. Slight berry taste at the end too‚Äù"
MyRage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry/reviews/1384662,"‚ÄúWonderful strain.  Works very well for relaxation, muscle fatigue, and spasms.  The only down side is the 'one toke over the line' issue.  Two or three hits is enough to stop a rhino.  Anything beyond that will just put you in a staring coma.  Don't even think about reaching for the remote.  It's just too far away...

ateliergravitas,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry/reviews/1384661,"‚ÄúI bought two grams of some Blackberry - the last bit they had at The Humboldt County Collective, actually - and loved it to bits and pieces. The buds were incredibly frosted and gleaning with beautiful purple leaves. Really beautiful buds; I wish I could provide pictures. The strength of the Blackberry was pretty nice and potent, very indica-based and good for nighttime medication.‚Äù"
Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry/reviews/1384663,"‚ÄúIt must really depend on how it was grown. I got this strain in small bud form at Alternatives in Santa Rosa and I have not found any herb that I like better. It is smooth and has a definite blackberry after-taste. I am on dialysis and it really helped my nausea. I felt young again. Thank you Alternatives you guys are amazing.‚Äù"
vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry/reviews/1384664,"‚Äú4.5 stars. I started with half my usual first dose, and my pain went from 8 down to 2! (out of 10). It took a few minutes to come on. Very euphoric yet clear headed, and I did get a bit yawn-y after about 20 minutes. My second dose eliminated pain but motivate me to the mattress.  Smell and taste are just as described.‚Äù"

This strain can lean either way and I believe I tried the Indica-dom pheno-type, because the cerebral high was short lived, but my body felt wonderful. I'm not prone to soreness or injuries, but who gets mad at a prolonged and warm body high. Nice sweet smoke produced and the cerebral portion is nearly instantaneous.
