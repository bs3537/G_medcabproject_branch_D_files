High thc% ...did I mention freaking gorgeous?! Smells veryyyy lemony. Ok on to the smoke...smooth and tasty, 2 puffs and my stresses melt away. Highly recommend. I got mine at Herbal Wellness Center.”"
Mike18040,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonhead-og/reviews/1384741,"“Very nice flower with an awesome head and body high.  I can still function very well while using this strain.  I don't couch lock and it doesn't wipe me out like some other indica hybrids.  Works well with pain and melts any anxiety away.  Definitely one of my favorites.”"

Heard someone in the dispensary waiting room raving about it, so I purchased an eighth.  I'll probably go back for more.  If you were upset about something you will absolutely forget what it was!  This one had a fairly high THC and zero cbd so the sativa side was intense, in that you are very...”"

slothBOP,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonhead-og/reviews/1414409,"“Lemonhead OG is definitely a good sativa dominate hybrid! It gives you this focused, uplifted and euphoric sativa high with a nice indica relaxed kick to it but not overwhelming that will get you couch locked. The flavor has this very fresh floral like taste to it that is very smooth with a pungent sweet lemon smell that taste exactly like a lemonhead with piney and earthy undertones. Perfect for daytime use”"

I will say my tolerance is really low and that a whole gram was maybe too much to fully function, but the people I hung out with are heavy smokers and also loved it. Your experience may vary from mine.”"

Great motivational high when consuming during the day time.

This zesty lemon minty strain is truly one of a kind. It's wonderful for depression, in aromatherapy lemon keeps the blues away making it an extra dose of anti depressant power!
Right now I'm using it to help me relax before bed.”"

Dastomba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonhead-og/reviews/1572628,"“I will agree with some of the people who’ve already said it’s more of an Indica heavy hybrid. That said, this is a very good pain med and will give you the giggles if you let it. Good even head/body high. The “bud-tender” recommended this strain and I’m glad he did THC of 23% and very smooth smoke compared to some other lemony tasting flower out there. Will definitely get more of this in the future. Enjoy!”"
