planezoverlamez,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1479222,"“The perfect strain is for insomnia. I’m a heavy smoker with a high tolerance picked up some of this shatter, one hit before bed and I’m out. Wish it came around more often. So sweet in taste too.”"
kingcropper,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1532574,"“zombie kush is one of the most medically benifical strains ive smoked, if your looking for some knock out one two punch bud then this is for you. highly recommended strain for seasoned smokers as the high lasts a few hours and it can really zombify you if over do it.”"
wesrk1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1551855,"“Strong heady taste, very aromatic. Intense catatonic buzz. I’m a heavy user with a massive tolerance level, this dropped me for a good hour. If pic loads, you’ll see the beautiful crystals on the bud.”"

Franco153,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1552425,"“This may be my new favourite weed. Never seen it in a coffeeshop here in Holland but grew it myself last year. Had to harvest a bit early due to top rot but damn, never seen so much chrystals on a bud before. Taste was quite unique, can't really compare it to anything I've smoked before. Very heavy stuff. Very potent. Total migraine killer, when I smoked it at the onset of a heavy migraine it would totally crush it a...”"
ismann,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1606585,"“I've grown Zombie Kush a few times and it is very good. Very easy to grow, thick and bushy with above average yields.

Effect is very calming and stony. Definitely my favorite strain to zone out and watch the Rays lose every night.”"

Djfuche,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1745889,"“This strain is absolute spot on to its name. This is one is perfect for those rainy days and Netflix. Got this from chronickkushco.ca can’t go wrong with these guys ever. Best selection around 😁🔥”"
Cannasquisher,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1520843,"“I bought some beautiful buds that tested only 10% THC and squished a few grams on a 2-ton rosin press. My yield at 200F was 10% which was about what I expected. What I didn't anticipate was the complex terp profile and remarkably potent effects of a small dab of rosin. I believe this strain's trichome factories manufacture less THC but more terps. The effect is uniquely potent and tasty.”"

skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1752900,"“This is the best high I've experienced in awhile. A deep, earthy taste and smell... hit me immediately and by the end of the joint, my whole body was tingling and I was giggling. Currently a heavy stoned feeling, squinty eyed, with a buzz through my whole body. If you see Zombie Kush, get it. (got this in WA from High State Growers)”"
Dante8829,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1768619,"“one of the most chill strain i had ever had.
very smooth & welcoming flavor also has a earthy pungent smell.
if i had to be left alone on a deserted island with one herb this be the one.”"
spectorbcn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1724435,"“Zombie is an appropriate name for this strain, when I use it I am a complete zombie for the rest of the day, heavy heavy indica, couch lock, munchies, if you've got insomnia look no further..”"

He could barely keep his eyes open.. best indica for insomnia and anxiety!!! Highly recommend.”"
Tmantra,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1725934,"“For post concussion syndrome and getting some sleep it works great.  It also makes my head work better and I have less fatigue.

KyleFromVanIsle,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zombie-kush/reviews/1788677,"“Look: Sage-coloured knarly, knotted buds dusted with orange snow. Really nice

Smell: A bit earthy but intensity jumps once you start chopping some up. 

Taste before Ignition: "Air" toke says midly sweet mixed with earthy flavour. 

Toke Taste: Rich smoke, has the trait of a resinous strain and it flirted with making me cough like Kush strains can do (ever notice how much more stoned you feel after a coughing fit?)
