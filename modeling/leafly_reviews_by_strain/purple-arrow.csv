The first time I tried Purple Arrow I had nerve pains shooting down my neck into my upper back. After the first drag the pain was gone, and I could still function at about 90%. Everything else I've tried hits so fricking hard I can't even think. With G.G. or P.A. I can spend time enjoying the smoking aspect of medic...”"

1.  Purple Arrow - Like it's name suggests it targets pain very quickly, and you can still mow the lawn or paint a portrait immediately after medicating.  No real plateau, and no need to smoke into oblivion.  Slightly lower in THC than most strains these days, and that's fine with me.  Also very productive.
