Breadstick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummy-bears/reviews/1385845,"“This stuff is SUPER potent. Just picked some up in Anchorage Alaska from Alaska Fuzzy Budz, with a THC % of 32.8! I was blown away when I saw the THC levels and this strain certainly does deliver. One rip off a pre-roll had all of us super blazed. It hits the mouth heavy and leaves almost a numbness of the mouth due to how strong it is. The flavor to me was reminiscent of gummybears, but almost had a kind of sharp so...”"
BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummy-bears/reviews/1399355,"“Grabbed some of this while visiting the Olympic peninsula.  W.A.

I would describe the taste as an earthy, sweetness with floral notes that linger on the exhale.  The buds smell of sweet candy but it didn't carry over into the flavor so much.  As far as effects go this was a balanced hybrid. Relaxing, easy to hold conversation on.  Found ourselves rambling on and on.  The buds I got tested at 21.5% THC,  and were rat...”"
ColoradoParanoidPain,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummy-bears/reviews/1426106,"“Very nice tingle tingle buzz in my chest and abdominal area. I'm susceptible to paranoia and anxiety but this strain didnt trigger this in smaller doses at all. Helped with pain a little, made me happy an uplifted. 
Just a bit of a heavy fog feeling on the brain and eyes. Not to debilitating. In my top ten.”"

UnknownGerman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummy-bears/reviews/1500348,"“This strain is straight up HEAT. You get the tingly Blue Dream feeling, alongside with a nice productive high. It's great for a day-smoker, but it also makes you completely relaxed and overall more happy. The cottonmouth is also not as bad as I thought it would be. If you get a chance to, try this strain. 10/10 recommended.”"

Ronson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummy-bears/reviews/1385846,"“Just sampled some 28℅ gummy bears.  Dense stony indica.  Og dominant...very earthy, not much sweetness at all.”"
MitchellandFinese,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummy-bears/reviews/1495199,"“A very relaxing high. Perfect for just before bed to help induce sleep. Taste isn’t half bad. Would for sure grab again when in stock.”"
Daniel_esp_,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummy-bears/reviews/1709140,"“Enjoyed the high very much. Vaporized when consumed and it induces a relaxed head and body high. would recommend to anyone with lots of stress, great for before bed.”"
JoySters,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummy-bears/reviews/1753931,"“This is a surprisingly intense flower. The three times it has been ingested ... it has hit slowly but then comes on quite hard and then goes into a very intense experience verging on an internally psychedelic experience. It also brings on sleep rather quickly as it wears off. Not a casual bud for my person, but much appreciated.”"

It was very sticky and dense but it burned in a weird way. Left an unpleasant smell lingering in the air. It wasn't chemically though, as there was no crackle of any sort to the burn. It was a very smooth smoke with a satisfying enough potency. Bit of a paranoid high. I actua...”"

At first I thought it was just a tiny pre-roll that cost too much and was obviously geared toward gullible tourists. Having no mobile coverage in Alaska, I couldn't look up anything about the strain and just figured it was yet another tourist trap: Let's call it something cute and get all those gen x'ers. Three pulls later a...”"

It’s not often that I smoke bud that’s a creeper. The smell didn’t really carry over it as it was super earthy but berry-ish smell to it and the taste is really earthy. It takes a while for the high to build intensity and then once it gets going, it’s like a train. But I’ve found that this is also very euphoric strain that left me very tal...”"

DerekParker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummy-bears/reviews/1618996,"“Rolled a nice blunt into some hemp wrapper. First few hits are strong and powerful! Nice relaxation going on, pain levels and stress levels down! Much happier than i was 10 minutes ago! Def a great powerful strain for daytime even. You can feel the indica relaxing you but the sativa is def doing its job as well! Great hybrid like a girl scout cookie!”"

The only effects I felt were feeling a bit sleepy about 30 minutes later. This strain was a complete waste of money for me because it didn't do anything or my depression, did not uplift my mood and did not leaving me feel carefree as described. If you have a higher THC tolerance, this strain wi...”"
MarcVet,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gummy-bears/reviews/1399356,"“These gummy bears were just what I needed.  I was a little skeptical at first but followed the advice of the good gentleman at Natures Medicine (McDowell Rd).  He told me to eat just one and wait for a good little while and then I'd know how to adjust in the future.  To my surprise those little gummies had some power.  I believe it was the Baked Bros brand.  All I can say is wow, and one of the first great nights of ...”"
