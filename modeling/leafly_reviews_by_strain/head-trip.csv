hazywings,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/head-trip/reviews/1384413,"“Not a very common strain. The cerebral effects are priceless. A truly enjoyable head high associated with this, and it accompanies a very relaxing body high. Great hybrid.”"
SadieBashes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/head-trip/reviews/1385232,"“The high you get from this strain is wonderful. It's so far from overwhelming. I don't know if I'm the only one,but I was REALLY put off by the taste. To me, it was like smoking black coffee grounds. maybe it's just me :p”"
