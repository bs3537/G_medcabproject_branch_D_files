Honey Rock
=============
HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-rock/reviews/1416450,"“As with most Honey strains I found this hybrid to be Indica leaning,  it's a pleasant high to just relax with.”"
Illmindofmine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/honey-rock/reviews/1690117,"“Not perfect, but a really chill strain to smoke after working or doing a lot in a day. Awesome way to chill out without the heavy stoney feeling. Easy to wake up the next day but makes you super lazy when you smoke it.”"
