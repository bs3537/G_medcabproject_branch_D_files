Al's Dream
=============
sgm8,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/als-dream/reviews/1361943,"“Wouldn't recommend for anyone who has problems with anxiety. I'd never had a panic attack after smoking weed until I smoked Al's Dream. Not sure if it was fully the fault of the strain or what but I definitely will not be trying this strain again”"
KittyHaze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/als-dream/reviews/1330360,"“I enjoyed this strain.   It mad me very social and talkative. My hubby was surprised cause I'm quite, but I wasn't shutting up. 😊 very uplifting.”"
NicholasRichards,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/als-dream/reviews/1358312,"“I grew a similar cross from seed of a male Albert's Haze and a blue dream female. Even though I had to harvest prematurely, I still got a couple ounces of amazing Weed. I'm a lover of BD and the strain I had was a great hybrid of a great hybrid.”"
