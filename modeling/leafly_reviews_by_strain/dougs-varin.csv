helloitsmehi,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dougs-varin/reviews/1399333,"“Got some concetrate after reading about it. I suffer PTSD and mixed anxiety that keeps me at home a lot.  It is, by far, the greatest medication I have ever experienced. I found myself on the phone, out and about, uplifted, truly happy. It's a shame it's so hard to find as it is unlike any strain I have ever had. Body energy, mentally alert, clear headed and it feels like a care free sunny day in late spring. EVERY d...”"
badgeese,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dougs-varin/reviews/1519828,"“Loads of energy, racing thoughts, but very clear headed, without any of the mental fogging weed usually produces.  
If I didn't know this was weed I might have thought it was some sort of amphetamine.  
I was happy, excited, and felt like I wanted to go out and have an adventure.
Most cannabis makes me a relaxed sort of happy, but I would describe this as manic, self-satisfied, almost smug.
There was some body high, ...”"

The effects were mainly increased sense of well being, lessened anxiety, decreased interest in food, increased interest in activity and creative output.  Perfect for when I needed to mellow out and destress while remaining functional and actively engaged... ideal for work, daytime medicating, and even balancin...”"

woodlandbunny,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dougs-varin/reviews/1526811,"“Very clear headed. I was starting to have a panic attack and vaped some concentrate. Amazingly the panic totally stopped. Usually I'd reach for Xanax but that makes me tired so sometimes I just suffer through the attack to avoid being sleepy and non-clear headed. It like nothing I've ever tried before. If you suffer from panic attacks, this is wonderful. Also, it's a very fun and upbeat strain. Amazing”"

Woodland Bunny or Bad Geese if you could let me know where you recently  got it I would greatly appreciate it. I have several, ailments I want to try to treat with this strain. All other efforts to find high concentrations of THCV strains have come up empty. I am in Nor Cal. Many thanks all. I will drive as far as I need to in order to get some.”"

KennyMBHS,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dougs-varin/reviews/1720738,"“Incredible!  I took a single hit from my friend's vape cartridge before our dinner party, and I would describe almost similar to a cocaine high. I was energized, talkative and highly focused.  Different than any pot I've had over the past 40 years.  I am usually not the biggest talker in groups of people, just average, but I captivated everyone!  And about 5 minutes into eating my meal, the food in my mouth all of th...”"
