Nice body tingle and a bit of a head high with some focus. Overall a nice strain thats just being explore.”"

JamaicaMeLol,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tigermelon/reviews/1465156,"“Decent terpine profile and bag appeal. If you have none, or not much experience with medicating, this is for you. Effects are very mild. Works well as a mood enhancer. Falls short pertaining to pain alleviation, appetite stimulation, or sleeplessness.”"
MisMe,https://www.leafly.com/indica/tigermelon/reviews/1457917,"“I literally just smoked my anger away. It allowed my to calm down to clearly think about the situation. Kinda hazey in the head, nice body buzz. I am completely relaxed right now, no anxiety feels good.”"
