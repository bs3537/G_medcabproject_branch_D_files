By far the most powerful I have had so far yet since getting my MMJ card, I was having such an intense focus and head rush followed by extreme giggling and relaxation. This strain takes about 3 minutes to hit you like a train, and will drive you sky high all while making your head feel like a bowling ball. I recommend this strain to anybody that's ...”"

A great choice for a morning off...relieved anxiety without making me feel sleepy...but also a solid choice for nighttime if you're looking to relax and maybe play with a creative project or two.  Love how this indica dominant leaves my mind clear and calmed at the same time.  Thank you Kimbo ...”"

The smell was like a vanilla cookie followed by an earthy scent.  Really liked the smell and taste.  The high was great!.  Not a hard mind high but comfortable, relaxing and superb body high.  If insomnia is a concern Kimbo is ideal.  First time in a long time I had an uninterrupted night sleep.”"
Hati,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kimbo-kush/reviews/1172571,"“Damn good. Pleasant taste that's woodsy but with slight tart kush taste right at the end. Clean buzz in small doses, isn't bad before heavy gym work out. You will, however, likely forget how long you've been in there. In heavy doses you get that punch-

I have to say, it wasn't my favorite kush variety, the flavor was kind of piney and it hit pretty harsh, but the feeling it gave me reminded me of being a teenager smoking pot on the train tracks. Just mildly anxious enough to know you're baked and a full body buzz that lasts. 

Good quality, good high, taste was so-so.”"
