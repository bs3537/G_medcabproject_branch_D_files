sirgavofgreensmoke,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/exodus-cheese/reviews/1378665,"“this isn't the original cheese, or even the one favoured by the exodus collective, which remains 'clone only' to this day. 

 the real deal has a taste as strong as the smell, and it's the fruitiest thing this side of blueberry, but considerably more potent and so deserves respect; it's caused more 'whiteys' than any other strain in the uk, and takes a while to get used to.

 the biggest problem is that funky sme...”"

The buds are a beautiful lime kinda green that smell absolutely insane! This is one of if not THE Fruitiest smelling buds I have ever smelled.

If u find a good breed, only a small/normal j of your standards will make u just high enough for 2-3 hours, which is great for daytime!
