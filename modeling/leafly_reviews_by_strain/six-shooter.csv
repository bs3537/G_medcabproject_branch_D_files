IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/six-shooter/reviews/1418503,"“Super dense but as you break it up its true trichome content gets revealed along with complex sweet scent with notes of many of its parent strains, sweet skunky citrus pine at least. It's almost like there is just too much going on here though to be honest.”"
