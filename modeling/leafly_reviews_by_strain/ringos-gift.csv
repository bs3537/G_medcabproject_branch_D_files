There's a lot going on in there and my ankle is inflamed and painful. I'm not able to take NSAIDs and I don't really like the risks of taking acetaminophen. I decided to try cannabis to relieve pain and to help with my mood as this much pain also has a great impact...”"

When the muscle spasticity gets really bad, one bowel and you can feel your body unwind almost immediately. This is a body relief strain so not a lot of head change.

Light fluffy flower, smoked super easy even with a slightly raspy throat (no coughing), Before I got halfway through the bowl my shoulder tension, rib spasms and general pain were GONE!! 

Long live CBD!”"

You do get the familiar relaxed and mellow feelings associated with CBD, but you can get a bigger bang for your buck elsewhere. I don't have any debilitating physical pains, but as someone who appreciates both a mellow physical high as well as a head-trip, I can say I still won't be entertaining this strain again.”"
