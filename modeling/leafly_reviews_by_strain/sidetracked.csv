Sidetracked
=============
JazztobaccOG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sidetracked/reviews/1568583,"“Despite its name, Sidetracked gives a wonderfully focused, buzzing sativa high. Spicy and complex terpene profile with overtones of diesel. 
The THC numbers are definitely in the high 20s on this one. 
Overall it has great taste, energetic high and long lasting effects, I would recommend for any flower enthusiast!”"
