OCWeedReview,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/maui-wowie/reviews/1099692,"“I’ve been on a bit of a tropical themed run here as of late, and Maui Wowie, often seen as Maui Waui, adds to this ongoing motif.  After enduring a month in frigid Chicago and getting to know the term polar vortex well, I’ve been spending as much time under the palm trees of SoCal as possible.  It isn’t the taste, but the spirit of this strain that makes me think of warm, sunny beaches and bathing suits.
