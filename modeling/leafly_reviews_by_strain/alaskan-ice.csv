=============
LostTechnique,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaskan-ice/reviews/1412477,"“One of those strains that are so potent you can go to sleep for 8 hours and still feel buzzed when you wake up. Absolutely great for daytime use. Very little anxiety and it gave me the giggles with a grin that just wouldn't go away. In higher doses it rushes behind your eyes and gives a feeling of bliss and euphoria with an almost numbing body high but still very functional. Also it seemed very good for social events...”"

Does It make you feel like you're trying natures candy for the first time? And now,you can't find it anywhere and you were too stupid to buy more than a gram? This strain! The strain that knocked my socks off. Impeccable smoothness that's matched well with its flavorful trichome covered mound of forestry brisk 0 To 60 in 1.2 seconds = PURE BLI...”"

Gelle,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaskan-ice/reviews/1416873,"“A very euphoric, energetic high. It has a very quick on-set, so you don't need to smoke this strain too long to get a nice, happy buzz going. Extremely cranial high for me, and even made my eyes tingly and dry. Excellent for defeating bad times and stressful situations. Be wary of smoking too much at once, as it is incredibly potent.”"

gloryhaze,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaskan-ice/reviews/1351340,"“I want to like Alaskan Ice, it seemed promising for a sativa. But sadly it fails to deliver. 
More like a very weak Harlequin. 
It shows a very high THC output on the stats, but the actual effect never makes it quite there for me. 
So if you are looking for the workout smoke or the anti depression day smoke, this would be more the bottom of the barrel, buy it if there is no Cenex.”"
Tfrye,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaskan-ice/reviews/1360939,"“Alaskan Ice is a clear, brain fruit minty high. It's straight to the point and has a great taste. Big fan of white widow and this strain just gave it a good twist.”"
Chimaera,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaskan-ice/reviews/1348708,"“Vaped three volcano bags, 6, 7.5, 9, hit well and strongly. I got massive tunnel vision and dry eyes, shoveled some snow and hear rate shot up like crazy. Pretty heavy limbs too.”"

sdsmith0889,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaskan-ice/reviews/1349707,"“This strain has a very light taste yet it suites how smooth this smoke is. Giving a good high that makes me feel light and tingly. I find it does not obstruct my thought processes. Some slight dry mouth and appetite increase along with distorted periphreals when zoning out.”"

yelafingaz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaskan-ice/reviews/1348716,"“This strain is fast and hard-hitting with a very euphoric lift to mood. A calm high without being tunnel-minded or couch-locky, this helped with chronic lower back pains and common aches of a chef's daily beatings. Major munchies, but also major energy-booster, this is my new favorite strain.”"

Potent sativa leaning hybrid that gives a nice body buzz and isn't racy at all while still having strong clear headed cerebral effects. Leaves you with upbeat energy to take on the day while it distracts you from pains and negativity. Has a sweet earthy scent with a complex undertone that I find hard to pin down, seems to range from almost mint to spicy to fruity, but mostly just sweet c...”"
tornadoze,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/alaskan-ice/reviews/1360940,"“It's a great child strain of White Widow. I definitely feel the euphoric buzz. I exhibit some stereotypical stoner effects such as slight munchies, dry mouth, and giggles. I really like it! It's got a great, kind of... fresh smell. Really doesn't smell like weed, more like menthol potpourri. It smokes very smoothly through a water pipe with cold water and ice catch. It's great for focusing on studying.”"

LOVE this in the morning to get moving. Great during the day when you just need a little focus and energy, and even great at night when you just want to chill in front of the tv. Won’t keep you up but won’t put you to bed. Minty tasty. Yum!”"

I really enjoyed it while out in nature! I felt a lot of positive introspection, and improved mood. It came in huge nugs, that where frosted in trichomes. It has a very pungent aroma too, that's kind of earthy with menthol. If I see it, I'll get again for sure!”"
