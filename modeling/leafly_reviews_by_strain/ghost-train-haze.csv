Ghost Train Haze
=============
John18,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/ghost-train-haze/reviews/1417693,"“Just smoked 1/2 half of a joint of Ghost Train Haze, and it's definitely got me thinking.  I'm thinking that I have a new favorite Sativa strain to pass on to you and my close friends.  I say "close" friends because I'm stashing some of it for the "special" times when I want to smoke  a very strong Sativa that will pull off the "Stun-Gun" effect on my head while I sit there and think deep thoughts.
It will leave you ...”"

I'm leaving you. Because, I never imagined I would,  but I found someone better, for me. ...my soul mate. Ghost train haze is everything you had to offer and more. Don't worry though, I'll be back because this dream, this haze, is something most people just wouldn't understand. And the ghost whispers you off to sleep. Without having to have your granddaddy get the purple hammer out. Love. Me. Love  ...”"

this is now my favorite strain of all time.
- 10*/10*  
- smooth smoke
- great taste
- low smell
- hits fast and hard!
- lasts a good 2-2.5 hours 
- totally functional 
- good party strain”"

Seriously.

I was first intrigued by this train long before I ever saw it in a dispensary - it won the 2014 Cannabis cup; and, unlike 2015, in which Denver was NOT represented, this strain is a native to Colorado. It's somewhat difficult to find as I've only seen it in one dispensary, and it is rarely cheap from what I have seen from other places. It's entirely worth it. Read on.

He recommended this and blackberry kush, both demolished the pain & both had me grinning like a Cheshire Cat. So glad he talked me into this one!

Everytime you crack open the jar you take a big whiff.”"

Started off with mild buzz and then the Ghost Train hit me.  I think they call it the ghost train haze because it's silent and invisible and it hits you like a train, and the first effect is feeling wobbly or dizzy.  Careful on taking too many hits because you "don't feel it yet".  This train will catch up to you.  Starts off with insane feeling sensory amplification.  Drinking a dr. pepp...”"
