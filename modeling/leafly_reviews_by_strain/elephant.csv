Couldn't quit vacuuming and cleaning the house while in deep thought lol If you get your hands on some it won't be the Elephant in the room. Zing see how I did that?”"
Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/elephant/reviews/1396964,"“Aloha! when I heard this strain is believed to originate in Hawaii i had to try it.  Real happy, feeling creative, and energy is pretty good overall. not too speedy but definitely a Sativa high with just a bit of spacey/stoney vibes.”"
FNizzle31,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/elephant/reviews/1382897,"“Picked up some Elephant produced by Sunshine Farms here in WA, and just couldn't be happier with it!! Taste and smell are great, not too harsh on the throat, and had an enjoyable and productive high. I sometimes have anxiety, especially in social situations, but this made me happy to bs with everyone around! My go-to sativa at the moment!!”"

KWGriff,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/elephant/reviews/1800156,"“Wow, what a different high for me. I vaped some flower, the THC was around 17% and all I can say is Wow! and that about what I remember. The high was very heady for me, I was very euphoric and as my wife would say "a bit giggly". Made me think we were speaking telepathically, freaky right? A kind of "Did I say that out loud or was it in my head" moment. Here is the weed that's "like taking a trip without leaving the ...”"
pedobear,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/elephant/reviews/1392862,"“Worst strain I ever smoked, had to sell it to friend soon after I bought it and smoked some, no relaxation or body high whatsoever and could barely concentrate on any task. Would not recommend at all.”"
