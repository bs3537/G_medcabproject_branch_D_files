warpedcassette,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-chunk/reviews/1396835,"“This is a fantastic Sativa that is deceptively strong. The smells of its parents are quite strong, with the Cheese and PIneapple parents standing out in the scent. The unmistakable skunk is sort of a subtle background player on this one, and that's not necessarily a bad thing (since it allows the pineapple, in particular, to stand out).

Clearly indica effects, likely 300 mikes in 2 bags and still absolutely zero cerebral effect. Muscles relaxed, calm, content.”"

Best for a head high leaving you giggling and smiling for no reason, but there is a very immobilizing factor to it. Only down side is it leads to a large amount of munchies with a hint of paranoia. Overall not to bad”"

STICKY,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pineapple-chunk/reviews/1091238,"“The essence and flavor of Pineapple Chunk is immediately obvious. Its aroma of earthy Cheese X Skunk is backed up by a secondary scent of Pineapple. The taste is delicious and unique. Earthy flavors are underpinned by a strong tasty Pineapple aftershock. A massive THC output and high CBD gives a powerful couch lock effect.
80% Indica
20% Sativa”"
