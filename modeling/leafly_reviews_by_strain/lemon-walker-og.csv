Extremely pungent....like a skunk; eating an orange, resting in a field of lemon peels. The high is very uplifting and relaxing, without being to sedative. Surprisingly, it doesn't taste anything like it smells. It tastes more like O.G. than anything. The mood lift is quite noticeable, giddy at times with an overall positive sense of well being. Highly recommended. Myrcene...”"

This tastes like a lemon filled pastry.  Seriously.  Smooth tasty smoke and immediate effects after exhale.  I've been rather depressed lately and this made me laugh for hours.  Lasts a few hours and I ordered more immediately after the first delivery was tried.”"
StateofMorgan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-walker-og/reviews/1387691,"“Now this stuff...this stuff is the writer's strain. It combines a pleasant, subtle body high with potent thoughts that hit with speed and focus. You can easily stay on task, even as all the other possibilities are arrayed in front of you, there for you to pluck from as you choose. And when you tell yourself the story, whatever that story is, you do it with eloquence, depth, and grace. Smoke some, sit down, put pen to...”"

nebguy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-walker-og/reviews/1387681,"“Lemon Walker gives me a clean, happy, relaxed high with no downsides.  It causes neither jitteryness nor sedation, nor does it put me to sleep.   The smoke is mild flavored and not irritating.  It's exactly what I want, and it's as good as I've tried.”"

jaxanthony23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-walker-og/reviews/1568770,"“This strain is one of my favorite medicinally benefitted strains. Headache reliever, great for sore muscles, and enhances creativity and boost mood. The experiences are all different. Sometimes it’s a very euphoric fatigue reliever or an anxiety reliever for the night time before bed. A very potent strain that has a citrus-like flavor and a very fruity aroma. When broken up in the middle the smell becomes stronger wi...”"

4 weeks curing and the lemon 🍋 is coming out (jar, bowl, vape, J).  Smokes super smooth, citrus in, earthy out.
High is perfect for me for daytime use.  Energized me when I have things to do from work to piddling around the house/yard.  A nice pleasant high, keeps a grin 😏 on my face.

I really need to blaze a lot to lose motivation, which is great since I ...”"

MoonstoneConnection,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-walker-og/reviews/1387684,"“Wonderful buds. uplifting high energy with a smooth citrus taste. A new favourite of mine. Some of the most crystal I have seen!”"
IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-walker-og/reviews/1387690,"“Very heady with a calming body buzz that starts with that "headband" type effect and works its way down to the body. More of a daytime strain, seems to make my eyes open wider rather than close. Intense sweet citrusy scent I associate with space queen. Big, airy frosty buds. 4.5/5.”"

CannaM1Z,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-walker-og/reviews/1775218,"“I expected so much from a strain that comes from Skywalker OG. SkyWalker OG is my fav so I am really shocked that Lemon Walker is such a harsh smoke. I couldn't finish my bowl. Felt like I ran sandpaper down my throat, yet -- when I smoked Pie-95, it was as smooth as ice. 

Something is definitely off with Lemon Walker at Sira. At least to me.”"
stonedsoulpicnic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemon-walker-og/reviews/1385114,"“Three stars only for this one. Okay but definitely not top shelf for my tastes. An easy going mild strain. Would recommend for new users, but as always do the 3 toke test and wait ten minutes to avoid any unwanted surprises. Nice taste, smell, look going for it but didn't seem to do much beyond the initial immediate high that seemed to continue into a short (45 min) dizzying, mild memory loss with slight headache typ...”"

It’s amazing bud to look at and has a great lemon smell, never mind smoking it! The high is very uplifting and euphoric. It’s a very satisfactory strain for sure, highly recommended”"
