sonnygee20,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/scouts-honor/reviews/1629910,"‚Äúscouts honor has been the best hybrid I've had in a while. one of my top favorite strains hands down. Definitely one of the most potent strains. This strain personally helps me with loss of appetite and soreness after workouts. Great muscle relaxer to me honestly!‚Äù"
mredjay0,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/scouts-honor/reviews/1605688,"‚ÄúGreat strain for being relaxed and creative. HOWEVER....I'm not sure what it is, but this particular strain gives me the fear. Not every time I smoke mind you....sometimes it's really chill and relaxed..but then other times that Sativa comes through and gives me much too much of a cerebral effect. Tastes phenomenal though. Can be good, but don't forget she's a little Sativa as well.‚Äù"
kaylaajeann420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/scouts-honor/reviews/1627909,"‚ÄúThis strain is phenomenal! This perfect Stoney hybrid gets me lit every time. If you want a couch lock feeling with a good mental buzz this is a go to. The taste is very yummy and sweet with a mix of og.

jimmyinspazzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/scouts-honor/reviews/1667533,"‚ÄúEnjoyed this strain.  Smooth kush smoke with sweet doughy overtones starts out low key buzz working up to a pretty heavy high if enough is smoked. Flexible high that can be social or if enough of this bud is ingested a flat out stoned.  More netflix than knocked out. The flower is the cherry on top with beautiful dark purple cemented throughout an even deeper, darker green nugget of dense masterpiece.  Neat cannabis ...‚Äù"

uhsrslyguise,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/scouts-honor/reviews/1584027,"‚ÄúBeautiful frosty buds with dark and light greens peeking from behind the off-white trichomes. The full, mid-sized buds are densely packed, but light and fluffy when broken apart by hand.

The smell is really incredible. Definitely that kush odor that makes your mouth water and your jaw tingle when you first stick your nose in the jar. The taste on exhale is full and sweet, but a strong peppery spice at the end that h...‚Äù"
