obeytheelements,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avi-dekel/reviews/1417203,"“Since I have GAD I decided to give this strain a try. My Licensed Producer is MedReleaf. When I first opened the container a sweet, pungent smell hit my nose. My batch had 15% CBD and .89 % THC. It has a beautiful aroma and when vaporized it actually tastes a bit like sweet tarts. :) This strain effectively relieved my chronic pain from scoliosis and also calmed my anxious mind. There is no psychoactive effect from t...”"

High CBD through the day and this strain is changing lives. Mix it with some of your favourite smoke and reap the benefits! Assists with pain, inflammation, gastrointestinal issues, depression and overall well being.”"

I tried it and loved it at first for relaxation and the ability to get me to sleep.  Unfortunately,  after a few weeks,  it started to caused extreme anxiety which only got worse with continued use.  Eventually it started to cause depression.   It got to the point that it started to effect me so adversely that I had to stop using it.   I switched over to C...”"

This strain is good for improving your mood, muscle relaxation, and easing stress. It has a mild euphoric, clear headed and focused effect that is also good for taking the edge off of pain.  Mild buzz, no strong head high with this strain.”"

jowiko,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avi-dekel/reviews/1417209,"“I have severe chronic pain. Inflammation in my spine primarily, and after two days of trying this strain for the first time, there was a noticeable decrease in inflammation. As a result I am already off my daily Tylenol. I can't take anything else but that, not even NSAIDs. So finally having an alternative that's not taxing my liver is quite welcome.”"

Took away all my anxiety, pain, and neurotic tendencies. Not sleepy at all but so relaxed which is nice because I could see myself functioning on this while at work. Try it you won't regret it.”"

sticshifter,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avi-dekel/reviews/1363731,"“I like this strain first thing in the morning. Nothing heady although you feel it right away. Vaporizing is the way to go with this strain. A little on the pricy side.”"

I also have used this for times I hit a sativa and paranoia starts, this is a great strain/ tool to have.”"
IIJay,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avi-dekel/reviews/1493235,"“Avidekel is definitely a strain you should try if you want to get rid of pain / anxiety and don’t want to get high. For me, it was effective on pain and so-so with anxiety. My anxiety is better treated with strains like Harlequin.”"
zacktothefuturee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avi-dekel/reviews/1616741,"“Flower/ 2 hits

PROS: works surprisingly well for inflammation 
-doesn't get you high

CONS:
-smoke is harsh
-gave me a short term headache 
-brain felt foggy (not stoned)

It really helped with inflammation of my joints from rock climbing and my arthritis. You will still feel your joint pains but helped reduce it a lot. Harshness of smoke might be avoided by vape. The trade off of the headache is why I rate this a 3...”"

This is possibly the best cannabis strain. It is amazingly relaxing and calming. Has zero psychoactive effects.

vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avi-dekel/reviews/1361220,"“Like the other low THC high CBD strains, this one has mellow, calm, and slightly uplifting effects. Good pain relief, especially blended with a THC strain. Vapor is smooth, it was easy to finish the bowl. The effects creep up and last a long time.”"
Livin782,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avi-dekel/reviews/1485414,"“Best CBD strain I've tried. It might not be cheap, but the 25% discount i receive from Medreleaf is a huge help. This strain calms my anxiety, does wonders for my arthritis as well. Looking forward to vaping some, been smoking so far. No head high”"

I cannot believe how effective this Oil is for anti-inflammatory! I haven't seen my fingers this small in over three years! It relieves my nerves like nothing else, better than the CD #1 from Canntrust. I suffer from chronic pain and extreme anxiety and using this along with other strains has help me incredibly.

I love Avidekel, this is a plant that heals in a very positive way.
HIGHLY recommended if you suffer from the symptoms it addresses.”"
IlikeElephants,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avi-dekel/reviews/1410597,"“this strain is absolutely perfect. as a person that has occasional pain from kidney stones and social anxiety it works wonders.

If you want a slight high and about the same CBD content, Midnight is the way to go. Both are very nice strains. Keep in mind Avi-Dekel is more Sativa and Midnight is more Indica.”"

cinn7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/avi-dekel/reviews/1501136,"“Avidekel is actually a 60/40 Indica dominant hybrid. Leafly should update the site to reflect that. It works amazing for Insomnia, if you also have anxiety or overthink. You need to mix it with a pure Indica to get a knockout punch if you want to sleep. Just enough Avidekel to keep the mind from overthinking or freaking out from the Indica you mix it with. I usually mix it about 25/75 cbd/indica.”"

Having said that it's very effective for an anxiety relief. I felt myself having a panic attack coming on and I had little bit of my bud and I was just ready to go chill!

Fantastic strain for menstrual cramps!

I deal with a lot of mental health issues (and a few physical issues that stem from my mental health) and I find that this calms my mind but doesn’t leave me useless and couch locked. I would give it a 5 star review for that alone but I find the taste and smell incredibly off putting. I have mixed with my favourite tasty strain before but I find the a...”"
