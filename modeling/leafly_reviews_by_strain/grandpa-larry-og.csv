Hondo13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grandpa-larry-og/reviews/1396382,"“Great strain. Started off kind of racy and almost made me sick but after a bit it is a nice calming effect. Tastes nice but stinks to high heaven. This strain has a fruity skunk smell that is overpowering after smoking it.”"
bigsbug,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grandpa-larry-og/reviews/1396386,"“This strain is amazing. It helps with my severe digestive issues, joint pain and anxiety without being stuck to the couch.  It is relaxing but you can still get things done and if you don't you don't really care.  I wish more dispensaries carried this.  I waited over a year to find it and try it and it is not available in my area again.  Don't hesitated to give this a try you will not be sorry.”"

elkenny,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grandpa-larry-og/reviews/1715208,"“When I first smoked this, I didn't like it. I was into some dramatic Goji OG that would get me so wired & anxious that I kind of liked it. The high was extreme. I just regulated my dosage. When I smoked Grandpa, I wasn't impressed. The high was all right, but I didn't get wired. I thought this was sativa dominant strain, but after looking it up, it's clearly indica. Stupid me. I gotta tell you after a couple more ses...”"

LyanaSkyDweller,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grandpa-larry-og/reviews/1495243,"“Grandpa Larry is my favorite strain, super nice, does exactly what you'd want an indica to do. Super relaxing but not in a couch lock way. I can be active, exercise, do chores, art or just chill watching tv. Anything you might want to do this strain gets you hyper focused on, including if you wanna sleep you can drop off immediately.”"
MitchellandFinese,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grandpa-larry-og/reviews/1583315,"“So I got this strain by accident thinking that it was the normal Larry OG but advertised as an indica(silly me). However, when I puffed on this strain I felt instant relief and it almost feels like everything just melted away. A nice body high but I’m still attentive.”"
ochristi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grandpa-larry-og/reviews/1354502,"“I'm really not about Indicas in general and this strain is a good example of why. The body effects are great, no headaches, great relaxation, but just couch-locks me to no end. While potent, this one was just brutally harsh on the smoke and basically put me to sleep. Would not recommend.”"

Indica dominant yes but never did what it did for me”"
HalieWeber,https://www.leafly.com/indica/grandpa-larry-og/reviews/1396389,"“I'll preface this by saying I don't normally go for indicas but either way, I strongly disliked this strain. I didn't get much from it except the strong desire to sleep. It can completely ruin a good time if that's what your looking, if not, I'd stay away.”"

It has the aroma of sweet pine, lemon and menthol, very candy like, but dank. The taste is a pleasant and refreshing citrus flavor. The effects are  strong, but functional. A typical cerebral buzz, with nice upbeat qualities. Provides all day relief without worrying about falling asl...”"
