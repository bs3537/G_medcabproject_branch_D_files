I suffer from a mental illness known as Borderline Personality Disorder and it caused me to hospitalized over 20 times and I was on up 7 medications at once that did not help then finally by spending two years gaining knowledge from a great professional crew they saved my life. I'm 2 years now with no hospital visits, no major issues, and I have smoked ...”"
LauraJayne,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1318799,"“I have been growing "BOG" strains for many years.
All strains are great for pain in one way or another.
'Lifesaver' is by far the very BEST strain for all over body pain!
Especially Fibromyalgia, Cancer pains, Depression, Bi-polar, and exceptional at lessening or completely getting rid of migraines. 
  As a Cannabis care giver, I find this strain the best for over-all aches and pains.”"
ThatGuyOnTheCorner,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1375074,"“Very relaxing, euphoric high. I smoke to deal with chronic back pain, insomnia and depression, and this strain is one of the best I have found to combat all three. It tastes sweet, with earthy and berry undertones”"
gurth1211,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1217715,"“This strain gives a happy, beautiful high. Very appropriatly named, definetly a Lifesaver! Also, smells similar to Lifesavers... break open a bud and grape Lifesaver becomes dominant. One of my top 3 strains for sure!!”"
dl091l,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1375071,"“my absolute favorite indica, truly puts me to bed. I don't review often but every time I pick this strain up I am impressed. Feel your mental load melt away, after that you will feel your eyes get low and your pain disappear. there is nothing uplifting about this strain, although the stress and pain relief it provides will have you in a good mood.”"
HighHopesGourmet1983,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1426250,"“I got a hold a a cross between lemon haze and life saver. I suffer from chronic pain due to scoliosis. Have metal rods, screws and it hurts everyday. This strain truly helps. I was able to find a concentrated version, very effective in treating pain.”"
DabRapport,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1338466,"“Great pick me up for me without any annoying anxiety. Soothes minor-moderate nausea and pain, doesn't force you into a munchie binge.
**4.7 would dab again. 👌”"
brentsconnell,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1321522,"“I give it 4 stars I would give a foreign a half if there was a four and a half but the only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is for the extream dry throat and dry mouth”"

LauraJayne,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1139926,"“Lifesaver is by far my favorite strain to date.
As a caregiver and grower of 10+ years, I find that it can and does help w/ a myriad of health issues. Not just for me, but for so many of my clients!

The only warning is: make sure you are somewhere where you can relax and fall asleep!”"
Moviebuff,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1155137,"“Great strain for daytime doesn't make you tired but still feeling good and like you had more energy then you usually would, tastes sweet like a berry
Great overall smoke”"
sakesakesakesake,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1353384,"“This is the first weed I've smoked so far that feels like what everyone describes about an indica. I was incredibly cozy on my couch, couldn't and didn't really want to do much, but almost in a bad way. Like in a 'cocaine crash' way. A bit restless and my body felt super heavy. Just smoked some silver haze to get out of the super tiring high. Definitely an amazing night time strain for people who have trouble getting...”"
CannabisLinz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1375073,"“I absolutely love this strain. I am dabbing on some Lifesaver live resin right now to relieve some of the worst cramps I have ever felt. I almost went to the hospital but after a few dabs, I am able to stay home and deal with it. I highly recommend it.”"

melopez32,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1237314,"“A highly underrated strain in my opinion. You can't beat it's berry sweetness that accompanies the nice mixture of head and cerebral highs. This strain took me on a fun little roller coaster!”"
olsonrj,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1217719,"“I bought this strain for the first time recently.  I vaped it and man, this is a tasty one.  Sweet,  pungent.  Effects were really nice - uplifting,  euphoric,  no negatives for me.  This will definitely become part of my regular rotation!”"

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1182922,"“Smells like lifesavers! Grape, bubblegum, candy smelling. Hints of kush. 

Feels like a benzodiazapene. Great for relaxing. Very pleasant euphoric high. Great CBD to THC ratio.”"
maizande,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1146256,"“I highly recommend this strain if your looking to wind down and chill. I experienced an immense but gentle body high. A beautiful balance of CBd and thc. I experienced very clear and focused thoughts. Lifesaver is calm, comfy, clear, light, sweet, aware, and content. So far this is one of my all time favorite strains.”"
DizzyDominos,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1372838,"“Great strain, a real lifesaver.  Excellent at knocking out pain, keeping me focused and alert.  I could see myself using this at the gym, where it's so important that I get activity but so hard when everything hurts.  The flavor is sweet and, yes, reminiscent of a pack of lifesavers.  Highly recommend.”"

billy.denis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1061813,"“Grew outdoors yrs ago, kinda put em in and forgot about em.  They turned out awesome, but because of my neglect....I only got a oz per plant.  BUT....for no work but putting some good dirt in, and never watering, that's cool with me.   Believe I got the beans from " spice of life" seeds. Like I said...years ago!!”"
bagosunshine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1061811,"“I found this strain better (more powerful) than Purple Mr. Nice AND Durban Poison.  I am a frequent smoker and can smoke 2 gm a day easy, so I guess my tolerance has increased over the years.  But I very much enjoyed Lifesaver.”"
poopydoo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1225216,"“I just got this strain today. I immediately tasted the berry and sweetness to it. Much harsher on the lungs than I expected. The smoke coming from the lit end is blue but it changes to a pale yellow when you exhale. I felt overall happy and very satisfied. The nugs have a nice density to it and the kief on it is notable. I really feel a good body high which makes it great for pain.”"
Cmm2857,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1796382,"“Pretty mellow. Good taste and very euphoric. I like it.”"
HiDlong,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1237939,"“Great strain. Very well balanced, a nice mix of uplifting euphoria, with the tail end being relaxing, and not too heavy.”"
DanDanger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lifesaver/reviews/1209403,"“Smoked it. Loved it. Tasted of candy and sweetness. Kept going back for more until it was gone. Bummer.”"
