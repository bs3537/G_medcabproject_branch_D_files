tjm1986,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glue-tech/reviews/1322426,"“Really good for people suffering from anxiety. This strain relaxes your body and mind and helps you escape from stress with one or two hits. Probably my new favorite anxiety strain.”"

Wish I knew it's lineage, anyone else? Someone at my dispensary said it's Gorilla Glue and Cookies. What "cookies," I have no idea. I'm not buying that! 

Definitely worth a try. A hybrid, indica dominant strain?”"

Jagacin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glue-tech/reviews/1505248,"“Very potent strain. I was ecstatic to get this from my dispensary and I must say, I was not let down. The high comes on strong and quickly. I noticed a euphoric and heavy feeling behind my eyes that gradually spread throughout my entire body. The body high was so strong, and overwhelming blissful that it was almost psychedelic like. Hopefully, you haven't planned on doing anything on this strain other than melting in...”"

It has that typical gorilla glue smell and feel, absolutely amazing and literally melts any and every pain away. Not for inexperienced users, a little goes a very long way.”"

I work construction and have arthritis and multiple back injuries within minutes I got a warm relaxing feeling in my hands much like from a topical cream and can feel my back loosening up. 

Heh the screen started twisting a bit very heavy high couch lock for sure and i haven't even cleare...”"

MuchoGusto,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glue-tech/reviews/1367156,"“Smoked an eighth of this Glue Tech purchased in newly-minted MA! The high begins in the head but never really steps on the gas. As soon as I've brought out the art supplies and set up my tunes I find the creativity subsiding and the indica taking over. It's a hybrid, but much more in the variety of evening smokes in my opinion.  Will it get you high? Yes. Is it something to write home about? Not really.”"
