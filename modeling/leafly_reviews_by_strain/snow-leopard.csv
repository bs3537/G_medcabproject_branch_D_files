On both accounts it was exceptional and I commend the tender who made the recfomendation. I love this more than.any other strain im goimg back to spend my tax return and stock up.”"
prettybluefairy75,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-leopard/reviews/1506605,"“Gorgeous frosty buds, super loud aroma, has a strong earthy/woody taste but not like you're smoking dirt. Flavorful but not overpowering. Sneaks up on you, gradually instilling a perfect mix of brain & body high. This is my first experience with this strain and I'm totally digging it so far.”"

HonestJaime,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-leopard/reviews/1357298,"“Snow Leopard hits hard, but hits slow. Imagine the beautiful endangered animal slowly stalking toward you and curling around you wrapping you in a soft cloud of white fur. That's what smoking Snow Leopard feels like. In my case that has an almost immediate sedative effect so I wouldn't recommend smoking this if you have places to be, but if you need a good sleep, smoke this with your nighttime tea, it will accompany ...”"
DayTripper7711,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-leopard/reviews/1287719,"“I dabbed some wax and the feeling is GREAT; heavy Indica effects creep slowly toward a very high plateau that has me wanting to lie down for a cat nap.”"
Horgh,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-leopard/reviews/1290846,"“The Snow Leopard I got tested at 32% and hits like a bulldozer. I didn't say freight train because it moves slower, but is just as strong. This is one of my favorite hybrids, I stay energetic but also get euphoric. It's also super sticky, yet breaks apart nicely and smells great. Love it.”"
kenkennyorkenneth,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-leopard/reviews/1381449,"“I found this strain over at Sweet Leaf Illusions, testing at a impressive 30.5% this strain is unlike any strain I've smoked before it. It has a really heavy hit. You feel it behind the eyes right away with a heavy creeping euphoria. This strain will sit you back in your chair.”"
NWMH,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-leopard/reviews/1425133,"“I got this for 16$ for 1/8 and I'd buy it again and again. it's not my favorite strain, but it's tasty, and very mellow. I'd buy again in a heart beat.”"

Frostiest loveliest bud I've seen & clocked in at about 28% THC.  Great flavor, but even better high.  No couch lock, but stellar relaxation & a little trippy without any anxiety.  Super strain that may become my favorite, even though I usually lean toward sativas.  Fire Flower knocked it outta the park with this...”"

Just did a few dabs, with my homie Shottie, of some beautiful Shatter type BHO, processed by Botanical Laboratories over in Portland. We then proceeded to sit, awestruck at the way the light and smoke mingled, couch locked for an ungodly amount of time. With a particular musky, warm terpene profile Snow Leopard has a creamy mouthfeel, reminiscent of the most exceptional of Mcflurries. W...”"

monstapuss,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-leopard/reviews/1342277,"“Very happy to have picked up some of this live resin.  Zero sativa effects for me. Very sedating in a perfect way (if you like heavy indicas). 

Good for insomnia. Goodnight!”"

ChicagoBudTender,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-leopard/reviews/1611663,"“Ten years smoking all over the US and these are some of the prettiest buds I have ever seen. This phenotype came out with deep dark green leaves, and a rich orange smattering glued together with a quite literal forest of trichomes. 

Admittedly, while it was a fantastic smoke, it was also a harsh one. Effects definitely heavy, stony, melty.”"

Lucretia0403,https://www.leafly.com/indica/snow-leopard/reviews/1426866,"“I bought this specifically as my "going to bed" bud. It definitely made me sleepy and relaxed, which actually kicked in right away. It didn't really help my pain, but to be fair, I'm in rough shape and in pain all the time. I also noticed a peppery kind of note, so you may cough or at least need a beverage. 
Overall, I enjoy this bud and I'll include Snow Leopard into my nighttime rotation.”"
