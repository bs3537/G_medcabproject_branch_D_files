BabaBhangi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/pakistan-valley-kush/reviews/1395722,"“One of the best Indicas. Has all the trademark Indica characteristics and a lovely, spicy weedy flavour and aroma. Traditionally most of it is processed into charas or garda hash but a small amount of buds and leaves are also consumed as edibles referred to as bhang in the local language.

It starts with relaxation, followed by euphoria, and finally followed by sleep. This is an every night strain for me.

It's doable as a daytime strain to calm anxiety or relieve pain. I would just use a little less or space it out a bit if I didn't want to nap.
