Lil Sebastian
=============
Rider23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lil-sebastian/reviews/1732134,"“If you enjoy hybrid’s, Lil Sebastian is king. Very potent strain, but also feels great in body and mind. The best upside to this strain is, regardless of your tolerance, Lil Sebastian will bring the heat. Guaranteed a great ride.”"
KnifeWrench91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lil-sebastian/reviews/1743397,"“For and indica dominate strain, this really has more of a “heady” high. It’s vey subtle, kind of lingers in the background. There is no big blast of euphoria, rather a gradual, “oh, hello, how ya doing” approach. At roughly $17 a gram, not a bad buy. I’d recommend it for a session smoke, couple friends, a few beers, and good conversation.”"
