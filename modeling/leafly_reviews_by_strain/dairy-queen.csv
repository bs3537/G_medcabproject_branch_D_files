Sapphyy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dairy-queen/reviews/1382729,"“I picked up an eighth of this when i went in to get some eerl because it looked and smelled so incredible. An eighth consisted of 3 buds (I had to weigh it when i got home to make sure). The buds were big, dense, dark green, and frosty with a sweet yet somewhat funky smell. The smoke tasted almost like a cherry creamsicle and was pretty thick. The high was very enjoyable and made me suuuuper creative. After vaping ab...”"

Dairy Queen is the most perfect end of the week chill out and relax in the sun strain.  I know this because it's the end of the week and I just vaped my first bowl of this strain.

I feel very happy and euphoric.  My chest feels light, my energy is fantastic, I don't feel like sleeping at all, I just feel good.  I'm sitting here typing which mean...”"

I had this from a first time grower and it was magnificent all the way around.  the taste is light and pleasant, the high is long lasting and uplifting while settling nerves and sending bad thoughts away.

It is a high yielding plant but a pain to trim because the buds don't get super huge like some of my other strains. She sure is LOUD though...funky cheese smell that's hard to get off your fingers.

Another reviewer mentioned how important it was to them to have a strain that doesn't cause panic/anxiety/paranoia. I am more prone to anxiety attacks and paranoia than most patients, and certain strains will set me off, whether I'm alone or with people. I did not experience any ...”"

Takes 5-10 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. Tastes like vanilla ice cream with hints of caramel, yum! NO ANIXETY/PARANOIA (an absolute must for me). Head high heavy but not overwhelming. Body high perfect. Not sure if this' an indica dominant or if I was just really tired. Awesome stoner sex with me hubby, yay me!...”"

Being named after America's favorite 1940's frozen treat stand, this cheesey sweet strain has a unique aroma that brings to mind a creamy cherry gelato with a little extra funk.

JD3RR,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dairy-queen/reviews/1341832,"“First things first. The aroma of this strain is unlike any other: it smells like cheesecake, with an undertone of sweetness.
