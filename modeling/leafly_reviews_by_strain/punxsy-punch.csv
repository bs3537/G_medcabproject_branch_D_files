Its way more on the indica side, as a hybrid. Enjoyable, pretty easy to get your head around. Good body effects and nice to see some regional representation. Tastes like the mountains.”"

Form: Shatter

After getting this 3 times I still like to use it for pain relief, it doesn't help me with severe pain.  Three different batches all have a slight harshness to it so it must be a strain characteristic.  
It's Fruity Chronic Juice & Katsu Bubba Kush. 

I wouldn't use this as a morning or night time strain, it's perfect for a day time dab.

A bit of a body buzz, but more heady than tactile. Great for a little mid-day pick me up. Helped with aches and pain, but not severe pain. Helps immensely with concentration and focus.”"

My skepticism was confirmed as I got a hard on, while coughing,  not even 5 seconds after taking the dab. I don't have a significant other but had I did she would of been in trouble lol.”"
