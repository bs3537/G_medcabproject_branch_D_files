Space Queen
=============
earthlyfire,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1395925,"‚ÄúThis is my total fave strain ever. I have really bad anxiety and trouble concentrating on a good day and not all buds are good for that. I'm very hesitant with new strains and after trying Space queen I fell in love. Literally. I like to do things while I smoke. Be productive.. And enjoy it. I don't like the super strong couch coma buds. This one was clean and amazing and just great. Absolutely no paranoia or frantic...‚Äù"

But today I picked this up. This stuff is good, I feel perfect right now, hard to explain. Put me in a good mood and just plain happy, and my body is tingly, nothing overpowering though,  which I like. If I smoked more, though, I'd probably get sleepy, but it would feel damn good. Would be pleasant day...‚Äù"

deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1399589,"‚Äúüå∏üå† Space Queen. Her flavor is intriguing. Quite a nice mixture of, "Wtf...Hmm...", a new book, spicy potpourri, faceplanting into a floral arrangement, and a delicious sweetness from unknown fruit(s). I have never come across anything that has smelled like this. This is one of a kind. A lovely sativa-dominant hybrid with a high that is uppity and uplifting. This is a perfect strain simply for existing as a human be...‚Äù"
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1341686,"‚ÄúThe only thing I regret after acquiring space queen, is that I didn't buy more. She is perfectly balanced..just the right amount of head paired with the right amount of relaxing body. Erases anxiety... Perfect for any fun activity or even a day at work, if you want to feel positive and smile a lot... Gives you just the right amount of energy paired with calm..She's in my top ten.‚Äù"

Gaxie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1212737,"‚ÄúThis particular strain give you the sensation of being in the middle of nothing.  An airy feel, not to high and not too low.  Leaves the mind clear .‚Äù"
chrononaut,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1391905,"‚ÄúPrepare for lift off! This Hybrid will rocket you in to space! The strain is Indica dominate... Yet, it has all the markers of a Sativa. 

If your a connoisseur of Hybrids its a must on the list of strains. Strong start, with a great lift in mood/body.

When in full effect the high makes me kind of spacey and very relaxed and happy. Not much coughing with this, I found it a lot less irritating on my lungs then many other strains. I found the Sq to be good for body pain including from fibromyalgia.‚Äù"
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1205937,"‚ÄúI've purchased this strain many times and have always enjoyed it. This was a particularly powerful batch and it is multidimensional, as Space Queen usually is,  x 2.... Alters consciousness in a very interesting way.  Of the 52 strains I've tried in the last 18 months, Space Queen is definitely in my top 10.‚Äù"

Too much can bring on some paranoia. It's very clear-headed as well. I've enjoyed Space Queen at all times of the day. It feels very versatile. Great for doing things with others and also alone.

This strain is almost annoying because the high is so much in your head and makes you think a lot of stupid things that don't make sense.

Mikayla,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1189543,"‚ÄúTried a pre-roll, anymore than 2 to 3 drags is too much, it can cause a definite strong head high, even stupefying if ya abuse it.  But for a definite pain equalizer, arousing, stimulating and uplifting high keep the drags to a few!  Thoroughly enjoyed this strain, a lot stronger than my Brc but just as effective in the pain department.

Will use it again!‚Äù"

I find that I prefer smoking it from my pipe instead of the pre-rolls that this bud is sold in.  Makes me incredibly thoughtful, happy, and cloudy. Does make my eyes pretty dry in comparison to other strains and I really end up craving sweets while smoking this.‚Äù"

MisterPatchoulli,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1294525,"‚ÄúSpace Queen combines Romulan, from the White Rhino family, with Cindy 99 from the Jack Herer family.

Very fragrant. It smells like I was abducted by bikini clad space babes and now they have me restrained in their UFO. Everyone is perspiring a little from all the activity. But the air is not too thick.

The smoke leaves a pleasant candy like coating on the roof of my mouth. Delightful.‚Äù"

Not as heavy as a high as I was expecting but does give my a lot more to think about.
