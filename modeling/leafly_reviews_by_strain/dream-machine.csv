Dream Machine
=============
Professorspliff,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dream-machine/reviews/1601412,"“I love this indica, it is very potent and robust in flavor(Taste) like a fine wine out the vineyard Dream machine has the sweet and sour highlights of all the classic dreams.  Mellow way out with the Dream machine!  This one sneaks up on you with each pull!  A constant state of relaxation and chill vibes.  Great for the 420 crowd or lazy afternoons.”"
