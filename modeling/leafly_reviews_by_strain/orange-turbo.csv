OGlovw,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-turbo/reviews/1344414,"“First time I smoked it I got super baked I felt happy inspired and very uplifted”"
TGuardian,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-turbo/reviews/1344459,"“Had a very pungent orange smell which I loved I felt relaxed and creative through my day music is a bliss to my ears with this strain and my stress was gone like non-existent.”"

I'm doing a live review while enjoying this with a nice gold tip tabcacci spliff. (I use fancy cardboard gold party straws as a joint crutch)... Gold tipped joints make me feel fancy, like I should have a top hat and monocles.

Immediately I notice the distinct taste of orange candy, almost as if it were a jolly ...”"

Introduced to me as "Orange Tango", I searched high and dry for this strain. 
For those of us who can't go a day, or even several hours without smoking, this one satisfies on the first toke.”"

It's not very potent so I used to when I went to work because it wasn't that noticeable. If you're new to smoking then it's an excellent step forward, but if you have a higher tolerance, then you won't be to ecstatic with the results, all in all, it's a pretty average hybrid, I would smoke it again, just wouldn't pay for it! 😏”"
incenseandbamboo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-turbo/reviews/1333471,"“Though it wasn't the best-tasting weed I've ever smoked, it was definitely worth it in the end. I was very creative and calm. A very good strain for studying for a test. Near the end of the high (which lasts for an hour or so), I became very tired. Recommend smoking at night to clear your head of the day's troubles. A bowl is all you need.”"

Slothcupine,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-turbo/reviews/1309743,"“Really heady high that hits immediately but never too hard or for too long. Aromatically citrus-y, and does taste nice and sweet compared to most other strains. But it burns far too quickly and for less potency, less plateau time. As such, while I won't have it often, I do think it is great for daytime use requiring energy and focus; I just personally didn't enjoy how quickly I smoked through this. Not cost-efficient...”"
