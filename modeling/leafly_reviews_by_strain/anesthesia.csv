PauliK,https://www.leafly.com/indica/anesthesia/reviews/1343607,"“(afghani x skunk / herijuana) Very potent.  1 hit and wait is advised.  Immediate effect is up but will creep into very stoned\high.  Not for beginners (can be too instense)”"
DamienDarke,https://www.leafly.com/indica/anesthesia/reviews/1415018,"“A friend of mine invited me over to his house to smoke some of this stuff. I never heard of it then, so I wanted to try it.  A newbie friend of mine came with me to try this.  When we got there, my friend had a 4-hose hookah in the middle of the room with a packed bowl the size of a doorknob.  There were only four people there, so we each got a hose to ourselves and he put a coal on the top.  About an hour later, we ...”"

Very high calyx to leaf ratio which is always great to see. The smell isnt as strong as i think it can be, so a bit more curing would have been appreciated. 
 I am a heavy 10+ year daily smoker, my tolerance is disgusting. But this stuff is Thick. One medium sized bowl (3 hits) get me pretty tired fast, in the middle of the day...”"

hkh5,https://www.leafly.com/indica/anesthesia/reviews/1372170,"“one of the best sleep strains I've tried. munchies are manageable, and it puts me OUT. considering I have PTSD and normally wake up every 45-90 min even on other heavy indica strains, getting a solid 4+ hours in a row with this is phenomenal. last night after smoking this, my partner told me that my cat was laying on my stomach meowing super loudly for over 10 minutes and I was so fast asleep that I didn't even notic...”"
ElectricFeel,https://www.leafly.com/indica/anesthesia/reviews/1353241,"“Omg, literally for some reason my friend and i could'nt shut the fuck up. This strain made me lazy, but unfortunatly i had bad dry mouth (gum to the rescue) and also i ended up getting dry eyes, only a little tho.”"
DBCooper,https://www.leafly.com/indica/anesthesia/reviews/1242355,"“I've grown a different particular phenotype of Anesthesia for a few grows and been very happy with it - It's Pyramid Seeds version which is 90% Northern Lights and 10% Black Domina. Much like NL characteristics... it's a pretty heavy hitting body high - Definitely a good couchlock or sleepy time medication. It usually weighs in with a THC percentage of 18-21. If you can find it I highly recommend it!”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/anesthesia/reviews/1557440,"“Picked this up @ Bloom in phx awhile back. I was expecting way more of a knock out with having herojuana as a parent.
It's only mildly sedating at best. This just felt like a regular old indica.”"
snufagluf,https://www.leafly.com/indica/anesthesia/reviews/1144257,"“Very strong, smelly strain. As soon as you open the container the smell fills up the room.  Even for experienced smokers I would recommend pacing yourself and waiting between hits, a super high will sneak up on you. Otherwise, great potent strain that leaves you numb and relaxed. Great strain for a movie before bed.”"

SpyroJunkie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/anesthesia/reviews/1424439,"“My buddy, my guy, my pal. THIS. This is incredible. I have severe, chronic pain and this beautiful flower, bless it's soul, eliminated most of, if not ALL of the pain sometimes! I only smoke this during daylight, though. Elevated my paranoia/ fear of the dark, but that's my own experience. Cheers!”"

Great for right before bed and would also help those with sleeping problems.”"
bc7110,https://www.leafly.com/indica/anesthesia/reviews/1372880,"“Very relaxing medium chairlock situation with this one,  excellent chronic pain relief which helps greatly.  Started to feel sleepy and I was out, when I woke I had the munchies.  Your thinking is blurry yet you can see clear at times kinda psychodelic situation I think.”"
Steekvlieg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/anesthesia/reviews/1411542,"“THE BEST FOR PAIN. I suffer with pain on a daily basis and this strain is now my new best friend. It is amazing.Be careful it is very strong so use carefully. It brings on heavy couch lock but in the best way ever . You will be so chilled you wont give a fuck.”"
