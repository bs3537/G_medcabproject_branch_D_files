jrtrio,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/midnight/reviews/1417083,"“As a Vet forgotten by the VA because I was having a good day when they "evaluated" me and determine I was 0% disabled! Now it's been long enough that the VA can shrug it's collective shoulders and tells me they don't care how many back surgeries (5) so now fighting my pain had become a crusade with me. Finding the right strain to make our lives better. Like Midnight and Blue Dream. One gives me pain relief while the ...”"

CronMonk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/midnight/reviews/1373080,"“This was recommended to me for dealing with some arthritis pain, and it did exactly that, and more. Although pricey ($12.50/g bud or $7.50/g for crumble), I personally think it is worth the extra money. My pain was almost knocked completely out, and I was felt feeling relaxed and happy. The effects last for about 2-3 hours for me. Highly recommend this for people looking to take the edge off of their aches and pains....”"
Ganjanier,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/midnight/reviews/1366193,"“I am a high thc low cbd person but this stuff rocks. Didnt burn me out at all but made me pretty energetic.  Love those strains. The aroma wasn't like I was used too. It smelled very fruity and floral. Not that dank or skunky at all. Would make a killer indoor grow. Kicked the crap out of my anxiety which has been causing huge social issue the last few years and actually made me pretty social again. Had a great glowi...”"

Perfectly manicured and dried, exquisite sweet and musky aroma and taste - I was in for a treat when I decided to fork over for this top shelf stuff. Mostly a straight purple with neon yellow hairs and a few sporadic spots of green, very visually appealing.   High in CBD, not too much THC, preparing me for a restful night.  Highly recommend with a sandwich, comfy bed, and TV remote or lapt...”"
Green_Soldier,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/midnight/reviews/1383083,"“I was not fond of the smell originally, but the high was worth the taste. The clearest high I've ever had, there was no echo-y deep high moments, my thoughts were coherent at all times. 
The only complaint is the medical benefits only lasts a short time. And was re-medicating every 40-60 minutes.
I will experiment more with this strain in concentrate forms, and edibles.
Great strain for someone who likes to get the b...”"

However, this strain works very well for daily mid level pain relief (I have sickle cell anemia and osteoarthritis )   It puts mid in a good functional mood, so I can carry on a daily routine and be around my family, without being a couch potato.”"
Measurings,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/midnight/reviews/1357041,"“Very amazing strain in my opinion. I underestimated it. But once my brother had me try it, pretty quick results.

BurnyLumina9k,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/midnight/reviews/1357046,"“My favourite sativa dominant strain! A nice uplifting head high and boost of creativity without the sometimes annoying body high from indica that can mess up your coordination and ability to get shit done.”"
Baggins80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/midnight/reviews/1357044,"“Enjoyable smoke, I rarely smoke anything other then skins so the flavor in Raw unfiltered papers was great. Certainly an earthier strain. The high is good and again enjoyable but I felt more couch lock then wanting to get up and go which I had anticipated. For someone with a bad back and knees, the pain relief was the highlight of the bud. Super comfortable feel.”"

This lead me to try Midnight for the first time and after a couple puffs, I felt the anxiety leave and the knot in my stomach dissipate for the first time in days. I highly recommend it!”"

All though it’s a small and a short plant with moderate yield. Usually early to mid-September, high CBD strain is great pain and strong aroma of pungent and a little bit of sweetness to it. Six is more than enough for me to smoke throughout the season.”"
