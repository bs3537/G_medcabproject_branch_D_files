Mavioren,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/funfetti/reviews/1289694,"“Densely packed nuggets of purple and green leafs entrenched by orange canals of pistils with large trichomes. It looks like a zebra, if a zebra was green and purple and a flower. A very distinct strain that can be identified just by sight alone. It could be considered the black and white cookie of marijuana without the upset stomach. 

Pleasant mix of Pine and Earth mixed with dark cherry. It is not a strong smelling...”"

I usually get some level of anxiety or paranoia from smoking, but overcome it because I like the other effects.  This strain left me feeling amazing and I slept like a baby 30 minutes later...highly recommended!!!”"

The thc content was 25.65 percent. For connoissuers only, amateurs wouldn't appreciate the complexity of the bud.”"
KetsuBear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/funfetti/reviews/1365800,"“Hands down, one of the BEST buds I've ever smoked. No matter if its from a joint, a pipe, or a bong - the taste is always delicious, the high comes on quick, and the effects leave you relaxed, happy, and all around in a damn good mood. 10/10 will buy again!! Warning: I would NOT recommend this for first time smokers. Grade A weed like this might produce too intense of a high for those with low tolerance and therefore...”"

RxMedReview21,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/funfetti/reviews/1473219,"“Wow, what a strain this is. If you are not a heavy smoker, you won’t enjoy this as much since the high is so different. It feels great and makes the day brighter. Recommend if you are working and wanted to smoke something that won’t stop you from everyday things”"

Kennsington420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/funfetti/reviews/1195954,"“This is an exceptional strain.  I sometimes get paranoid/anxious with cannabis use, but just get over it because I like the other effects...this strain made me totally relaxed and I was out like a light within 30 minutes.  I usually go to a pure OG late at night, but this is now my go-to relaxation/happy strain.”"
Millionaireeee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/funfetti/reviews/1241366,"“This is a pretty moderate/maybe even light strain. It's very clear headed, it also is one of those rare strains that makes just about any activity seem appealing. I also found that reading just about anything is amazing on this strain..I don't read otherwise haha. Anyways, love having this one on hand..I've even went to class on this..retained some stuff  and any topic was super interesting.”"
NoRobo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/funfetti/reviews/1192135,"“Sure as heck tastes like birthday cake. Has that creamy flavor to it. The flower has nice density to it with deep shades of purple. The effect is a nice clean head high and it keeps you there for quite awhile. Try this one out when it is in town. Grown by Bay Exclusives. THC 21.05 CBD .05”"

A good soft body effect, and wonderful flavors on the pallet.  Some say it is good for sleeping, I found it energizing and so will use during the day.  Not a nighttime one for me.”"
