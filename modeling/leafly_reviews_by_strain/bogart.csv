Glad they dropped the price to where to should be for it's quality”"
capnsmokee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/bogart/reviews/1165926,"“Really like this strain for an uplifting, fun, creative effect. I find that, depending on how much I consume, I may or may not get the munchies. Most times I'm pretty social and productive on this strain. Also find that the effects don't last as long, maybe an hour and a half, then start to feel a little lethargic with this strain. One of my go to strains either during the day or early evening.”"
