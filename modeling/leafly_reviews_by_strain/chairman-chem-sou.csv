Fun, because you are clear headed, but very high at the same time....I like this sort of conscious shift.  I had a lot of mundane tasks and wanted to feel euphoric while doing them.   I would say this strain is powerfully euphoric and uplifting and isn't that why many favor sativas? I would buy this again.”"
