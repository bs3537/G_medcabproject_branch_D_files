MiguelAEstrada,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1385958,"“Smoke:
We smoked it from a joint which was small and tightly wrapped. We didn't even need that much. Probably about .2 between 3 people was definitely enough. Shortly after we lit up we were squinting our eyes and laughing at jokes. I would recommend this for a day time smoke and definitely for an active schedule. Its definitely not tiring and am able to go about my daily business. 

Taste:
The taste is very swee...”"

Just a hit or two of this and I get totally engaged in my work. I'm prone to paranoia when I smoke sativas; that doesn't happen with this weed, long as I don't hit it too hard.”"

ObiBudKenobi,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1381775,"“Picked this little gem up from Advanced Farm & Garden in Ypsilanti. Strawberry Blue was a great Sativa dominant strain for me that provided a good head high, and moderate body buzz (no couch lock here). Burned smooth with an opening sweet flavor, and had a sweet berry flavor in the vape as well. A daytime, anytime, for sure. Providing euphoric and uplifting effects, and moderate pain relief. Recommended for Daily Use...”"
punxxero,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1272682,"“It's good stuff if you really like a dizzy body drunk feeling.  High energy at times, happy feeling.  Not much of a mental high for a chronic user.  Definitely has it's uses though!  Great for getting housework done.”"
bobericc,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1223715,"“very nice strawberry. one of the darkest ghastly buds ive ever seen. tiny berry notes, heavy strawberry smell and flavor. if you love strawberries and black weed this should be high on the list.”"
SWhite06,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1294970,"“Amazing. Absolutely love this strain. It's not too harsh of a smoke that it irritates my asthma. Nice smooth hits. You really don't need much of this bud to lift your mood. Also helped me a ton with my anxiety.”"
mrwright85,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1242919,"“Loooooove this strain! Strawberry Blue was super easy to grow, with good yield; but indoor growers be warned - she can get pretty big if not properly cared for. The smoke was tasty, smooth and she really does leave a strawberry aftertaste. The effect is very relaxing. She helped me cope with depression and anxiety during a rough time in my life. I will not hesitate to grow her again, and I highly recommend this strai...”"

Remedy394,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1562925,"“Strawberry Blue smells and tastes strongly of sweet, sweet berries. It is great for socializing, getting things done, and even sitting down to work on something creative. This strain offers great pain relief and a sort of calm energy. I'm pretty sensitive to the heavier sativa leaning strains, but I experienced zero anxiety w/ Strawberry  Blue. Definitely recommend! 🔥💥💚”"
MacTiger,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1290229,"“Very nice. Not too intense, which I prefer. I felt happy and calm but still had energy. Not giggly enough to enjoy a stupid movie... Probably good for daytime activities though. Really loved the lack of anxiety and paranoia! That's always my biggest issue.”"
lawofsin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1382677,"“Tastes strongly like a strawberry with lighter smooth exhale. Amazing color in this shatter from terpalicious extracts. Reminds me a bit of jack on the exhale but definitely a good mellow Head high great for beginners in my opinion. Very Terpy and good for most occasions as its not overpowering or couch locking.”"
clr420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1230595,"“Smelled it at emerald city and it smelled like orange juice. when i got home to smoke it i was definitely surprised it tasted like strawberries and blueberries. very good for my back pain and migraines.”"
JoePMan111,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1600225,"“I prefer lemon tasting sativas but this has a good fruity tastes. Seems to mellow me out well. Helps my mood nicely and increases my appetite which is rare. I've heard it's also a great aphrodisiac but I've been sick and without a date for ten years so I'm not a great judge. My I'm not super easy to please but this strain I'll buy without regret”"

Very energetic, productive (if you feel like it) and giggly, with a mild euphoric buzz.

JiggyAlienEyes,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-blue/reviews/1214623,"“I didn't think too much of this the first few times I smoked it, but now I think it's one of my faves. It gives a nice chilled high, and I tend to have alot more focus and energy. Perfect for an afternoon smoke, or in the early evening. If I smoke it too late at night I have trouble shutting off my brain.”"

You cant stop smelling it once you get a whiff. It is possible some may not like the gassy smell  but mixed with that sweet berry it is a unique smelling dank. I imagine this strain indoor is pumping out some of the best bud available. ...”"
