Snowcap
=============
MellowSailor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowcap/reviews/1412876,"“This strain produces a nice, clean and clear-headed high suitable for daytime use.  It feels very "thinky" and gets your brain really moving.  Good for creative endeavors and conversation, but not good for nighttime use or for those who tend to get a bit paranoid or anxiety-ridden.

Not recommended for nighttime use (unless you want to stay up), as it promotes insomnia, a racing mind and a light, shallow sleep.

KindGodess420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowcap/reviews/1415807,"“Mood enhancing euphoric bliss!  Stoned yet focused, I love creating while snowcapped. Also mellow enough for meditating, cloud watching or reading. Sativa social, indica ideal. Alert elevated awareness, happy heart, peaced out pain free body. Suits this picky smoker toker lady just fine.....”"
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowcap/reviews/1398408,"“I've purchased this strain many times and I am never disappointed.  It puts you in the best mood imaginable.  You feel glad to be alive.  A couple of hits and you are smiling.  Energy, focus.....and fun!”"
CannibalCarni,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowcap/reviews/1398410,"“One of my favorite stains! Just 2 hits is all I need to get the best effects from this weed! Motivation, motivation, motivation! I use this strain when I have a lot of physical work to complete.
Additionally, this weed is my best outdoor strain. Being outside is just awesome! I really enjoy the outdoors on snowcap.
P.S. Great flavor smoke too!

I am a cancer patient who has to use the bathroom frequently. To throw up unfortunately. Anyway its the best tasting strain I have had in a very long time.

We were very happy, lively, chatty, full of fun and just having the best time of our lives.  Every single worry and stress we had was completely gone - only the good feelings remained.  The high lasted well after we went to bed - sometime past 1:30am.

unherduf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowcap/reviews/1351024,"“Excellent hybrid strain. Focus has been a noticeable plus. This hybrid is also quite potent, making the experience an invigorating, creative, focused and happy one. For pain treatment, specifically migraines, tension headaches and even cluster headaches, SnowCap is one unique hybrid, keeps you alert and relaxed plus perfectly focused on whatever task you might have in front of you.”"

So potent, smoke a little harsh on throat, but definitely worth the cough attack. BEST PART = NO AFTER EFFECT. Stayed awake all night but once I closed my eyes to sleep still allowed me too. So excellent”"

The Snowcap i got in Humboldt was lemony smelling, big round dark green w hues of purple sometimes. It's still in my top 5 danks to this day after trying many other strains.

paynetactical,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/snowcap/reviews/1165141,"“SnoCap is a great daytime strain, as most on here have already pointed out. I love smoking this strain as it gives you a nice medicated feel but doesn't impair you for mental activities. The smell is wonderful, and the amount of trichromes on the colas is just beautiful. It looks like the snow on top of a mountain peak. Also it makes everything seem more Wintery and Frozen.”"
