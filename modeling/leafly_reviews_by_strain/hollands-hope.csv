Holland's Hope
=============
TriconeDrone,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1385180,"“When the stars shine a little too bright
And you can't sleep at night
Cause your body and mind are in a fight.
There's hope from Holland to put under your light,
It'll make you sleep so tight.”"
gm0d123,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1377152,"“This was the first cannabis I had ever consumed in my life.  I accidentally took a large hit from an improvised aluminum can pipe of 0.5 grams in one hit.  This led to a fit of coughing not from the weed, but from my virgin lungs.  Anyways, after about 10 minutes, I literally nearly collapsed, ran to my bedroom, and sat down.  I found myself in a total state of euphoria, with the feeling of losing sensation in my arm...”"
xybermatthew,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1366497,"“Hits you fast and lasts long. Had a bit of trouble remembering simple things like Internet passwords,  phone numbers, and conversations but it definitely put me in to a real good happy mode and had no stress.”"
bathshebashebarat,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1366496,"“Super dense nugs, medium green/yellow in color. Smells like deep lemon-fruity dankness, super sweet. Tastes just as good as it smells, super smooth smoke too. So good.”"
crazycolton55,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1366500,"“This weed had a strange fruity flavor to it, followed by a dank aftertaste in your throat. It makes you cough big time, but when the high kicks in it's all worth it with a relaxed mellow state of focus and euphoria. 4.5/5!!!!!!”"
RachaelWoods,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1366499,"“I love it because it is an uplifting indica that doesn't give me anxiety and it actually works. Great for depression!”"
dreadpiratebuttercup,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1366501,"“Left me feeling very down and depressed afterward. Even when the high wore off. Was an alright tasting weed. High seemed to last forever.... I felt strong feelings of paranoia.”"
GrapplingTime,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1322979,"“Feeling like you can't focus? Do you have brain fog? This is definitely the type of strain you want to help focus and read a book with. I find relatively light water bong consumption, (.5 grams) will elicit a very concentrated state of mood. Consuming more will make me too stimulated - to the point of not wanting to focus on any one particular thing anymore!”"

DontDrinkBromine,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1307990,"“For some reason, I really feel like this strain would be a great party weed because my friend and I both agree that it gets you really stoned and lost in space-time. I would recommend before playing some games to make things more interesting.”"
MOJOmike,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1366508,"“My personal favorite strain of weed. An unbelievable high that I've not heard a complain about”"
BaconSoda,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1250011,"“Real earthy outdoor grown strain, packs a punch on the exhale. Has me good after 3 hits for around 4 hours.”"

itsdeliciouschi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1363872,"“Maybe it's because I was smoking it at the same time as a strain with a very heavy head-high, but I felt like Holland's Hope was a bit too mellow and light of a high for me. I would only use this when I just wanted to chill at home by myself.

One thing I will give this is that it was good for pain relief without getting much of a high feeling. If I wanted to suggest a strain to my mom, I might say this one.”"

MsApxahren,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1366507,"“I loved it. 2 hits in and I can feel the relaxing effects starting to roll in... I feel happy, I'm loving everything... and when I smoke later I don't have to smoke much to get back to the buzz I had going on earlier! I love it. I feel like it's a strain well worth it's price and it smokes so slowly that you're actually being frugal with it and its not even a concious choice. :) I'm happy I decided to give it a try!”"

Tokerman92,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1618066,"“Wow. This is an incredible indica. The flavor is amazing, it smells like walking in a field of flowers. Both vaped and smoked, the great flowery taste and citrus accents still came through very clearly. The high? It's a really good couchlock, you'll be veeeery disconnected from reality, so get ready. However, as someone suffering from depression (and social anxiety) I find myself to be very calm and focused when acti...”"
GrapesonGrapesonGrapes,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1316902,"“Dense dark green and purple buds. The buds were  extremely compact and packed with crystals. The smell was earthy and a bit grapey. The earthiness definitely carried through in the flavor, I also get some pungent fueliness. I really dig the flavor of this strain. The effects were very relaxing and stony. I found it relatively heady for an indica. Great for pain relief, insomnia, and stress relief. Store in a head st...”"

Archangel,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1360691,"“Very good and long lasting high.  Makes you feel a mix of positive emotions; happy, giggly, uplifted.  Unfortunately comes with a huge appetite and dry mouth.  I tiny bit paranoid 2/10.  Thought someone was standing outside my sliding door!  LOL - good times!  I have pulled/sore muscles and bad arthritis in both hands.  I was somewhat pain free 5/10.  It was like someone turned a dimmer switch on my pain level even t...”"

Exmo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hollands-hope/reviews/1265079,"“In the right quantities, this strain is perfectly enjoyable. However, one time my wife loaded the vaporizer and put way too much in and it was one of the most jarring nights of my life. It would have probably been comical from someone else's point of view - I was terrified by what was happening on Downton Abbey and I pretty much had to huddle up and keep repeating "Weed can't kill you. Weed can't kill you. Weed can't...”"

Gets you high and somewhat paranoid, but we're not sure if it is the weed or just placebo from reading the effects.”"

He grew them the second year because he thought the first year was caused by the very wet 2012 summer but 2013 was scorching and although they grew even bigger, they did not bud properly. He was forced to make bubble hash which was lovely but the quantity did not even save enough money to cover costs.
