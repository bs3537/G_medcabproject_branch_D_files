smokemuchey,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1410183,"“Bred by the Oregon Cannabis Authority. Great piney taste. Flowers are rock hard, crystalline, and topped with thick red hair. Gives an intense, rushing sativa high. For haze lovers and fans of Lodi Dodi.”"
mastaT,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1348688,"“Top strain bud for sure. Beautiful dense buds with that classic
 trainwreck aroma of sweet and spicy. Not a huge fan of Sativa's but this one is worth top shelf price. Breaks up easy and the smoke is smooth. No way you can wrong with trainwreck with super silver haze. The high for sure has the trainwreck high!”"

Jules24,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1358373,"“This strain is a heavy hitter in the best way, I floated to the top of the highest cloud with the energy and mindset of awesomeness. Safe to say this strain is amazing😍🌲”"

ymama,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1391744,"“To quote a friend of mine who also tried it; "you don't need Cialis when you have Silver Train in the house".  Ha ha, this strain is GREAT!”"
JazztobaccOG,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1466591,"“Lovely strain! Amazing euphoric sativa high! Great daytime smoke! Great for heavy smokers with high tolerance like myself, very high THC and terpene content, very dense buds. An 1/8 of this stuff will last me two days instead of only one! Shout outs to the OCA!”"

craakyerhead,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1339325,"“It gets 4 stars just because the bud I sampled was a bit harsh, and made me cough. 
However. It's got a smooth flavor, a nice slow onset of the buzz, I almost instantly felt my stress melt away with the first puff, and the rumors about the aroused feeling are definitely true.”"
inthewild,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1393135,"“Good day time strain. No side effects as far as I could tell. Probably not so great of a strain for bed, contrary to the budtender recommendation.”"
MusicallyFF,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1276253,"“My personal favorite. Fun for when you're with someone else *wink wink* For a sativa its got a pretty relaxing high if you don't do too much of it.”"
BlackWidowWitch,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1288754,"“Super clean taste. Intense euphoria and floral taste.”"
LaGoong,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1277257,"“Small compact buds that break up perfectly for the bong. Smell has that familiar, fuelish bite, co-mingled with a citrusy thing. I wasn't particularly taken by the taste, either on the inhale or the exhale. The high though, is quick and strong. Surely you can feel the sativa rush, but I'm also feeling pretty spacey and easily distracted. Not in a bad way, I can still focus on this review, haha, just that I don't thin...”"

terdfergeson23,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1544824,"“Probably the best sativa I've ever smoked. Amazing smell, slight bite on the taste but an immediate head change. It's like a good Scotch whiskey and would be a sin to waste.”"
Xtoff,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1431781,"“This is an aphrodisiac strain for sure. I haven't had anything else like it so far and am going to keep this in stock at all times.”"
bl19712,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-train/reviews/1336401,"“Definitely top shelf! One of the strongest I've had. Smooth burn that smells amazing and sweet taste.  Great aroma, great bag appeal and the high is magnificent.  It will not disappoint.”"
