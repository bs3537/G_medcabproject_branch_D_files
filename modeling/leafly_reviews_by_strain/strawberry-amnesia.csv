Look: My buddy only had a 8th of this for me, alot of small nugs, classic sativa nugs, not really dense but clusters of white and amber trichs cover it. Green and yellow are the dominant colors with red hairs.
Smell/Taste: The stuff i got wreeked of sour pungent strawberrys and hazey catpiss. The taste was a sweet pungent chemical strawberry taste, so unique and delicious.
Effects: A rush of sativ...”"

She taste like a piece of heaven when used for cooking, Very sweet sugary smell.. This Sativa dominant hybrid is suitable for a nighttime smoke.”"
lemondude13,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-amnesia/reviews/1359363,"“Strawberry Amnesia is easily one of the more flavorful and vibrant smelling varieties around. She is fairly stoney for a sativa, taking after the strawberry cough in many ways, but still lending a good dose of euphoria and elevated energy. The initial kick is very like a hazey tropical sativa, almost leaving one blissfuly clueless to what is happening around them. These effects quickly evolve into a classic stoney gi...”"

rUcereal,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-amnesia/reviews/1391629,"“Definite sativa. Kind head high, which makes everyday tasks easier. It'll help you do all of that laundry. Not much of a body high. It's missing that component that helps ease the physical symptoms of anxiety.”"

Jumps right on ya when it hits, feels like its massaging my brain into forgetfulness. Not too race-y like hazes are at times for a sativa, so no anxiety with this one. If you're a noobie take it easy at first, high tolerance people will be very satisfied from small amount. Definitely made my tummy unclench and toes/face tingle.

Sleepy when you finally come down and ...”"

It got that indica part that gets you calm, just the necessary pace to think we'll and coordinate just fine. With one hit you'll be talking like a mad scientist, parroting about this and that. Maintains you energised and the euphoria appears as the time passes to leave you motivated and with no physical buzz at all”"

I rolled a number hoping for better things, unfortunately things didn't get better there seemed to be little in the way of effects from this one, there was little or no tasted to it & a hit that just left me feeling down.

I wouldn't recommend this one & would a...”"

Strawberry Amnesia packs a powerful punch that only a high quality sativa hybrid can produce. The flavor of the smoke is to die for too! It has the reminiscent flavor of Strawberry Cough mixed with a tangy sweet hint of citrus that makes you all tingly and happy the second you inhale. Did I mention ...”"

forestmssenger7,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-amnesia/reviews/1370810,"“The first onset of high I felt a little more indica, after about 10-15 minutes this radically changed to a more uplifting, focused, energetic type of high. I felt like the HMH strain may have had a even higher CBD, or CBG content. The focused feeling and clear headed high lasted for hours and with no redness of eyes, and just a small amount of dry mouth. Overall this strain is a great daytime strain and quite fruity....”"

The colour is so vibrant, bright green lots of orange hairs and loads of crystals. Smells so fresh almost a little plant like but retains the strong sweetness and the powerful dank smells that most hazes don't release until the nugs are cracked open. Always very dry and crisp, have seen a few where the grow hadn't been perfected and often results in a v...”"

Provides a euphoric head high which is accompanied with happiness and an increase in appetite. Would definitely recommend it for depression. Perfect to keep you going during a party, but also good to enjoy alone before bed.”"

"Loving the smell of it. Lives up to the amnesia family name. Had a goodnight's sleep and will be getting more."

I'm now getting some of this next weekend, before my trip to Holland.

It's a 3 star review, as I haven't had it yet. But again, leaving this review for a friend.”"
