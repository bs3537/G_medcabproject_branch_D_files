Super potent. Could only take 2 dabs. 
OK it's been an hour and this is all I've written. 
This is like, the way I want my weed to feel.  I'm giggly and in a strange (but good) mood. 
Today was super stressful yet after dabbing the stress of today seemed to fade away.
In my top 10”"

YungSoose,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonberry/reviews/1327635,"“Smells amazing, like a lemonberry slush from sonic and the taste matches. Dense small nugs with lots of long red hairs. Smokes good and the high is euphoric and uplifting forsure good to smoke during the day. Enjoyed some tasty keef aswell.”"
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonberry/reviews/1174054,"“Smells of lemon and earth very interesting the bud structure is about the size of a quarter nice orange hairs all over this bud. Darker patches of green while light green shades underneath almost like it's hiding its lighter colored leaves. 
Nice fresh bud on the grinder left behind some keif to use later as a treat. Lemon Thai is hard to come by but when asking for the genetics of lemon berry. Lemon Thai was involve...”"

bluevpfree,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonberry/reviews/1327631,"“Best smelling strain ever with strong lemon and blueberry smells. Unfortunately its the strangest tasting weed ever (vaped). Terpene profile is wacky. Menthol + industrial solvent + earthy + a hint of blueberry. Yuck, I won't vape this again. High was nice and stoney, nothing out of the ordinary or remarkable about it. Cool novelty weed for the smell.”"

Looks  very frosty and smells just like your doing house cleaning /  the Lemon /citrus smell takes over, and it was a Odd thing for me to get use to - needless to say, AMAZING high, that hits you're head with energy and creative ideas that last about an hour or so, depending.  A must-try!”"

I was very exhausted and yawning a few minutes ago, but after idek how many hits, I feel ready to do whatever I need to do. I feel great. I keep taking more hits just to taste how nice it is again”"

SafetyLast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonberry/reviews/1704391,"“Pretty solid strain overall. The effects sort of differ from time tot time for me though. It's chill weed, but It's not the best ever. 
It smells a bit like oranges, and when grinded up the smell really came out.  The taste of this strain is superb as well. The blueberry muffin is clearly present and pleasant. There's a lot background taste of lemon. The hit is not too hard, but cottonmouth creeps in.
So do the effec...”"
LorDoza,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonberry/reviews/1239034,"“4.5, great hybrid. Fat, long nugs that are dense and drenched in kief. Ground up shows off the inner beauty. Exhales of Lemonberry include sweet, earthy undertones that blanket the high that follows. It'll knock you down and have you pretty damn stoned. Enjoy this great hybrid”"

Its up there with Rock Star and OG Afghani.  the sweet after-tones make ya wanna go back for more. Be warned more is not always needed.........”"

Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonberry/reviews/1387947,"“Lemonberry gives off a strong citrus smell the buds are short the structure is very compact and about the size of a quarter if not bigger. Lemonberry is different from a lot of strains that I've tried. One of the differences that I noticed with lemon berry is that the strong body heigh comes out first.  Rights as the body starts to hit me the head high hits me is a little bit of a headache pressure which is something...”"

potprincess2000,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonberry/reviews/1303123,"“Like Jillybean and Girl Scout Cookies, Lemonberry is a very tasty after dinner strain. It tastes like lemony blueberry muffins. This gave me a pleasant body and head buzz. However in higher dosages it caused a lot of dizziness and tiredness. It's definitely best to have this at the end of your day.

JrollandJroh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonberry/reviews/1297332,"“This strain is an absolute gob-smacker. First inhale was like breathing candy floss, no individual tastes just sweetness and earthy. Bit of a slow hitter but this will send you into laughing hysterics and will be sure to get you to sleep. The nug structure is clean and very green and the texture is dense but soft outside. 10/10 strain, recommended for those in a bit of stress or feeling down in the dumps, itll be sur...”"

legalizeTX,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lemonberry/reviews/1187645,"“Just got my hands on some lemonberry! Very nice smoke. Good for this rainy day. Very cerebral high, mind feels like it's floating. Head pressure which I saw mentioned in the other reviews is spot on. Head pressure not to the extent of a headache but you'll feel it. Definitely a good representation of a hybrid strain.”"
