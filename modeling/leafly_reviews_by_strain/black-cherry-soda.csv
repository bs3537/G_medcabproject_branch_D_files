Black Cherry

McKjudoChop,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/black-cherry-soda/reviews/1417750,"“A favorite in flavor and a mediocre but still fun high. She's a creeper and arguably a stage 3 clinger. Swooped in gracefully, stayed for a few and exited gently. The flavor and aroma are intoxicating. Her buds are beautifully marked in deep purple. I love this stuff but it just doesn't hang around long enough to really get to know it. Perfect for a day hike or a stroll on the beach.”"

This is the first strain I've EVER tried that gets me that wonderful tingle of pain relief without making me even more tired.

It was recommended to me to help me sleep and to calm my brain at night (to help me sleep). But I've actually found I prefer it as a daytime strain.  Although it isn't the most active of feelings, I am able to get tasks accomplished while using it, like chores, banking online, and my crafts.

Oh my goodness the taste of this strain. I’m not usually super snobby about smell or taste in weed because it all kind of tastes the same, but this one has me coming back for the same reason I did for LA Soda.

I can see this one becoming a favorite.”"

Was a little concerned being a hybrid that it might trigger more anxiety than most indicas, but this certainly feels like a more indica leaning hybrid. At average doses its not all that powerful -- quite relaxing -- but I did get a bit of couch lock at higher doses.”"
