The only drawback is the high isn't very long lasting, you can make it longer by taking a small amount of hash oil in edible form and then smoke a pinch or two of this. In larger doses it makes me lose all motivation and it's hard to move.”"
currykush,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/purple-haze/reviews/1153479,"“This is a potent, cerebral sativa with delayed onset. Once the high set in, it was highly psychedelic- colors, sounds; it heightened the senses. The ensuing, intense euphoria enhanced creativity and made me happy. I wouldn't recommend this for a nighttime smoke as it keeps one up and active, I also got relatively paranoid from this strain.”"
