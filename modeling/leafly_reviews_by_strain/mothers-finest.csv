coolandfun,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mothers-finest/reviews/1219754,"“Just tried this for the first time and it's "ok". Nice fruity aroma. Very light head buzz and gives you a clear mind (more or less...I mean, you're still stoned after all ;) So if that's what you're after then go for it. I prefer more of a body buzz, and while I know that is indica territory, I was told this might have a good head/body mix. It's 100% head, at least it was for me.”"

Worked well relieving the battle field in my mind too. Being a quadraplegic not by choice :) with cancer too and gone thru the chemo&radi treatments this workd great for the nausea. Hard to come by not living in colorado :( :( :(  so close yet so far :)”"

I'm a mom so this strand gave me the energy I needed and I really felt like being creative and moving. when it wears off I get pretty sleepy but it's a great strand.”"

avobian,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mothers-finest/reviews/1338068,"“Definitely a string buzz for me. Got couchlocked. Road the euphoric painless cloud into a giddy arousal with my wife. Pleasant, will revisit.”"

griffinfsho,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mothers-finest/reviews/1298315,"“Not bad. Definitely more of a head high. Not for lovers of kush or other indicas. Nice, bright, fruity flavor with almost a lemony/pepper exhale.”"
kotin9,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mothers-finest/reviews/1298884,"“MOTHER'S MILK......absolute favorite strain, so relaxed, no paranoia at all just good times and high fives”"
avobian,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mothers-finest/reviews/1338070,"“My first strain. First time trying weed. Maybe went a little overboard because I ended up couch-locked. Definitely a pleasant high that left me lifted and floating with an edgy aroused feeling that dissimilated nicely into a lovely evening with my wife. No pain either. Definitely will revisit”"
brie1284,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mothers-finest/reviews/1297556,"“great flower with wonderful crystals. smooth hit, but can become harsh quickly. I suggest smoking this one slowly. great strong body and head effects”"
Bart8888,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mothers-finest/reviews/1745110,"“Mother's Finest is the Haze/Sativa-leaning version of Jack Herer essentially, Just like Jack Flash is the Super Skunk/indica-learning variety. Won a HTCC sometime in the early 2000s. Top-notch sativa, very pinot and with a fast onset. A couple of tokens and it's there. Difficult to compare to any other strain. It's excellent value though. If you can find it, give it a go. If you like sativas you won't regret it!”"
CaucasianOutlaw4,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mothers-finest/reviews/1176058,"“Tried it out and it was some good shit. It had a fruity taste at the end and it burns great. It's a good daytime  weed or if you're low on energy because it gives you a nice uplifting boost.”"
ouiher,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mothers-finest/reviews/1325690,"“I'm obsessed with this strain. It gives me tons of energy, makes me happy and keeps me focused. I love it...yay! 💋”"
bc7110,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mothers-finest/reviews/1543978,"“From the first hit I received full body relaxation.  Strong chronic pain relief which is nice and my mood was happier and uplifted.  Gave me the sweet tooth and made me pretty sleepy.”"
