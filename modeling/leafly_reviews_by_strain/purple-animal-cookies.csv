One of the best strains I’ve smoked, It tastes amazing, like grape and is smooth every hit. The head high is not over powering, but the body high is extreme. Not couch-lock extreme, but definitely super tingly. 

I smoke everyday.”"

Doesn’t put you right to sleep and gives a good relaxed focus. The smell is incredible. Very sweet and slightly earthy with a hint of blueberry. The bugs are decent sized with hints of purple. Enjoyable nuggage overall.”"
