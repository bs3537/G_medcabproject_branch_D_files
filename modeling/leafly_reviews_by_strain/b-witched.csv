jaredhuffman907,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/b-witched/reviews/1586534,"“I’ve been smoking every day for 5-6 months, so my tolerance is rising, but this strain consistently f*cks me up. It comes on slow and mellow but it leaves you baked. I’d say the high makes me couch-locked but not sleepy. Would be good to smoke if you don’t have any physical activities to do. The buds are dense and covered with trichomes and big hairs. Definitely a good one”"
