I went to my local dispensary and talked it over with my bud tender and they suggested I try Shark Attack. I wanted to wait a few times to get a good feel for it before writing a review and I can say it has been consistent across the board. This gives a really fantastic body high and a nice " in the clouds" f...”"

I used a flavored paper so didn't get to actually taste it but it does go good with white grape papers made me feel like I had a strong advil all my pain just drifted away...”"

Good CBD percentage and 20.37% THC. The high was definitely somewhat body oriented, but it had a great head feel too. I very much enjoyed this strain and when I need some indica in my life, this is definitely my new choice.”"

However I will give this strain a second shot after tonight! Chill af! I rolled an after yoga j of this with some cannotonic (a must have) and I'm relaxing pain free. Perhaps this is a strain that needs to be mixed instead of smoked alone.”"
ChemDawhMillionaire,https://www.leafly.com/indica/shark-attack/reviews/1389670,"“I love this strain. It's a super nice body and head buzz with the perfect amount of cerebral euphoria.  It's a kick back and watch a movie type strain. With a high focus from the sativa. One of my favorite strains for sure.”"

Felt focused straight away and locked off to some alien programmes big time. Was mostly an indica high but then the sativa laughter did kick in a couple times but ultimately was just very relaxed, focused and had major body tingle which was nice. Got a great nights sleep with shark attack as well. Good all round indica would defo smoke again.”"
Marex420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/shark-attack/reviews/1670405,"“Nice strain with good aroma. 
It will make you be really relaxed but at the same time not sleepy. I smoked it with my friends yesterday and it get high you like an extacy-you relaxed, but you want to dance, you feel music and really want to hug your friends. 
Also make you creative. 
Recommended :)”"

As soon as I sat down the munchies kicked in and then a nice leg fuzz and a nice headbang begins. This strain made me very talkative and very aroused also gave me a good nights sleep”"
Indicaem,https://www.leafly.com/indica/shark-attack/reviews/1260771,"“As an indica lover, I normally go for the highest level of thc possible, but this strain also has a relatively high content of cbd which really relaxed my body and took away some of my aches and pains.    I didnt get the same type of high off of this as I do something like kosher kush, but this was a nice mellow, relaxed high that helped me to concentrate and get some work done on the computer.”"
