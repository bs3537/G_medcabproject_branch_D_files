Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/m-39/reviews/1381643,"“The worst weed you can find in Montreal - it's notoriously poorly grown, has very little smell or taste, minimal trichomes and just lacks everything from strength to bag appeal. It's a very common strain here but it's really just for kids who don't have a clue and to rip off tourists. If you have a need to try our local strains Jean Guy is a nice widow/skunk cross, but frankly go west young and old potheads, go west....”"

Steveed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/m-39/reviews/1329169,"“This is a common strain in Montreal. It comes two ways: finish poorly (common) & finish well (uncommon)

Really pungent and leaves you with a great high. But the pungent is so strong that you need to triple wrap it in foil/ziploc bags to hold the smell in.”"

It has a very strong smell almost a combination of paint and smelly body odor. and is usually a very dark green and covered in orange hairs. The smoke is harsh and has a gas taste to it. The high is short (no more than 1.5 hours) a very light to mild Indica buzz. You need heaps to become satisfied. But this is a commercial strain and grown for yield and quick f...”"

If you listen to an 80s song, you will feel like it IS the 80s right now. Flashbacks of childhood and early teen years appear. If you listen to a song, you will remember what you experienced when you were young and listening to the same song.”"
