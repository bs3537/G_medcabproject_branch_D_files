I have had great success with this strain and would recommend it to anyone. It doesn't seem to give me the munchies very much unless I want it to by waiting about 30 min if you haven't eaten recently,but it is manageable. This is one that is great for night time. I am not very functional on this strain, so I usually take a dose before bed. Great strain!”"
