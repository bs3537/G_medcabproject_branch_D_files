rshackleferd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/think-different/reviews/1412534,"“This is undoubtedly the best single plant i have ever grown. I couldn't have designed a better plant for indoor growing.

When I have a lot of luck, euphoria and empathy for me. From this grass I have never been devastated. Dry eyes, dry mouth, this is the only downside but it belongs to it. : D I used 2 LEDs 65W with cold white light. Duration of about 3 months and one week.
