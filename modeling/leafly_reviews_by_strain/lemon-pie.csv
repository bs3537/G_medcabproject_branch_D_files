I went with friends to look at houses for sale. Thank God we had a really mellow and laid back realtor. I just couldn't seem to stop talking and laughing for just about any reason. This strain would be perfect for parties or just getting out to do things. There is a slight body relaxing element, but the sativa shines throu...”"
marywannuh,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-pie/reviews/1380181,"“Lemon Pie is a great sativa... total head high... I looked on Leafly to see what the rating of the strain was and saw a 3.8!  How could this be?  Lemon Pie deserves a much higher rating!  I deal with bad anxiety and Lemon Pie made me relax and I felt completely uplifted.  It's a total upper, definitely a day time strain.  Great smell, great flavor. All around great sativa.”"

StLBudman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-pie/reviews/1477772,"“Only gave three stars because it was super dry and burned way too fast.  I think I paid mainly for the name attached to the strain rather than the quality of the flower itself. I'd only buy this again in a pinch.”"

 It'd be wonderful if this one stayed around here for a while because I'd definitely buy it again when I run out which looks like that'll be real soon because this is really good.”"

The nuggs were right and dense and had a wonderful taste. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted to go out opposed to sitting relaxing”"
spacexravioli,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-pie/reviews/1572807,"“Holy fuck the high I received from this strain has yet to be beaten by any other strain; solely based on the crazy euphoria I received from it. I have no idea why the euphoria rating is so low but that needs to change.”"

NMHiker,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-pie/reviews/1389267,"“This for me is a light strain. It is mostly a light cerebral high.This is not crazy buzzy but it does make you happy, warning it does give the crazy munchies. It has a wonderful lemon smell. The buds are gorgeous with nice orange hair through out the green bud.”"

Jedisattva,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-pie/reviews/1263152,"“Nice fresh flavor. I got a gentle, fresh lemon taste but not much else. Moderate strength. I found the high to be so clear and somewhat generic that I didn't feel high enough and smoked through this faster than other strains.”"
pagan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-pie/reviews/1343372,"“I am very disappointed. Got it as a shatter and  I almost couldn't feel any effect. Gave it 2 stars for nice retail packaging with "Leafs by Snoop". It is hard to believe that this could be ever approved by a Master himself.”"

Perhaps I just got a bad bunch, not sure though because this was my first time trying it.  Everything about it was weak: the smell, the flavour, even the high was barely noticeable, which for me is unacceptable.  I wish I hadn't been lured in by the low price deal.  Definitely will not be buyi...”"
