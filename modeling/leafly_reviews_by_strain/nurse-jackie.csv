Loved how the strain smoked enough to go back & get more, and when I did, I realized why I liked it so much, one of its parents: Medicine Woman! Great for cramps and other pains, every chance I find it, I get it!”"
Gutta,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nurse-jackie/reviews/1365579,"“This is a great sativa strain. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had some good organic N Jackie. But I'd bet the hydro version is KILLA!!!”"

TheGhostHead,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nurse-jackie/reviews/1375640,"“Quickly becoming a top five for me. I love the Medicine Woman. Don't believe I've  tried Jack the Ripper, but this cross (when grown properly and will lots of LOVE) has a beautifully complex flavor profile, with either a stronger lemonene zing or this heavy citrus taste through and through. The stone goes straight to the eye's, but clear; very clear. Clean. Focused. Obviously it's not with out it's 80% plus Sativa ge...”"

RealOregonWoman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nurse-jackie/reviews/1650955,"“Excellent medicine!!  I curse the company who no longer markets the cartridge in Oregon!  Apparently they weren't making enough money on the strain so to hell with the patients who depended on it.”"
awhovian,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nurse-jackie/reviews/1260598,"“This strain is tasty, smooth, and doesn't make me too "busy". I can focus and be productive while (usually eliminating) dealing with migraine pain. If I know a migraine is coming, I will head it off with a little Nurse Jackie. Nine times out of ten I will not need a rescue pharmaceutical (i.e. Zomig, Imitrex).”"

buddymac28,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nurse-jackie/reviews/1340319,"“Smells like lemon scented pine sol and tastes very lemony and piney with a hint of rubber and something else I can't quite put my finger on yet. The high is very sativa, hitting right in the third eye and top of the head. Very mentally uplifting, pulls my head up into the clouds.  Very smooth vape, with no coughing. I find this to be a very pleasant almost pure sativa. No headache, dizziness or paranoia. Quite relaxi...”"

nerveana,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/nurse-jackie/reviews/1258770,"“The only thing I didn't like about this strain was that it was harsh on my throat and lungs, using a volcano vaporizer. Pleasant taste and decent effects, but didn't last super long.”"

Made for a smoother smoke but still not what I was hoping. It was a clearheaded high with a short duration. This was on my to grow list but now I am not sure. THC 23.8 CBD .05 CBN .1”"
