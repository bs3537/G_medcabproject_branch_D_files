smdraper,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1375699,"“Unknown by origin Blues is unofficially only found in the UK however it is one of the rarest to find this indica heavy hybrid as it is mainly sold up North but make no mistake this green is sure to send you into a relaxed state of euphoria!”"
Skorchemed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1394690,"“Grew out this strain. It is a stout strong plant that only just doubles in height after stretch. With thick chunky nugs that are as tough as golfballs, thanks to its particular style of rubbery resin. The smell and taste are the same, comprising of deep mature cheese with hints of berry topped off with asian spices. A well rounded head to toe stone with little ceiling high that will drift you off to a perfect sleep.”"
Sweetlemonhaze1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1534383,"“Hey guys am from the north of the uk ( Scunthorpe ) and this is a very popular strain , it’s an alright high dependent on the grower , and personally not that “pukka””"
SKUNNER,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1378833,"“This weed IS amazing DEPENDING on the grower , I see people saying it tastes horrible and gives you a headache , yes because you had shitty blues .

like I said it all depends on the grower , Personally I hate Blues but sometimes I get some of a certain person and its always good stuff”"
SensiSi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1321400,"“Those blues clones still comin from the north of the uk init......Very nice smell and taste, these particular buds tho are a average 6.5/7 outta 10 due to eger muppet growers! Still its a Q thatll get me thru...”"
EnglishToker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1375901,"“I have tried this particular strain many times and don't really remember any bad side effects (with the exception of that couch-locking/laziness feeling that always occurs when smoking it).

However, I recently purchased some and all I got was a full-blown panic attack. I felt happy before smoking it and there was no reason for me to have any anxiety.

I do suffer from anxiety disorder but I can't even remember the l...”"

Bluedemo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1626879,"“If I can help it, the only strain I smoke. Northern UK. Great tasting, berry skunky aroma with a sweet after taste. It's pretty rough and ready, doesn't look up to much but it has a long lasting pleasant effect that rounds off nicely. This strain is rare if you don't have a link but also it's one of those strains where there's no fooling the buyer, you can tell straight away it's blues, there's nothing quite the same...”"
dzkaye,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1227125,"“beautiful stuff if your lucky enough to get hold. nasty stink almost chemical. amonia x berries love it. dont plan on getting off the couch though ;)”"
Wingzey,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1395357,"“This is one of my favourite strains as if you wanted to relax and get some sleep or just chill out with mates, it's perfect. 
I don't think it has any bad sides to it (other than feeling lazy the day after) but the following day(s) feel very motivated and determined 
I rate blues highly!”"

EnochChell,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1379427,"“Like other reviewers have said, Ive had lots of different kinds of blues - the quality, taste, and type of high vary from grower to grower. generally a sweet berry smell with blue cheese flavours. high is typically a strong body high with a little head high. generally speaking I love this shit.”"
50spinuplover,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1398863,"“Made us nice and relaxed, made my head a lot clearer,  didn't get munchies of it my mouth got really dry after its like that when you wake up next day too”"

nakedgun420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1236831,"“This is not blue cheese, such a head high and is a very sativa like strain  but this such a pungent smell!”"
Claudegreengrass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1287386,"“People to this day up north still don't realise that (pukka) blues and blue cheese are totally diffrent strains. this one is more heady and totally smells of berries not the strongest around but does the job.”"
dreamininertia,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1262623,"“I can't get enough of the taste of this bud. It's a very common strain in some parts of the world and when you get a choice of very standard strains (blue cheese, amnesia, lemon haze etc) this is my go to choice. It's an extremely  acquired taste and smell, it's pungent of chemicals and tastes just the same. A lot of people won't like this strain because it's a such a strange taste and smell but I love it. It's  very...”"
Jackazoug,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1493176,"“Nothing special compared to other strains, but it makes me cheerful and dreamy. Only smoked a few times but I prefer other strains.”"
GOATMF,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1367175,"“I love a good blueberry heavy pheno of blues. big tight nugs and a lovely Berry blow on the exhale. not a fan of some of the leafy ched heavy phenos you see about”"
sianhan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blues/reviews/1179416,"“This strain is definitely not blue cheese. Grown both out many times and livers has a sweeter taste and less couch lock than BC. Livers is the clone only and Ugorg seed co have cubed it which they called blues basically one and the same. When taken at nine weeks gives me a really giddy high with plenty of euphoria. Taken after nine weeks becomes more couchy and earthy in taste.”"
