Black Diesel
=============
DuctTapeTheory,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/black-diesel/reviews/1324376,"“This is a Black Domina and Sour Diesel cross. The smell is sweet and fruity. The smoke is rich and flavorful, sweet with a strong spicy finish. 
The buzz is dynamic. It begins with a nice head effect, focused and creative. After 20 to 30 minutes the body buzz emerges. It is a nicely balanced hybrid high. Not heavy, no burn-out. An all-day medication. 
It is quite similar in flavor and buzz to Purple Diesel.”"

Amvios,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/black-diesel/reviews/1242695,"“I smoked this two years back. loved the peppery taste and smell,  very well balanced. the sample quality was a B grade, visible crystals and great look to the buds. great high definate ranges of 17-20% but it could be better. now after two years i am growwing this strain. noticed she dislikes heat over 29/31 as other strains in the same tent don't stress. her heat stress during early flowering had started black diese...”"

I felt pretty "stupefied" during my high with this one, making it difficult to go about my daily activities. Still might be fun for a nightly smoke session if all you need to do is watch t.v.”"

It was very fresh and had a large dense bud.  Smelled like fresh cut grass and black pepper.  The smoke has a black pepper taste also.

I think this would be a good strain for headaches during the day.  Its very refreshing and did not leave me tired at all.  Black Diesel made my head pretty numb which is what I look for treating my migraines. 

I will probably get some more if i...”"

MR.MORRISON,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/black-diesel/reviews/1179715,"“Beautiful looking buds. Almost black and forest green. Buzz is a nice sativa. Solid smoke. Keeps you up.”"
xCBAGSx,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/black-diesel/reviews/1137509,"“Recently finished an ounce of this weed.  I found it to be a little lower grade in my opinion...While I did get stoned on this many times, it took far too much bud to achieve that effect.  The taste was almost just a resin kind of taste, spicy and almost oily at times.  The nugs in the entire ounce were quite tiny too.”"

Schoon_the_typhoon,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/black-diesel/reviews/1714000,"“This is a great sativa strain it had a strong diesel taste behind it. I’m not much of an active person so I try to become active. When my cousin brought her pit bull over Bella I had already smoked a few bowls then got an urge to go take Bella to a local dog park. I was out at the park with Bella over 5 hours now tell me this strain doesn’t get you motivated or loss track of time. I’d rate it a great 8.5/10”"
bogeygolfer77,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/black-diesel/reviews/1317867,"“This stuff issome of the worst tasting and smelling bud i have ever had but produced a great sativa high. I had a hard time getting past the smell but the taste produces much like the others in the diesel family. Rough on the throught with a smooth nutty taste. The high lasted a while and didn't pick me up too much. put me at a really good level. Not my favorite sativa but wiuld try it agian.”"
NateDiesel,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/black-diesel/reviews/1344000,"“I love this strain. for a while now I have been strictly an Indica guy, but wanted to give the Diesel name a try, and wow am I impressed. you definatly feel the floaty uplift in the begining, then it slowly fades into a very calm, and "heavy" feeling just like most Indica's. the high then slowly fades away as you find you start to feel the thick blanket around your body start to go away.”"

sludgefeast,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/black-diesel/reviews/1453554,"“I have a monstrous tolerance, but this stuff has got me high af. it has all the effects of a strong sativa, but with the dreamy, spaced out effects of an indica or indica dom hybrid. I don't think it has the "medicated" effect of an indica tho.”"

thehydra,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/black-diesel/reviews/1270378,"“If you smoke enough of this, it will feel like GSC's darker sibling. Trippy but angsty energy. If you smoke a bit, it energizes & ever so slightly calms. Will keep you up at night, thinking about your personal brand, business ideas, chore to-do lists for tomorrow. Dare I say a bit anxious? Love it nonetheless!”"
