She is a Sativa dominant strain from parents Amnesia and Biker's Kush.

Super happy, energetic, carefree high.
Excellent way to start the day.  Pair with strong espresso and head out the door 😎”"

It gives me an intense and tingly body high, I think it’s great for smoking with someone special, if you know what I mean. It takes a couple of minutes to kick in, and the high lasts for more than an hour. I love it”"
