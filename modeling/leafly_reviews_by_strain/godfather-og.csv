Joshy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godfather-og/reviews/1417701,"“Surprised this strain doesn't have more reviews aha. Three good hits of this OG strand will have you feeling happy as hell and hungry as fuck. Beginner smokers beware. I normally don't give out 9's, but this is one of the best strands I ever smoked :)”"
DieselDude420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godfather-og/reviews/1417702,"“This is now a favorite of mine for Indica.  Nothing at all in the head ... total body relaxation.  Very peaceful.  

I had some ringing in my ears - hmmmmm.  Might have been the Poppers.  LOL

Not like want to go to sleep, but you want to be in bed with a laptop surfing the web, playing a little quiet music like Dave Rawlings Machine.  Absolutely a peaceful beautiful high.”"
Tyger,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godfather-og/reviews/1417704,"“Picked up 1/4 of this at Miramar Meds. This is one of the heaviest strains I've ever had. Didn't need to have much, and I medicate 4-5x a day. Within 10 minutes the effects were very strong. It was very difficult to think. Or move out of a comfy position. Excellent for sleeping, relaxing, munchies, just keep in mind this is a powerful couchlock strain.”"

I was out of my anxiety medication and I needed something to take the edge off after work and finals, so I picked up this strain in the form of oil. I took one hit, and the rest is history. All I need is one dab of this a day and I am good to go. Probably my new favorite strain. My anxiety ceases to develop a...”"
serinity0087,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godfather-og/reviews/1366708,"“By far the hardest hitting Indica I've smoked. Leaves a burning sensation in the chest but besides that this is a 5 * strain. Exotic terpy flavor. And the Shatter was like gold with a slight amber color when balled up. Definitely a night time str as in unless you are a Indica smoker mainly, like myself”"
orchardsden,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godfather-og/reviews/1265213,"“BEWARE: THC JUGGERNAUT!

This strain will definitely hit you like a brick, from the pungent earthy but ammonia-like aroma to the pine and spicy wood taste to the heavy sedative attributes of any great indica. 

The nugs ate extremely dense and clustered, with green, orange, light bro wn and white crystals protruding from all ways.”"
CaliChris,https://www.leafly.com/indica/godfather-og/reviews/1360824,"“Just smoked Godfather OG for the first time on my new vaporizer. Only smoked about a pea sized bud and I'm really medicated right now. Reminds me of the high Grandaddy Purps gives but this is stronger and a little more euphoric. The gram I bought is 23% thc, which is strong to me. The bud smelled really nice. And was very dank smelling. It smelled sweet and a tad spicy. Smelled pretty grapey to me. I feel pretty seda...”"

Smokes great, tastes amazing, and the experience is calming in nature. It has a great potential as a painkiller and a anti-anxiety catalyst. Overall smooth smoke and feeling great herb to stay productive on all around 5/5 from me. Mellow Indica with nice euphoric properties.”"
