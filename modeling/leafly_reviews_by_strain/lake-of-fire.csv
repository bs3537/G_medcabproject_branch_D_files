Lake of Fire
=============
Dastomba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1417472,"“This is definitely a child of "Gorilla Glue #4."  Very strong medicine, but different from GG.  Does not take a lot to get the job done.  Taste is piney/diesellie, and pretty smooth both in and out.  Effects hit me behind the eyes and then down the whole body relieving pain, stress, and calms everything down enough so it can be dealt with.  Too much, and you will be tied to the couch and asleep.  Duration is a couple...”"
Merlot1998,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1356634,"“Newbie, but tried 7 different strains this past week. Lake of Fire literally felt like I had just taken 2 vicodins and 2 somas on an empty stomach. This strain came on hard and seemed to keep going for a solid 3 hours before heading back down...for another 3 hours. Very strong. No pain, no distractions, no nothing. Just felt very relaxed all day.”"
Kimb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1356644,"“Good strain when you need a hard hitter.Pleasant smoke, not too harsh like I was expecting it to be. Plan on getting laid back w/ a smile, pain sloowwwly drifting away and then zzzzzzzzzzzz, woke up from a 3 hr nap nice and refreshed.”"

Dastomba,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1417473,"“I reviewed this strain a while back and I was impressed then and if anything I'm even more impressed. I forget that it is more indica than sativa and is a bit heavy if to much is used. Right now it's very heady and right behind my eyes. This is very strong medication that properly dosed will work all day. Great med for back or sciatic pain.”"
brightgreenie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1398634,"“So happy I found this one. Very enjoyable high. Productive and motivated. Also very relaxed and comfortable. My mind is relaxed and my body too. Long lasting. Definitely a favorite. 🔥”"
loudpck,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1356637,"“This strain is great but keep water nearby, because you will feel like you are drowning in a 'lake of fire' at some point.”"
hannahjoanpierce,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1492294,"“Upset stomach? Can't eat? Anxiety? This strain is perfect. It doesn't make your head too cloudy so you can still think without the heavy lids... it really just calms your body down and any physical stomach pain you may be experiencing. This would probably be a good strain for those of us with intense PMS symptoms during that time of the month. I personally don't taste the chocolate flavor I've heard people comment on...”"
KaptainKronicc,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1363191,"“Great strain for my nausea I get in the mornings. One bong rip and all my pain magically diminishes leaving me ready to start my day off right!”"
highdefnition,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1391999,"“Tried this as Shatter. Super earthy and pungent with myrcene and limonene jumping out at you. Very mixed effects, narcotic but nice middle ground, not to invasive or heady, also not to couch lock. This stuff was gooey as all hell though and made a mess trying to handle it even with the dab tools. Well played Gorilla Glue, haha....”"
couchlock79,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1356635,"“took great care of pain, can taste the lineage of both parents. great strain for relief and being able to go about your day,getting things done!”"
pastmaster,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1356639,"“This strain is perfect for my pain, but does not put me in the couch. It is great for the after work when my pain flares up most frequently.”"
AmID3ad,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1267709,"“works pretty well from my usage. has a good smell to it and a nice high sets in nicely”"
bubbajar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1356642,"“made me really motivated with great high but tasted really weird to me  but worth it.”"
moybueno,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1375811,"“Awesome flower. Very relaxing and not in a heavy kind of way. My high right now is nice.

beautybychandra,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1738589,"“This is definitely an indica dominant strain - fantastic for pain! Great flavor, hits fast and hard. Instant mood improvement and I could feel it start working from my neck down (much like a pain pill) relieving my tension headache, back pain and sciatica. Perfect strain, exactly what you want to feel better emotionally and physically. If you want to use it for sleep it’s awesome for that as well, an extra bowl and y...”"

youngguns7362,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1356641,"“had this strain in a crumble, which I then made into my own vape pen and it's a good! I've been mixing it with Lost Coast OG and LA Cheese, both make excellent additions that will keep you lifted. I'll be getting this one again, hopefully in shatter.”"
Bestmedintheworld162,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1417475,"“Adding to my list of perfect daytime strains.  Good taste, can't really put my finger on the taste, but this helps me concentrate and get things done, not sit on the couch or fall asleep.  The pain relief I get from it is pretty good. Like this strain a lot.”"

localweirdo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1703334,"“Definitely my favorite daytime strain for stress/anxiety and minor pains. I usually feel a little foggy for the first 30 minutes, but after that I am calm, clear headed, pain free, and ready to tackle the rest of my day.”"
fattyftw,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1463586,"“Not a fan of the diesel flavor that much. Gives a thinky high which is nice.”"
Ooze707,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1420276,"“Lake of Fire is a serious improvement over Gorilla Glue #4.  The high is more cerebral and I can function while smoking throughout the day.  Grown hydroponically, the flavor beats the pants of GG with the addition of sweet pine. Yield is substantial and easily manicured. This strain is definitely a keeper.”"
savviaddi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1732893,"“Beautiful flower, very leafy nugs with a hint of purple throughout. Very relaxing, one of my new favorite hybrids. Rolled it into a backwood and smoked it during the day, was relaxed and able to finish chores around the house with reduced back pain and felt very creative, inspired me to paint. Highly suggest.”"
derek1986,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1370368,"“Lake of fire rocks. It is a stong strain”"

dorisboris,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1540706,"“Enjoyable strain for sure! Uplifting, not very heavy, though it is soothing and balancing.”"
Ayoumike,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1496073,"“I bought a clone from a vendor having this LOF from Red Eyed Genetics out of Denver. Unbelievable. Full of crystals and grows just like the Gorilla Glue #4 with tons of branches and heavy yields.”"
mattdaganjamasta,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1442059,"“Very nice.  Good pain relief, good body high.  I noticed a little anxiety for the first 10 minutes or so (probably the sativa effects) but it quickly went away into a calm, euphoric high. Picked up an eighth after not smoking for a few months, so this should be awesome lol”"
Jennifer.mohr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1619691,"“This particular smokeable is gonna do ya right if you're looking for a mellow head high. A little euphoric, very relaxed, and with just a touch of sleepiness. You'll feel like the Dude after a night on the lanes. It's not the best out there for adding some chill to your Netflix, but it'll get you back down from a long day. Pairs well with pork teriyaki and gyozas, or rainy days.”"

MyStoneyBaby420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1398528,"“That explains why I don't care for this strain. Crossed with Gorilla Glue. For an indica hybrid it's not heavy hitting at all. Nothing great. Not impressed. It claimed to be tested at a high potency too. Oh well.”"
Chelseasellsseashellsbytheseashore,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1363138,"“Beautiful big buds! Great balanced effects and good potency. I'd love to have this strain again and would recommend it!”"

tylerpbrgang,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lake-of-fire/reviews/1417474,"“stong gas aroma. hints on pine and citrus, but very clean fuel aroma. if your into that sort of thing, no sweetness really just lemony sweet not sugary. gas , that explains it perfectly”"
