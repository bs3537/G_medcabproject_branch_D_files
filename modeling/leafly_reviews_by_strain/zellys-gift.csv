It lifts me up and lets me giggle (which has been hard lately). Not to mention it smells like sweet lemon candy. 
Highly recommend to anyone with depression”"

     This is a superior flower in every way.  The buds are dense and look like they've been dipped in sugar.  You don't need a magnifying glass but treat yourself.  It smells intoxicating.  Like grape, lemon, coffee.  The taste is...”"
xRust,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zellys-gift/reviews/1552243,"“This is my favourite strain.  Of all time. The combination of uplifting zesty flavours and mindstates makes Zelly's a perfect strain at the medicinal and recreational nexus.  Fantastic for unwinding, creating art, or working on/thinking about pet projects.

Generally tough to find in the dispensaries.”"

Perfect day time strain to get things...”"
TinCatCanuck,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zellys-gift/reviews/1512280,"“One of my favourite strains. It gave me a cool tingling in my head that wanted to pull me forward. It was energizing and great for doing housework. Best of all...no munchies. I didn't even want to eat. I'm guessing this has THCV in it.”"
blackrice77,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zellys-gift/reviews/1720199,"“An amazing strain.

This is one of those strains that do a great job managing my depression and mental health in the daytime. I find usually anything with Jack Herer genetics works well.”"

Bighec72,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zellys-gift/reviews/1683812,"“Happy high, good smoking bud, up lifting and chatty high. Bought a gram at Bloom for 8 and change can't beat it!”"
highandmighty710,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zellys-gift/reviews/1563396,"“First thing I noticed was the powerful flavor. Mad notes of lime and berry. And the smell comes off sweet and matches the taste. Super uplifted high. Really enjoy this to start my mornings off. And the indica genes really lend a nice mellow body vibe while not hindering cerebral functions.”"
Eternal.H,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zellys-gift/reviews/1780399,"“31% thc. this strain always gives me a huge euphoric head high, with laughter, relaxation (without heavy sedation). the 2nd time I tried it it gave me the most intense body high I've ever had, but normally doesn't do much to me in terms of body high compared to other strains.”"
tincturemaker,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zellys-gift/reviews/1620260,"“Like what others are saying, this sativa dominant strain gives a cerebral uplift,mixed with a hazy high, a bit odd feeling  combination of clear mind/hazy upliftment. Taste like you'd expect, light lemon jack floor clearer-ish. Good for afternoon  relaxing. I made as a Tincture ,I think this strain could be a little anxiety  producing in high dose,so try moderation first.The feeling is mostly in the head, a clear but...”"
KushK1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/zellys-gift/reviews/1616874,"“I like the high a lot! Very nice, light-headed feeling the entirety of the high. The taste is not my favorite, and the smoke is a little harsh depending on what you're smoking out of, but overall this is a nice strain to sit and giggle with friends!”"
