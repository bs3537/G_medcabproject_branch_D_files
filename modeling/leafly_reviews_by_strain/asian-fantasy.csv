I was able to stay attentive and didn't fall asleep for once. The downside for me was the red eyes. So red I could hardly see any white and they felt like they were literally going to pop out of my head, still enjoyed it though. Overall 6/10.”"

Very good for stress, pain, relaxing, sleeping, eating, and soothing for those who may ADD/ADHD.  Earthy notes with trix our kids fruity flavors.  Great price 8gr.  for 50.

A bit hard to sit still, there’s an antsiness. Almost impossible to think through cloudy, absent headspace, but thoughts do come - it’s just not easy to make them. This one is for relaxing, not work or trying to accomplish anything. Music can be enjoyably entrancing, but the high feels like...”"

This strain also pairs well mentally for those who maybe anxious, nervous, or stressed.  The nose nuances had a fruity scent with a hint of viniger.  In my opinion the price was amazing where I am from here in the Coachella Valley.  8grams for 50.  DVT.”"
