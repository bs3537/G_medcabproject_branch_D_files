=============
Beelazer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega/reviews/1333636,"“Extremely pungent and spicy flavor and aroma.  A great  sativa dominant all day herb.  A very up high that lasts and allows one to get work done.  Tastes as amazing as it looks.”"
RadGrrl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega/reviews/1327162,"“just picked up a preroll of this strain.  
Omega is proof that the numbers don't matter.  This was labeled as only 15% but packs just as powerful a punch as many 25+ strains.  
in fact,  I'm so fried after sharing just HALF a preroll with my son (don't trip,  he's 30 lol) that I can barely think of what I want to write here 😃”"
OCHObabies,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega/reviews/1327995,"“This weed has to be one of the best strains I've smoked in a while.  I feel most stoned. Extra happy and giggly. I think it has a bit of a spice flavor. My body also feels very relaxed. I'd buy more for sure.”"
canoe2112,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega/reviews/1275994,"“one of my very favorite smokes.i always find myself going back to this one.has a flavor and high like no other.a must try .”"
22ace22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega/reviews/1269958,"“Omega is my go-to sativa strain.  Sativas tend to make me jumpy and/or cranky but Omega has just the right balance.  The sativa side brings you up up up with a very clear high, totally able to function. Just enough indica to keep you balanced and takes the edge off. Love it.”"
HeavyBongRips,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega/reviews/1367961,"“Timelessly potent beginning with an exhilarating headrush that uplifts your spirit. After an hour or so the mindf**k starts to dim down, but the body high remains at full capacity making this the perfect hybrid to stay active before falling into a long deep sleep.”"

RudiCanada,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega/reviews/1247020,"“Small pale buds with colourless hairs.  Earthy wood tones on the nose, spicy on the tongue.  Almost tastes likes paprika.  Nice typical hybrid, sativa and indica effects.  Great well-balanced high.  *Great for chores”"
Sheenas420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega/reviews/1795862,"“Omega is a good sativa hybrid if you're in pain and or just need to forget about stressing things in your life. I have really bad rheumatoid arthritis and inflammation arthritis and Omega has made it to where I can clean my house without complaining or just not doing it at all. I still feel the pain but Omega makes you forget about the pain or you just don't care your in pain. This with CBD are a great combo.”"

I have tried OMEGA once about a year ago and again as I type, and I've enjoyed the hell out of it both times.  It is such a delight to the senses.

SuperFishDiego,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/omega/reviews/1327575,"“Grab your spaceship and buckle up! I smoked just over 1/2 a J with a couple friends. While they were content with chillin on the couch, I went for a walk to explore. This dank took me on a journey. When I returned to my friends, they were still locked in on the couch and non of us could portray what was going on in our own heads. The high lasted a good few hours and was enjoyable.”"
