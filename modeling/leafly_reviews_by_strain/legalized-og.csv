I opened the little bottle up and almost got high off the smell!  I was smilin' before I even took a hit.  Half-hour, forty minutes later, I was pain free and happy!  I'd been in a depressed state for a while, anxious and disconnected, and this took care of all that and the pain and inflammation.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this...”"

RedVans,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/legalized-og/reviews/1658689,"“This strain hits you straight away. It was a weird mix of a head high and a body high combined. This would be a perfect strain to smoke with your friends, chilling and having a laugh. It didn’t make me feel anxious, only a little paranoid after I hit the pipe, the power of this bud went straight to my brain, it did pass however and the good vibe tide took me out on a wave.  

Top Hybrid for me.
