Auna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-cookies/reviews/1338114,"“Great strain to smoke with company if you're looking to have a fun and productive day. This strain had me deep in thought when alone and made my body numb alleviating my back pain and sore muscles. Great for relaxing during the day or to get an assignment done. 5/5 stars any day.”"
vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-cookies/reviews/1338832,"“The buds look delicate with a coating of fine crystal, which seems to lighten its green and red textures. The vapour was sweet and smooth,  fruity with a cool hint of mint, like a fruit punch lifesaver.  I just had to exhale through my nose. It was immediately uplifting.

I didn't have to pack the pipe that full...  :) ... ...”"

Love the sweet pineapple taste that follows the mild cookie flavor.”"
RichCanna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-cookies/reviews/1334383,"“The flavors of this bud are largely Tropical followed by sweet and then a hint of pungent goodness. The effects are comprable to a classic GSC, in that they are highly "happy (10) euphoric (8) and creative (6), also somewhat energetic (6) and uplifted (4) (in that order 10 being highest and 1 being lowest). As for its Medical uses, I would have to say this strain is  best for depression, stress and pain, lack of appe...”"

I’ve got a cookie jar full of beautiful crystalline covered Hawaiian Cookies, and I’m not bored with this strain at all.

To tell the truth, I’ve pretty much under Hawaiian Cookies wondrous spell since their arrival, and I like the sneaky Sativa effects after a few minutes. This is a very smooth Sativa for this...”"

KatelinJade,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-cookies/reviews/1669716,"“Hawaiian Cookies is very sticky and has a strange pungent sweet smell. The smoke is rough and the I taste cleaner. 
The high is good. Nice and relaxing but also focused. I feel sleepy and a little paranoid. 
I wouldn't but it again. PG Kush is more up my alley.”"
