I have some serious anxiety and stress. this is one of the few strains that allows me to not have to take a full heavy dose of prescription medicine with painful side effects.  This strain is so awesome it gives a little bit of everything magical to it.  A hint of energy and a spark of euphoria.  The flavor is INTOXICATING its like a rich cheese and wine, so famousl...”"
koloradokushkidz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jah-kush/reviews/1378715,"“I was going to only give it 4 stars but then I thought about the flavor. Some of you newer smokers won't understand but the flavor of this weed has a classic taste like back when we would sneak weed from our parents room. The nostalgia alone makes me give this a 5 star rating.”"

The budtender pulled out 2 giant buds almost weighing exactly 3/4 OZ. Biggest buds I've purchased since living in CO!  The smell is lemony and piney combined, almost like pine sol floor cleaner with just a hint of floral.  Buds are dense and covered in dark orange red hairs. The high is a creeper. Sativa...”"
PowRider,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jah-kush/reviews/1074435,"“If your looking for a mellow uplifting strain with just enough kick to feel it but not too overpowering, this strain is for you.
