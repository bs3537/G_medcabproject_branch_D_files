DavenportIA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/brooklyn-mango/reviews/1202869,"“Soft texture with a lot of trichomes. Long bright orange hairs covered the bud. Id give it a 7 on the density scale. Smell was very pungent citris and it tasted the same with no extra scents mixed in. Great weed. Very potent. Looks absolutetly amazing too. Dont pass this up for showbud. Blue cheese and raspberry cough are also good for indica fans.”"

It took my pain, depression and made me happy. It also gave me energy. Another thing I noticed is that it will arouse you so its good for spending quality time with your loved one. This is a top notch quality strain.”"

Not the easiest Strain to grow but definitely worth the effort. Perfect for a Day Smoke, very inspiring, euphoric High. Great for socialising Events.”"
