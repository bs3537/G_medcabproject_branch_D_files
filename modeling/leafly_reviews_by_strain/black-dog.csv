Livedog,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1547651,"“Just picked some up at my local dispensary. Wow. Beyond top shelf. They need to install another shelf. Forget your troubles add relax with the D.O.G.”"
azharmparuk,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1541824,"“Perfect for nightime users who love both the indica and sativa effects. This beauty packs a powerful body high and good stimulating cerebral effects. A real hunger buster and leaves you with a dry mouth, so be sure to stay hydrated!”"
wayniac917,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1554713,"“Veteran smoker but even after 2 small bong hits I can feel the effects. Very calming, relaxed high. Probably shouldn't of hit this at 11:45 am. Definitely an evening or lazy day kind of high. Smell is awesome. Citrus/ Berry with a hint of Earthy smell behind it. Taste is pretty much the same. Probably best for pain or stress, but I can tell if I took another bong hit or 2 of this I wouldn't be getting out of my chair...”"
jgilyeatsr,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1573973,"“absolute kick in the face, wow! Was not expecting that and was very, pleasantly surprised. Full body, deep, heavy, relax. Total mental chill. Munchies aren't too bad. Definitely not a lunch toke, total motivation kill. Great smoke before a shower or bed. Five out of four would smoke again.”"
MedJane,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1591984,"“BlackDOG is relaxing & mellow yet not too sedating. Great for binge watching Netflix or hanging with friends. Have plenty of snacks on hand or you’ll eat the entire kitchen. Not for novice tokers ;)   Relatively easy to grow, has large dense buds & a heavy producer. It has a slightly peppery taste & smell. Enjoy”"

Etre.bir,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1576833,"“Me and a friend tried this. Rolled a 1g joint and we had to take a 30 min pause before finnishing that thing. We both have been smoking daily a few years back. Really potent and really good for treating stress, depression, sleeping problems, adhd.”"
ButterSkotch,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1558784,"“This is an excellent nighttime strain. It's great for pain relief and relaxation. I kept catching a hint of black licorice when smoked but that may just be me. Definitely one to check out.”"
supreed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1627479,"“When I smoked it, I wanted to fall asleep asap and it worked. Very euphoric feeling and instant sleepiness.”"
damnit801,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1624135,"“at first taste I had an earthy inhale and more of a berry after taste on the exhale. A really relaxing high. I felt like it's the perfect strain after a long day or a rainy afternoon. Book reading or TV watching high, ya know. body high with a bit of a cerebral kick.”"
Bladerunner1963,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1614134,"“Excellent for relaxation and sleep.”"
_Chief,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1768941,"“purchased as shatter and cannot begin to tell you how heavy this high is.   I'm talking the equivelant of 2 Xanax.  only reason I'm not doing 5 stars is because it did cause a pretty extreme falling backward effect when closing my eyes”"
android159753,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1771633,"“Good strain that gets you high fast but has a terrible flavor”"
HipHempAnonymous,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1788592,"“Black D.O.G. is a wonderful strain that I tried out today. I enjoy the fruity, wild berry notes. Great high that relaxed my body, took the pain edge off, but really put me in a great mood. Felt very focused and talkative. Perfect for a night of binge watching shows/movies. Smooth and light. After 15/20 min you realize this little delight Is potent and really does the trick.”"
ThisOneTimeAtUmass,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1653669,"“Big black looking super frosty buds, up close it's purple against green...pretty. Has a unique grapeish flavor. The buzz is very akin to Hindu Kush, fog clearing, super mellow, zen focus. Decent for daytime if you roll Indicas before sunset, but will get sleepy at high doses.”"
Brainedstrainer25,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1714563,"“Have to say by far one of the best strains I’ve had, bought it dry, amount of crystals on it also is astonishing, really does the job and relaxes you out after a stressful day”"
theburnside,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1569196,"“A great-tasting, strong Indica that's great for depression and appetite and has a nice fully-body high. Black D.O.G. is a strain that's definitely worth vaping with”"

Quwilltron,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1572092,"“Chill AF Strain, 

had a 3°5 and it was dank as... 
recommend having it with others yet it should be fair dank solo smoking.”"
khepra,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1605123,"“Nice strain, pleasant body high but tiring. Made me very hungry”"
Goldenspruce,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-dog/reviews/1658770,"“Interesting... I think "Wet Dog" would suit this strain better. What a crazy unappealing nose!? Smells like a bird cage or cat food :) 

Beautiful nugs, frosty and compact. They look like little spearheaded alien poop. Pretty chill smoke not too strong but solid body buzz with clear head. Would like a wee jar of it on rotation for awhile. Worth a smoke.”"
