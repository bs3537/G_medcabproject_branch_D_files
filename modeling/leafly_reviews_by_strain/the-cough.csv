Bubblejack,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/the-cough/reviews/1361822,"“Used to grow this strain years ago in Portland after it was brought up from Colorado.  What an amazing strain.  It's hazey flavor would stay in your mouth for a few solid minutes after a hit.  If you like haze and sativas then this is one of the best.  Growing it was a dream other then the fact it needed 70'day s at the minimum but the flavor and yields were worth it in the end.  To bad it's not around as much like t...”"

I took 1 rip off my bong ( choaked my ass off) and got an instant head change. Two hits later all stress faded away and my chronic neck pain was gone... Wow, im imperssed, and that don't happen very often”"

lilchiefy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/the-cough/reviews/1361820,"“I love this strain!  After going to school in Fort Collins it was easy to take for granted but for some reason it is hard to find these days.  Living in denver now have finally tracked down a couple clones and look forward to having this available year round.  Top three strain for me.  Achieves a relaxed high that is just perfect whether you want to head outside or couch it.”"

HotelCoralEssex,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/the-cough/reviews/1415378,"“Not sure if this is the proper strain page, but I picked up a strain from Pure dispensary just called "Cough" that was labeled a hybrid...

So far, this strain hasn't given me either a sativa or indica high. Pretty much down the middle (hence it being labeled a hybrid, I suppose). I'm primarily an indica smoker, but wanted to start trying strains that wouldn't make me so sleepy when I wanted to smoke and go out with ...”"
KiyomiChie,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/the-cough/reviews/1547111,"“I will just say this, it wasn't the strain for me. It made me cough uncontrollably, the high made me dizzy, kinda paranoid and a bit nauseous. I couldn't do anything but drank a bunch of water and try to get it out of my system as quick as possible”"
