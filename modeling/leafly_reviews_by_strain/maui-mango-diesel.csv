I tried to take the muscle relaxers and narcotics I was prescribed, but as soon as I got this stuff it was completely non needed. this makes my pain drift away..

BlueDreamerDrew,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/maui-mango-diesel/reviews/1499748,"“The smell of this bud just hits you like a fresh mango to the face. The taste is once again a strong tropical and sweet one with mango being the main bit. This is a good daytime high, I felt immediately relaxed but not tired. This strain made me a little hungry and lightly thirsty. The look of the bud was a nice green with some darker leaves dotting the fluffy nuggs. As for the Keef this strain wasn’t particularly ca...”"

The high is incredibly relaxing but clearheaded. I use it as a day strain and there’s no “dopeyness” to it.
