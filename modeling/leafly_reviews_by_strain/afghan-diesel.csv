Afghan Diesel
=============
Joshy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1233801,"“Just bought a fresh batch of this strain and smoked it with my girlfriend. Definitely should be labeled a Sativa. Head high is dominant when it comes to this Afghan Diesel. Very citrus smelling. A decent tasting strand, not as strong as most of the other strands we've smoked. 7/10.”"

Yardonugz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1270200,"“Absolutely great high. Nice smooth buzz and totally helps my anxiety. Rare for a more sativa based bud but I'm very pleased with this strain. Great smooth taste and a pleasant arouma makes WW one of my favorites”"

badjubies98,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1342471,"“I only took 3 hits from a pipe and I was hella high. I took it with a friend but we had totally different effects. I felt really awake and happy, but she was super tired and relaxed. We were both laughing way too hard at random things. The smell isn't that strong, but it's weird. The lingering smell doesn't really smell like weed, I have no idea how to describe it but when I was high, I was convinced it smelled like ...”"

Xanadab,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1576568,"“Didn't do much for me. Smoked a J on new year's and I had a good time but I wasn't as high as I was planning to be. Probably would be better to buy the best quality to get the best effects from this strain.”"

cancereater,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1347287,"“Smelled of jasmine and grape juice when I opened it.  Has a mild light sweet grape juice taste to it.  The smoke is really smooth and easy to inhale.  Very cerebral top and front of the brain high.  Good for a tasty day time smoke”"

eldankoo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1380067,"“Love this bud, it's very easy going. Don't need a grinder to break it up which is a plus & it's very tasty. Sweet almost. Wrap or glassware, you'll love this”"
hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1653990,"“The perfect balance between active and mellow. A very relaxed and mellow body vibe. It works perfectly with the active and chatty head buzz. You won't be getting a lot done but you won't be falling asleep either. Surrender to the sensations.”"
A.ham,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1290518,"“Nice. Relaxing. I tend toward anxiety. This is a god head high but doesn't bring on anxiety.”"

toptwister75,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1170327,"“It has a nice mellow high.  Really nice to relax with at the end of the day.”"
Wilmer.gayer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1576287,"“Very citrusy on the palatte, but not very effective in terms of mental or body high. I felt like I had to smoke 3 spliffs just to get high. 3 stars because it had a good flavor and wasn't too harsh on my throat.”"
KingIv4,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1761334,"“This is an excellent strain, great taste and the high is very euphoric in my opinion. Great for relaxing and watching movies.”"
SeatownHaze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1215866,"“I really gotta try Afghani by itself one of these days, it's in practically everything. The Sativa half made me just bust out laughing watching funny clips on YouTube and the Indica half made sure I got some great sleep last night. Pick it up if you find it.”"
marijuanaformeditation,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1287517,"“Laughed my ace off after smoking this, both my friend & I enjoyed this strain. Although after a few days of smoking this the effects seem less & less, I love mixing strains in a bowl tho & this was a nice one for that.”"

butterflygrl420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/afghan-diesel/reviews/1229747,"“Part of the deal at Main Street on October 15th, low THC at 15%. Light yet robust green with nice crystals and subtle citrus is fragrant through the plastic pouch. A nice few nugs from Spark farms. 

A super mellow high. An intense bud, yet meelllow. I could handle this at work or before social gathering. That usually means a heavier Indica dominance, in my favor. Again, for me, a lower THC means this is a good strai...”"
