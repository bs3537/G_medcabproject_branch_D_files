5 star!!! 
Slayed stomach ailment. 
Relaxed aching muscles. 
Reduced me into a puddle of joy on the lazyboy contemplating life.”"

But the upside, is that it's bomb. Heady high, with some body effects. Would recommend if you wanna kick back & "forget" the world 😂😂😂”"
HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/memory-loss/reviews/1419390,"“Memory loss is a strain for those who want to get up and go without any physical lag. Felt good 😊 after onset of effects. Strong odor of fruit and incense and a beautiful green color. Best if used for activities like chores or idle time activities like games. After the initial effects subsided, I felt relaxed. Memory loss contains loads of the terpene, caryophyllene. This terpene is good for reducing inflammation, a...”"

I can't get over how amazing this strain actually is. The haze running through it is definitely noticeable. Such a fantastic head change. I was actually very focused and very stoned, a combination hard to come by these days. I highly recommend this strain to everybody! It has been the best sativa I...”"

This did the job (sorta.) I use cannabis both recreationally and medicinally (I suffer from Schizoaffective disorder, BPD, and ADD) and while the body and physical head high are quite enjoyable, having a heavy tingly feeling to them; the way this strain made me feel mentally was not as enjoyabl...”"

HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/memory-loss/reviews/1383432,"“I approached this experience with caution, because the name and purported effects do not express how I like to function when medicated; but the smoke was free so I partook. Smoking through a vaporizer allowed me to discern Memory Loss' aromas. I enjoyed the subtle sweetness of this strain, and after a fee draws from the vape, I became familiar with the cerebral effects it may produce. I was clear headed, and able to ...”"

Dadralph,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/memory-loss/reviews/1356570,"“I picked up this strain on August 8, 2016 from Shango Hillsboro. It definitely lives up to its name. Memory Loss (19.35% THC) – 
•	The first sniff reminded me of breaded fish fillets sprayed with a slice of lemon.  Although not brittle, it was dry to the touch.
•	The buzz begins just behind the eyes and slowly radiates throughout the brain.  My normally happy being is not adversely affected and may be heightened.  Fo...”"

WOW, My new favorite strain. This girl needs a tip and a hug.  Hits fast and nice with a great head high.  Good for my pain from a fractured vertebrae and anxiety and discomfort from chemotherapy.   With me the high lasts a long time.  If you go a bit heavy the memory loss part of the name becomes apparent.  Trust ...”"

SysAdmin420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/memory-loss/reviews/1696563,"“Really awesome strain for listening to some tunes. Serious mind-lock here. Surprisingly mellow, but not sedated. 

Some others have said it is great for after work. I totally agree. That mind-lock coupled with the happiness are a great combination for reflecting on the day. 

I’d say this strain is particularly good for those seeking relief from mood disorders, especially those prone to anger or depression. Additiona...”"
