I would definitely recommended this strain for groups because the conversations are so much better after a hit of this stuff. Eyes got a little dry but that's because I didn't have the urge to blink for like 3 full minutes.”"

CommanderSpork,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/outlaw/reviews/1317201,"“I had my first run-in with this strain in Washington about two weeks ago. I've been smoking for a while, and I feel.....pretty immune. Two hits of this and I'm GONE. 

Wonderfully uplifting, tastes great, hits like a German tank. Couldn't ask for more.”"

RootsWarrior7,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/outlaw/reviews/1248259,"“Golden Xtrx Oil Cartridge of this strain felt amazing. Uplifting, euphoric, and heady with a sweet taste! Highly recommended for any sativa lover!”"
myowngrower,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/outlaw/reviews/1262232,"“In a Golden XTRX pen, this is my absolute day-time favorite. I'm aware and focused -- even maybe a dash creative -- and I'm not "stony," but rather fresh feeling. Also, the munchies are fairly minimal, which is great.
