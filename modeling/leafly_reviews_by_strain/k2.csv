Woppieh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1353656,"“Great weed, i'm getting myself like 3/4 grams a week, since it is not expensive and a great smoke. Recommending to smoke a strong spliff alone with this one:)”"
Tathagata-UK,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1239631,"“I bought an quarter of this, and it looked like it hadn't been dried very well or cured at all. Under the 40x loupe I could see that it had a reasonable amount of clear trichome heads; none were cloudy which indicates to me that it had been harvested early.

After a month of curing there was a skunky smell and a slight piney/fruitiness.

It burned to a clean white ash and was quite smooth, without much taste though. ...”"

65% head, 30% boddy and 5% grounding
I found this strain usefull to solve problems in the mind.

If you follow the mind from a distance, you'll find diferend voices. This is normal, don't panic
The voice that makes the biggest problem at this moment is the one to focus on.
Because of the 65% head this would be easy... to put them in the flow of the movements... 30% boddy... and pu...”"
thijs1981nl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1356006,"“K2 shoots me off into the air and gives a euphoric yet relaxed high. I consider it my laughing weed since I laugh at everything while smoking it. The taste is  citrus-like and it's sometimes a bit hard on the throat. Overall a must try, if you can get it.”"
ScottishToker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1231993,"“This was a very good strain it had a very pungent earthy taste to it which I favour and was a very smooth inhale/exhale it gave me a great relaxing high but I think the sativa side made me quite anxious which I didn't enjoy but overall this is a good strain”"

TheDoubleJ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1276849,"“It's been a long time before I ran into this strain. Always good reviews about this weed. Very strong strain and fulfilled all the expectations. Extremely dense buds with a nice smell. Covered in small, detailed hairs and looks promising. Strong buzzing feeling with great body high. Taste is pretty good. Good for relaxation but prepare to get your ass kicked by this one.”"
medician,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1389837,"“This strain took me right out of my body (great for pain) and straight into my head (bad for anxiety).”"
cascadianmass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1192506,"“Very piney, with a good strong Indica buzz, and nice smell. The taste is an even stronger pinene flavoring, and only has minimal hints of limonine. Very good for those who like their herbs to smell like trees. It's lineage is good and strong, Hindu Kush x White Widow, and I do enjoy both those strains from time to time.”"

BanginB,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1159479,"“If you smoke a gram with a friend or to yourself it will feel great. If you smoke like a bow or two you will get the following. I got excited, because of the white widow. Sure it got me moving, but I was paranoid of my actions and/or what I was going to say. The hindu kush will get you an appetite, but i found myself not liking the food i usually enjoy when high off of other indicas. It isn't bad. I just prefer other...”"

ZAKKATTACK316,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1290794,"“Smoked this stuff a while back out of my pipe, to me it was no different than the regular shit but the high lasted somewhat longer. Real earthy taste with a real strong smell. The smell was sort of misleading in a way, maybe I just picked up a crappy batch of this stuff but overall this strain is somewhat decent.”"
indicaG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1302623,"“Really heavy on the body helps after a training session but not good before just makes you want to relax. Heavy high great for watching a movie”"

oskuweli,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1437380,"“I just fell in love with this strain. I have severe anxious problems and this is answer for my problems. Makes me very giggly, relaxed and slightly euphoric. Deep headspace, like said earlier.

Very mellow and fruity smell!
 Actual high is mellow but kind of anxious, if i smoke only one bowl.
But in higher amounts it makes me feel good and relaxed. My anxiousness is gone thanks to this lovely strain.”"
NoWeedNoPete,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1583430,"“Really strong high, starts relaxing, ends in a couch-lock. get a really dry mouth every time I smoke this strain.

SafetyLast,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/k2/reviews/1686404,"“Compact mostly dark green buds, smell is not really clear or heavily present. The taste is hard to define as well, a bit earthy and woody, leaving a burning sensation at the top of the throat, wich is also the only real spot for cottonmouth. The effects are 'just chill', they're not heavy or overpowering, I can easily have two spliffs of this and not feel paranoid or completely couchlocked. Which is typical for this ...”"

I smoked a bowl of this strain a few minutes after waking to increase my appetite and reduce nausea.  My nausea quickly disappeared which allowed me to get ready for work with no set backs and I was ready for breakfast 30 minutes later (breakfast can be a task with my symptoms).
The K2 made me feel happy relaxed and I felt a pretty standard appetite incr...”"
