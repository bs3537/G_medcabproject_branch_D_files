Strawberry Dream
=============
Cannalush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1374370,"“Great Daytime strain. Smells mildly sweet and nutty with a hint of berry. Smoke is so smooth, no cough and a sweet aftertaste. Great medicating strain for depression and anxiety.”"
4hundred20warspersecond,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1354165,"“This strain makes me very uplifted and want to be around people more, actually talking to them, even online :P. You'll have slight to moderate dry mouth, but it gets really dry if you decide to party. The munchies and/or arousal don't set in until right before your plateau, and the arousal is never as vivid as the hunger; these are very chill and slow as compared to the oncoming of the high.”"
sweetbutter80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1414256,"“Starwberry Cream makes me happy, horny & sleepy. Works great for pain/nausea/insomnia. NO ANXIETY/PARANOIA (a must). Head high heavy but that's what I needed. Body high just what I needed as well. Nuff said; highly recommend for nighttime/bedtime use!”"
Sapphyy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1414255,"“I got a super purple batch of this strain.. which i'm assuming comes from the Blue Dream. Overall look i give a 10/10 - It's super light green with patches of purple throughout. Covered in trichs. Smell? Fruity. Kinda like strawberrys. (Pushing it) Taste? Exactly how it smells. Super smooth smoke and a super enjoyable high. Very Creative and Euphoric. Colors seemed extremely vivid. I would suggest this medicinally fo...”"
John_6688,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1354166,"“Great strain for day time. Clear mind and energetic with antidepressant effects. Tart smell with pleasant taste. Don't pass up the opportunity to try the strawberry dream.”"
LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1372282,"“This is an amazing cross, very very calm high and it tastes just like Strawberry with a hint of Blue Dream. It seems to be best for Anxiety, Pain, Bi Polar, Insomnia. It is definitely a must try for all as it will easily climb to your top 3-5. Definitely recommend it to Noobies and Vets, enjoy this bud people it's very good! Peace.”"
WavyGreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1605779,"“By far one of the best sativa dominant hybrids out there. Smokes sweet with hints of strawberry and gum on the front end and a almost sweet pine on the exhale. Effects are strong but can still focus and get some things done. Also great in vape cartridges and edibles. Highly recommended”"
Cannalush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1162582,"“Strawberry Dream is an excellent strain for depression. Buds are dense and frosty with trichomes. Smells sweet with hint of fruit and citrus. Smoke is smooth and slight sweet aftertaste. Clear headed stone, Very energetic. Great medicating strain for depression and daytime use.”"
trpc21,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1313232,"“My personal favorite. Very heavy hitting, you'll want to sleep for sure afterwards. The high lasts a long time, and progresses with time. Little cotton mouth despite the strength.”"
carlsagan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1368130,"“You get that “hazy” cerebral high but you also get a relaxed stoned body It's amazing tasting but that harsh cough lung expansion kind of sucks was unexpected. The coughing fit did make me feel like I was gonna cough up phlegm. Uncomfortable for a little bit. I wouldn't classify it as a Paranoia type high on the onset. But more of a slight “on edge”. Not racy. The cerebral effects were awesome as the harshness escape...”"
sweetbutter80,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1354144,"“I had an indica dominant hybrid of Strawberry Dream. Had a migraine comin on when I medicated round 2200 or so? Pain/nausea gone within 10 min. Don't remember much about taste or if there was any anxiety or not. I fell asleep pretty fast. Head buzz very heavy; you are goin to sleep on this! Body high dang near perfect. Highly recommend for nighttime use. :-)”"
LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1243036,"“This is a very very good strain that definitely puts you where you want to be. This is a very nice cross that totally everyone should try! Seems to be best for Anxiety, Pain, Insomnia, Spasms. Definitely a must try as it will easily climb to your top 3 or 5!”"
ApatheticThug,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1354145,"“A cross between Strawberry Kush and Blue Dream. Very strong aroma of strawberries when burned. Soothing to the throat and great body high”"
chokertoker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1576468,"“This strain is so awesome it actually made me write a review on Leafly. I smoke mostly for a mood boost and motivation and this checks all my boxes . It's almost underwhelming in a sense... you think with all these reviews  you would be stoned but I feel wonderfully content right now. Absolutely no anxiety or paranoia. Super chill, happy, not couch locked. In fact it prompted a happy cleaning binge for me. Easily a f...”"
Shayn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1497550,"“Nice, mellow; my girlfriend said she felt “Giggly”, then she went into a forward fold as I sat beside her chilling for well over five minuets until she finally came up and said “Wow, I really like this Herb.” Keep in mind, she normally smokes CBD, only took one hit (lil baby bong rip), and now she’s completely passed out. Night Night :)
Meanwhile, I’m fond of indica, but, because I really enjoy the Smell, Taste, and ...”"

nosta,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1504857,"“Found an oz in Boulder grown by Locol Love. One of my top 5 all-time for the following reasons.
Aesthetics. Bud structure was insanely dense and trimmers removed 100% of the non-desirable leaves, with only potent StrawberryxDream to consume.
Smell. The strawberry scent escapes the jar first, teasing you with a soft but present aroma. The dream packs a punch, right behind it and sticks around, lingering to remind you ...”"

coop1211,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1148020,"“This strain was good my only complaint was that it is kinda harsh especially if its on the dryer side.  Given the fact that it is not very pungent you would expect it to not taste that great but it is kinda earthy with a little citrus not much.  It does however knock u out if your already tired so its good for people taking it easy that need rest.”"

alkleenmibaz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1476521,"“If you like something that helps with your sleep or just soreness from a day at the gym, this is the one for you. However, this was not smoked as a bud, but purchased as an applicator for vaping. Much more potent in an extract form and no strong smell lingering around the house.....or job. I was not quite sure if I would like the vaping, but it's great for those moments you can't just break out the bong and go to tow...”"

mellowmoodgotme,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/strawberry-dream/reviews/1176933,"“Strawberry dream from Doctor Orders is really good! I got it high like in minutes and instantly good stoned feeling. I love sativas dominants hybrids, this one is smooth high. At first to smoke it's gets harsh hit in the throat so overall the strain itself is awesome. I am glad I picked that strain. 👍🏼👍🏼”"
