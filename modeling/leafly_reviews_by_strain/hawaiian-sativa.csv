You slowly feel as if you are having a very vivid dream of a memory. The strain brings back memories depending on the outside stimuli. In other words, if you listen to a certain song, you will have memories of the time when you first listened to that song. 
--Sight: Colors are very pleasant. Everything seems...”"

I smoked several bowls of this by myself and I was left having closed eye visuals and open eye visuals and had music playing in my head. I would not recommend it to beginners because I smoked it from a steamroller at one point and the high was super intense even for me.”"

Please for the love of all that is holy, someone point me in the right direction. All I can find is federation seeds but I believe they are no longer operating. Send me a link peeps! Thanks!”"

ManRay,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/hawaiian-sativa/reviews/1195082,"“4.2/5 Smoked one bowl from medium sized bubbler. Effects were quick to onset. Mostly a head high that only marginally mellows the body. Very trippy and similar to other pure sativas such as Durban Poison. Despite this particular strains lower THC content the high is strong. As of right now the head is flying while the body waits.”"

I feel super creative when smoking this, I definitely organize my thoughts easier. This is a great one to smoke before work.”"
