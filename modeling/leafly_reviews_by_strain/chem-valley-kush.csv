Chem Valley Kush
=============
intolerable1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1363107,"“SPIRIT LIFTER. Although dealing with major depression this week and fighting suicide ideation, this brought my spirits up. Probably wouldn't do this (or any sativas) on an average day due to my high energy ADHD. But Grateful I had this on hand. Because I was so low it brought me up enough to shed the bad and enjoy my evening with out being agitated.”"
VergilTheCat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1378533,"“I'm no Tommy Chong, but I've had a fair share of herb in my lifetime, and this is absolutely the strongest strain I have EVER had.  Supposedly tested at a whopping 30% THC, I was so euphoric I couldn't talk much for the first hour, which is a rare thing for me, indeed.
If you are looking for an almost 100%-sativa experience, this is for you.  Super crystal clear cerebral euphoria.  Supremely elevated out of any kind ...”"
heyitsenso,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1410732,"“DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU HAVE A SENSORY PROCESSING DISORDER. I do and good god what an awful strain on my senses. Everything is amplified and made more sensitive. Great on low days but still too much in certain areas. Tasted like pickles.”"
BobCantwell,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1344457,"“Turned my brain into pure plasma that shot out of my toes. I must have chocolate cake!”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1411665,"“Takes a second, but an exceptional come on starts kicking in. It refreshes your senses, clears your perceptions out and makes you feel fresh and energized with huge amounts of mood elevation. Wide-eyed vision like Jack strains, but there’s also a physical sensation to the eyes. Not distracting, but curiously noticeable. Difficult to concentrate on things when looking at them, eyes prefer to relax and not focus on any...”"
Pskully57,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1151976,"“Has a delicious pine tar flavor with a hint of nag champa, aged parchment, and sage. Nice, chunky, frosty nugs. Very cerebral, hits right away. Quite intense, but wears off fairly quick. The Indica properties hang out a while, however. Can definitely function, but eventually the couch lock will kick in after a few sessions. Good pain suppression. Overall, I liked it and so did my spazzing back muscles.”"

Flower, one hitters bro...?! No joint rolling...This is breakfast and its not a buffet! Check it, I need to dry out a bit. I can only get high, HIGH in the fuckin mornings man?! Hot stepping strain...beware, some chicks are really not that hot when you're sativa whacked, I smoked some indica, l...”"
BLAZINrightNOW,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1295564,"“good strain for stress relief on the go. I was expecting a lil more of the kush in the taste but had more of a chemdawg taste... Which isn't a bad thing tho. The high is rather clear headed and productive without couchlock or paranoia for me. 😁”"
Buckeye_Mark,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1351831,"“Chem Valley is a really nice sativa leaning strain that I picked up at Panacea on Sandy. It was a nice energy giver that made me feel really nice. I jumped up and cooked dinner and got ready for Agents of Shield. Smoked another bowl and had a great time escaping reality for a few. This is one of the nicest highs I've had yet here in Portland.”"
OCHObabies,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1263682,"“This strain is great. I feel super talkative and happy. I wish I bought more tho. Super cheap too only $6 a gram. Out of all the weed I've smoked, this one has a flavor I've never tasted. It's almost minty. I really dig this one. 20% thc”"
DurbanTurban,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1184871,"“Spicy and Kushy and looked a lot like some white widow strains that I have picked up before.  The taste was citrusy and fruity and left me with a comfortable and well balanced high, while not overwhelmingly potent :)”"
FCSophia,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1350804,"“Easily one of my favorite strains. Despite being an indica and having the #1 effect be sleepiness, I find this to be a very controllable high. If you smoke this and get up and get moving you'll get a ton of work done and have a bunch of fun while doing it, but if you sit down and just chill out then you'll get super sleepy and have the most peaceful sleep ever.”"
Reapa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1263873,"“Hits pretty fast but doesn't last long although overall I really liked this strain.”"
olletnaS,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1330840,"“This is a Sativa-Dominant strain (85% Sativa - 15% Indica). This strain is a cross between: SFV OG and Chem Dawg (2 very potent strains). Strong aromas and tastes like lemon Pledge furniture polish will be noticed.  On a scale of 1-10 for potency, this should be about a 9.4. This strain should not be passed up. Very great!”"

juneleaf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chem-valley-kush/reviews/1337542,"“I'm not a fan. I suffer from chronic migraines and other body pain issues and smoking CVK is like throwing lighter fluid on the fire. Its a very heavy stone and really amps up any pain I'm having. And if I wasn't already in pain before smoking, there's a pretty good chance I will be after. I also seem to get a hangover from it. 

I smoked this for quite a while since it was very accessible for me before figuring out ...”"

This will stink up a room, i keep some on my dresser, it stunk up my whole room. Headzie at the start, which takes time to kick in, Creeper, finish is coach lock burn out. Overall all a must try, just for that funky pu na na odor. Also sex was long lasting and great.

The strain is very good though. Very sativa like stone. Just an all around fuzzy stoned feeling. Very comforting. 
the taste is almost not even noticeable. Very light. Smooth hitting from the bong and the pipe.”"
