Super Lemon's super-power is getting you Monkey Balls high for hours at a time.

tstump,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-lemon-og/reviews/1413411,"“Very dense nugs. Strong citrus and lemon smell. Hit incredibly smooth, tasted strong of lemon. Nice head rush soon after exhale. Overall very relaxed high, while I was stuck on my couch for an extended amount of time, I was still able to feel the sativa effects. "Functional-couchlock" is the best term I can use. Recommended for night time use, however not before bed.”"
Hatfield5225,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-lemon-og/reviews/1415027,"“I just tried this strain for the first time and will be seeking it out in the future as an amazing strain for concentrates. The flavor is intense, starting of sweet and ending in a spicy lemon deisel flavor. It left me clear headed, very relaxed with a very pleasant not overwhelming body high. Definetly a new favorite.”"

BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-lemon-og/reviews/1415028,"“I got a LB of this a while back and I'll say few strains I can remember as well as this one.  The aroma/taste was that of lemon candy very pleasing.  The effects were heavy bodied, fuzzy/Hazey goofy high.  Definitely that stoned can't remember shit, walking around in circles kind of high.  A good strain for netflixing & chilling.”"
janet47,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-lemon-og/reviews/1414095,"“Although i had some problems with the taste (found it quite harsh when smoked with zig zag papers) but the effects make up for it. Intense effects to get you uplifted and more confident. I bought a nice amount of this strain when i visited the club and i found myself using it most when i knew i would be in social situations ( since it seemed to have worked amazingly with my anxiety/social anxiety)”"

The smell is complex, rich, some petroleum hints, cep't earthier, more pine.. I could live in a forest of this, forever.. And oh baby, this mule has got some kick! Nice... I'm a seasoned veteran, long years on the vap daily, plus an athlete... so lungs pull huge. This strain is so smooth. Nice body buzz, but the mind, untouc...”"

IThinkWereParkedMan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-lemon-og/reviews/1414094,"“I love this strain. Equal amount of sativa & indica. For me the indica and sativa highs balance out throughout my high. It made me energetic & happy. I could smoke this daily.”"
americanmary,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-lemon-og/reviews/1396122,"“This strain is cheesy and dope. Best way to describe it is to think about all those times you get high and think of cool shit but cant remember them the next day right?  This is the strain that reminds you to write those ideas down, your welcome tho.”"
CannibalCarni,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/super-lemon-og/reviews/1352917,"“I was disappointed by this strain. I hit a peak high in only 20-30 minutes and quickly mellowed out. Never felt much of a mind high, certainly more of a body high. It made me extremely dizzy. My smoke was unpleasantly harsh, possibly the harshest I've had.
On the positives, the weed really relaxed me, I was giggly and very chatty. Good with others.
4* Body, 2*Mind, 2.9* Potency (Out of 5*)”"

The buds are green with a blueish tint and lots of yellow mixed in. The effects are very unique, giving a stronng mellowing body high, one that youd expect heavy couchlock to follow, but the haze genetics keep you from drifiting off. It was a high i had never felt before, and thats rare after smoki...”"

Not a lot of info available from others (online).  From personal experience, I would describe this as a strong euphoria, followed by body tingling and total body and mind happiness. After the initial high, you continue to get higher and higher gradually, feeling more and more engulfed in "floatiness". Completely pleasurable, occasionally silly.”"
