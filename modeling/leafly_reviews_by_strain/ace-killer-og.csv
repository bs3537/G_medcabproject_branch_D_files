It's 8:32 am, and I've just done the unthinkable...I inhaled 3 big hits of, "Ace Killer Og."  No worries though....I've done it for scientific research, to get the full effects of this strain right out of the sack, and judging by the increasing sloppiness of my handwriting, (I'm writing this longhand on a yellow legal pad to be transcribed on computer), it's sending a profound message:
"I am strong; I am mi...”"

Be ready! it is not for everyone (but  yet everyone must try it at least once or as much as you can handle or-enjoy;)) and you must do it asap.  You will have to travel to LA, CA to get the Real OG but its known that this strain is been spreading out through out the world and soon to hit every local (respectful) dispensary world wide. Enjoy My GFriends”"

EmileAjar,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ace-killer-og/reviews/1366468,"“That shit was STRONG. A little diesel taste to it. I was completely high after a couple hits. I felt very relaxed but surprisingly not sleepy at all. Pungent as hell. Munchies were a MESS. Couldn't recall the last time I ate like that after a buzz. Don't think it's so great for day-time but a perfect sunday chilling at home strain.”"

JoshLoc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/ace-killer-og/reviews/1361421,"“I found this similar to GG#4 in that it's really gassy and it gives that headband type high like all fuel strains. Instead of the heavy body stone though, it has more of a skunk/cheese body warming/relaxing feel. I try to have a fuel strain on hand for daytime anxiety, this would not be my first choice but i would get it if I couldn't find GG#4 or a Sour D cross. Plus who can pass on anything bred by DNA.”"
