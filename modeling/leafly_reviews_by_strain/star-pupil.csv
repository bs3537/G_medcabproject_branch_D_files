tlultuce,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/star-pupil/reviews/1560426,"“This strain is awesome, super good vibes. One of the more potent purple strains, and a fun grow! It is always purple from the onset of flower, no cold temperatures needed. Leafly, please fix your incorrect info. Also, it was bred by Mass Medical Strains. The seeds the parents came from were given to them as is common knowledge, they popped the seeds and made the cross, and hunted the Star Pupil from the offspring.”"

Mattnaughton85,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/star-pupil/reviews/1783912,"“General Notes:

Incredible dark purple color that almost makes the leaf look burnt to someone new to cannabis.

Strain gives a very heady high but didn’t seem to impair cognition (at least initially).

There is some body high but not as strong as the head high.

Dosage:

1 stuffed cigarette pipe left me feeling pretty, pretty, pretttttttttttttty good but in control.”"
