ICED Grapefruit

Tinkerbelles,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1371580,"“I have tried many strains to find this one. For me, it does more for my chronic nausea, migraines, pain, and stress than any other strain. Nothing else has come close. I found some that helped for awhile then didn't. This is my Energizer Bunny; it keeps working for me. Just one hit is all it takes to dampen pain and make it so I can eat. But, please don't buy it on the west coast. I need it all. I'm kidding. Just sav...”"
levitaylor78,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1415175,"“grown well this bud produces thick and heavy nuts.  The smell she gives off is delicious during flower. scents of grape then the grapefruit powers through. 
A good anytime smoke for me can leave me a little sedated tho after a toke too many and a head rush. good for pain and social activity if not abused”"
TCRKM,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1371332,"“head high, laughed alot, probably annoyed others”"
McSplif,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1346641,"“nice day time strain.  while I received "Super ICED Grapefruit" from my local dispensary. this is the closest strain.  Super flavorful looks a little weird.  like color wise.  but smoke is very nice.  I'm notorious for mixing my strains and I love love love blue dream and the iced grapefruit together.  Nice heady stone.  no couch lock at all.  Super uplifting.  great hybrid worthy of your smoke session.”"
Koopday,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1729220,"“4.6  Very relaxing and personally good for my anxiety.  Truly a bit of a body high as well, could be couchlock style if smoked in excess at all. Solid taste and nice fresh subtle fruit smell-but I'm in it for the effects. Only downside is it definitely makes me hungry which most people like for some reason but munchy weed can make my stomach feel empty when it isn[t.”"
nickrazza,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1369196,"“Ice cools with the inhale, Grapefruit complenting the smell and aroma more. Nugs, if grown well, should be dense, larger heavy triched, med length orange hairs brush over the bud & smell is a pungent, but cool and fresh stink.
4/5”"
Pringle710,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1302319,"“It makes you very happy and positive. It's a great strain to have at social gatherings”"
missprice,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1334825,"“Ive been debating for a hot minute if I like LIKE LIKE this strain or just like. First, you're gonna get stoned not totally...well not at first.  But eventually.  Its creep weed. Taste is lemony and has a woodsy aftertaste. Smells hella funky, but in a good way. Pretty buds, most were fluffy with red veins throughout.”"
NoCo970,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1357845,"“This strain is a hidden gem and admittedly have skipped on it many times due to the claim of benefits, and Sativa leaning label from leafly. The strain I got was definitely not a Sativa leaning hybrid but more a 50/50 and can be felt in the face, behind the eyes, just down right more indica. I would categorize this strain with Blue Dream as it can energize or relax you, but with a higher potency. Smells of sweet hash...”"
boone62,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1224356,"“Glad to see this strain listed!

Again, very nice strain when grown right.”"

snaz567,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1331135,"“I bought this from Heritage Organics in Pueblo West for a daytime/active strain.  It was a good, uplifting high.  Not nearly as energetic as Green Crack or Kronos the White,  or as uplifting as Flo, but still above average effects.”"

Naetoven,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1328663,"“This strain definitely had its sativa moments as well as its indica. within 20 min of me smoking the flower, I felt motivated to sort laundry and start dinner early. however within two hours of flower smoke I felt the body high. its slowly creeps up on you and its calming. For me this strain did what I needed it to.”"

Not overpowering leaves me with a nice head high where I can think but I really relaxed. Dry mouth big time on this one for me but it helps with pain and leaves me calm. Even after I come down I feel relaxed and well.”"
PhantomSpaceman,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1261794,"“I grabbed this strain because I wanted to try out some more sativa dominant hybrids. I enjoy this strain a lot for it's euphoric effects. As good hybrids tend to do, it brought me to a really trippy headspace that's fun in groups. The downside I found with this one is that it's a little on the sedating side, which becomes noticeable when the euphoria tapers off. I also found the flavor to be on the earthy side, which...”"

Sublime1993,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/iced-grapefruit/reviews/1348392,"“A good high. Ice Grapefruit gave a good energizing head rush and had good focus. There is a good relaxing body high along with it that's not too strong but will get stronger later on. This could be use for anytime of the day imo. 
As for medical use it's good for fatigue, pain, and excellent for depression. And this could be a decent anti anxiety but maybe not for everyone.”"

Nice bag appeal and a breeze to grow. It smelled so good I kept calling it Tropical Ice it was more of a mango grapefruit mix. small buds grew in the center of the fan leaf never seen that happen b4 looked cool. The only thing I disliked was the duration it had no legs.. lol. Good daytime Sativa Dom strain for sure....”"
