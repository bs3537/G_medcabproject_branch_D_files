No it isn't purple or fruit flavored, in fact, it smells down right piney.  2 TINY meant to be one hitter bowls (tiny temp plastic bong) were more than happy to MELT pain i didn't realize i had until my back cracked in 10 places......but dont be fooled.

I tried Afgooey first and wasn't paying close attention the second time I acquired it and was about to be disappointed at the inconsistency!  I thought Afgooey had let me down for pain relief!

sweetleafgirl,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgooey/reviews/1416003,"“Excellent for any type of pain and stress. Pain and stress goes away with the first hit. Stays gone for at least 4 hours. If you have insomnia, take one hit and you won't have it anymore. Great nighttime strain. If you stay home sick from pain, get some Afgooey, stretch out on the couch and watch your favorite movie!! You'll love your day!”"

danktank13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgooey/reviews/1416007,"“I have tried this variety and so far enjoyed it.  The flowers are dense, dark with orange hairs and very sticky. It has a sharp scent that to me is of citrus with a hint of skunk.  Smoking it was pleasant and I found it gentle on my lungs.  It does produce very milky smoke and it kept a fruity taste finishing with a hint of pepper.

Sitting back, relaxing and able to function and was in a creative state to where I began to write a couple of poems for my journal.  Highly recommend.  Also was able to function during the day, when I reduced my dosage to be able to function at work.  Pick up at Yavapai Herbal in Cottonwood, My favorite place.”"

The heavy body feeling of indica is extremely strong in this strain.  

The effects come on gradually and not instantly, but it isn't what I would call creeper because you do feel the effects right way.  They just intensify over time.

Effects last 2-3 hours depending on dosage.”"

DunDun,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgooey/reviews/1196815,"“High doesnt last too long. Does make u tired and relaxed but also I've had an energy kick from it too. Very stoney, lazy red eyes. Great for a day to do nothing but kick back relax n watch movies.”"

Jaylien,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgooey/reviews/1374349,"“The gooey is aptly named, this stuff was so sticky that it went into the grinder with a gummy *squish*, and had trouble falling through the holes into the flower chamber.  Very pungent earthy aroma, not a very notable taste.  A pretty standard indica high but a good one.  No paranoia or anxiety or discomfort.”"

This bud had me relaxed with out being couch-locked. I felt the stress melt away and had a happy, euphoric high. I'd recommend for people with anxiety and stress. Felt like I was on a porch swing with the sun on my face ☺️🌤”"
StonedFaux,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgooey/reviews/1306835,"“This indica hits hard and quick. Long high. Smells and tastes like Black Tea. Intense relaxation and even sleepiness, however, no couch lock.
Only drawback is the EXTREMELY dry mouth.”"
cosmiic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgooey/reviews/1317001,"“This strain was highly sedating, maybe more than ideal. It's good for before bed and did I sleep very soundly, but I would not smoke this unless dealing with insomnia.”"
