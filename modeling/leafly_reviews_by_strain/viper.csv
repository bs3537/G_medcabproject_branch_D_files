mattny,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/viper/reviews/1411079,"“Very strong, cerebral buzz. Mind erasing, stress relieving. Buzz slowly encompasses the body creating a full body relaxing experience. I've heard people say viper will burn you out but honestly I believe the high is meant to start of soaring and energetic. If you can handle sativas this one is great for treating symptoms of anxiety and depression. I really wish there were more of these amazing landrace crosses availa...”"

vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/viper/reviews/1348940,"“Bought t it as "Blue Viper", almost identical to the same named strain last year. Pungent floral spiciness with just enough cheesecake to open the nostrils. The vapour was even more pungent. Mild vapor both in and exhale.   

This stuff goes right to my ears, and head. That wonderful sensitivity to sound  is great for music and natural sounds but not for city noise.  For pain, it is more distracting than dulling, if ...”"

I lit up a bowl at 1:00am and after the first inhale, felt an insane body high. I kept hitting it and never felt tired. Based on the texts I was sending to my friends back home, it was definitely a creative/funny high.”"

MsCannaGeek,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/viper/reviews/1343910,"“Currently dabbing on some super terpy Viper Nug rug. It was recommended to me by my dispensary for my chronic pain . As always they weren't wrong. Viper is a nice sativa that reaches your head on impact then a nice warm  body buzz envelopes you. I will say that a little goes a long way.  Too much seems to bring out a couch lock.  I highly recommend for pain relief and is mood uplifting, watch out for anxiety with thi...”"

Sage880,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/viper/reviews/1476987,"“This shit is crazy. You smoke it and you're like BAM sober. Viper gives you a last glance at everything for it takes it all away. Then you're fucked. You're not making sense. But no one knows you're yelling nonsense because they're yelling nonsense too. Your dog might be pooing and you're like stumbling forward pulling him out of the poo stance. That fucked.”"

shabash696,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/viper/reviews/1573059,"“Mind wandering strong cerebral head buzz.  Too much physical anxiety for me, but I'm an Indica predominant fan.  The flavor is very nice and a single hit sent me coughing, so the potency is there.  If you like sativas, I would recommend it.”"
shadowfaz16,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/viper/reviews/1575949,"“Very, very good strain. Besides provides strong energising and uplifting effects, this high sativa is a local favourite in Vancouver (at leat I used to sell it a lot at the dispensary I work at) mainly because of its strong creative effects. Even high tolerance smokers can agree this is a good one for people looking for the definition of tripping without falling asleep! I’d totally recommend it if you come across it!...”"

LisaJ1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/viper/reviews/1806758,"“This is the perfect strain to kill a workout, jog/run, hike, etc. It definitely puts a stop to the “lazy stoner” stereotype. Great for a cyph with your homies bc it leads to a lot of conversation and get a nice lively vibe going. Kinda reminds me of blue dream, just a more defined high. Highly recommend!!!!”"

VanIslandCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/viper/reviews/1375317,"“Smoked this out of a joint; nice cheese flavour with a hint of skunk and pine. I noticed this strain is definitely a creeper that is initially stimulating in the body  before its effects on the mind come through. One of the best sativa dominant hybrids out there, I can see why it costs more than the average eighth!”"
