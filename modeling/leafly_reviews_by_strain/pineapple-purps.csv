This one is definitely at the top of my list.”"

One of the best I ever had , if not THE. It's super duper sticky.. u don't feel me.. I mean reeeaally sticky like glue! The smoke is thick . I feel great!”"
BeZerkaveli,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-purps/reviews/1355264,"“This is a very strong strain. Even with a high tolerance, this strain really knocks you on your ass. My friend got so high he puked all over himself. It's so strong I really wouldn't recommend just ripping a huge bowl of this if you have not smoked in a while. The taste is very good, almost pineapple or citrus of some kind. It's a pretty green tone laced with patches of purple. If you get lucky enough to try this, ge...”"

sick_as_clique,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/pineapple-purps/reviews/1479901,"“The bud itself is one of the coolest looking I've ever seen. Some of the nugs were completely black! The smell reminds me of berries and is unique to this strain. 

The high itself had me making great jokes and super giggly. Great high if you're going to a party or looking to spark some  conversation with friends.”"
