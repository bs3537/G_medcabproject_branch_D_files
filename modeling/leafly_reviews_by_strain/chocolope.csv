magicmanfk,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolope/reviews/1417868,"“The buzz itself doesn't last for super long, but it leaves you with a feeling of optimism, happiness, and motivation that lasts for a really long time afterwards (at least three hours AFTER the buzz dies down). It's the most clear-headed high I've ever had, and by far the best motivator strain if I ever need to get anything done. If you want a strain that helps you actually accomplish things this is the way to go.”"

I have Charcot-Marie-Tooth and PTSD.

It'll perk you right up and keep you happy for hours.

The smoke is smooth and flavorful. The inhale feels sweet but is replaced by a slightly bitter taste similar to dark chocolate on the exhale. This is my favorite part of this strain because I love that...”"

medicinalreview,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/chocolope/reviews/1230755,"“hybrid 20g 1love. clean smoke, not too much expansion or coughing. taste is a dirty but not unpleasant taste. Not too Chocolaty, but would say more chocolate that cantaloupe, I didn't taste the cantaloupe much but a small hint of it when sniffing the buds. Overall a clean, pleasant, not to heavy high. More of a body high than a head high.

I stiff bowl and clean headed, not sleepy, good for work or play.”"
