sadiejane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1410796,"“I tried this in a disposable oil pen and loved it. Amazing for PTSD related symptoms and for muscle pains and spasms associated with opiate withdrawal. Been going through a brutal methadone detox, and this has been amazing at stopping anxiety, chills/cold sweats and blocking some of the muscular pain while remaining clear headed.”"
APalm,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1410795,"“Developed by Jason Cranford of the Flowering HOPE Foundation, this CBD-rich flower has been a blessing to the medical cannabis community.  Aromas of pine, lemongrass, and a slight muskiness fill the air when the seal is broken.  Otherwise known as "HH Red" in Connecticut (stop laughing at us, by law dispensaries can't list the "street name" aka genetics).  A big thank you to April and the team from Curaleaf to bring ...”"

CT_Patient_Reviews,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1410793,"“Right From the beginning you get a tickling sensation from the predominantly funky smell, paired with subtle notes of earthy pine, and a slight lingering sour-fruit finish.   I'm medicating Curaleaf's HH Red, which tests at a roughly 50/50 CBD:THc ratio (13% and 10% respectively). The buds are perfectly cured, able to crumble in your fingers but nice and sticky!”"
franschan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1410792,"“Amazing strain, I have been picking it up as long as it has been in stock in CT, which has been a few months now, and me my sister with Fredricks Ataxia, a rare muscular disease, finds that it helps calm her body and relax her, even help her walk a bit better. Would recommend!”"
HighermathCT,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1410790,"“I love this strain, never thought I would go for CBD but wow, this is great. I hope one day soon anyone who wants relaxation, pain relief, and fantastic sleep will have access to high quality CBD products.”"
Zalavis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1410784,"“I picked this up from my local medical marijuana shop, and this may be my new favorite strain. I'm very prone to THC induced anxiety, and this stuff if the first strain in 3 months to not give me THC induced paranoia/anxiety. Its 7% THC and 13% CBD, and it started off with a blanket of mild euphoria and complete happiness. Very floaty, but not overpowering what so ever. This strain gets 5 stars from me.”"
ScissorJam90,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1410791,"“Floaty relaxed high - really good for anxiety and body pain. I have a shaking problem due to an addiction to xanex and klonopin and this strain helps my nerves calm down and stop the shaking. Works great for ptsd symptoms too”"
Snackyonassis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1410789,"“I really enjoy this strain. It comes on really subtle and is really great for crowd anxiety. I tried this before a concert and it was amazing. I had a great time, i really got into the music, the crowd didn't bother me at all and I was able to stay energetic!”"
AJG1979,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1411000,"“Using for my sons epilepsy in tincture form. Switched to this from Charlottes Web . Both have kept seizures away. Notice less anxiety and agitation with HH in comparison. Very happy with this so far.”"

I have spinal cord damage at the C5 location causing horrible pain and inability to walk for long. This really gives me some Much-needed reprieve from the pain thank you Curleaf!!”"
onmytiptoes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1571552,"“One of my favorites! I take HH in a disposable vape pen and an edible oil. It’s super helpful for muscle spasms and pain from my MS. I originally tried it hoping it would help me through a bout of insomnia, and woke up the next morning feeling such relief in my neck and shoulders, which have been tight and spasming lately. I’ve been using it ever since and it’s really helping, while leaving me clearheaded enough to g...”"

About 2 years ago I had a complete meltdown from a weed of one of my friends. Complete paranoia and anxiety, even texted my dad that I loved him at 2am cause I thought I was dying
Ever since that day I've been deathly afraid of weed until a friend of mine gave me this stuff, and let me tell u, this is all the high u need

If you also don’t like that anxious paranoid feeling from smoking most likely you will not get this with HH but I am new to strain and can’t be 100% yet, so far so good!!”"

Barbeecain,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1796757,"“This will be my first review ever. I have to admit, I was a little reticent about purchasing a high cbd strain. I waned to see, what, if anything, cbd would do for me.
 The bud was sooo fragrant! Just pristine. 
I just waned to inhale it's vapor right out of the jar.
upon smoking a warm wave envelops the body, the mind relaxes and stress melts away. It doesn't mess with my head in the way that smoking high thc can.

Amine961,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1467443,"“Got some of this in a vape pen and in capsules from CuraLeaf in Florida! This stuff works wonders for my anxiety, and it allows me to medicate and feel relief before going to University without having to be inebriated by the effects of THC! This has been my first experience with CBD rich cannabis, and it will surely be part of my cannabis routine when I re-introduce THC after my tolerance break is over. Would recomme...”"

I tried HH Red this past Friday and fell asleep and slept the whole night- something I have not done in awhile.  I tried It again last night and woke today feeling good- I felt happy, energized and much better than I can recall in years. It may be that I do well on a high CBD and low THC flower. I vaporized it.  I am very pleased with ...”"

plantacolyte,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/haleighs-hope/reviews/1781535,"“I'm relatively new to cannabis & relied heavily on the advice from the dispensary counselor when I first started using whole flower. HH was on my list of must-try strains because it was formulated to treat some of my conditions-- muscle spasms, seizures, & pain. I remember the counselor being a bit dismissive of the strain, so I didn't get it initially-- and had to wait weeks for the dispensary to have more available...”"
