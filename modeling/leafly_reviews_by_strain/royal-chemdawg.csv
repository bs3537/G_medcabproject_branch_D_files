Firstly, its extremely pungent, I could easily smell it right through the paper bag and ziplock bag it was delivered in.  It has a fruity, skunky, diesel-y stench that is pretty amazing.  The high is extremely relaxing for the body and mind, and is a good pick for enjoying at night time.  I would definitely buy this one again.”"
TheGermiNation,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/royal-chemdawg/reviews/1386866,"“Very pleasant pungent aroma.  Chemical taste hints of fruitiness.  Definite creeper, heavy indica hitter.”"
LiquidxSwords,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/royal-chemdawg/reviews/1386868,"“Very Heavy around the eyes and creates a very heavy feeling throughout the body. This is definitely a couch lock strain so i would only smoke evenings to night. The smoke wasn't harsh much at all and definitely feel very relaxed.”"

It's possible to be mellow, way mellow & awake. Taking on tasks with a breeze and not a worry to be felt for a few hours. Very tasty and powerful. Relaxing but not immobile. Great party starter for sure. A have to try! Enjoy!!!”"

Also completely got rid of my flying jitters or anxiety. About half hour into it, I can not stop smiling. Highly recommend this strain”"

Tommy2Tokes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/royal-chemdawg/reviews/1234660,"“Pick some up at the Evergreen Market produced by Errls Concentrates. Super nice Indica feeling, long lasting flavor seems a bit on the diesel side but very tasty and light. I like the relaxing high.”"
