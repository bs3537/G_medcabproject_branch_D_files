I literally tried to stand up and my legs felt like Jell-O. I'm a new smoker and this was ground up with a plastic grinder and smoke with hemp wick in an average sized Sherlock bubbler. I'm definitely getting more of this, I was really sick from getting very little sleep for the past few days and was...”"

I was having a depressive episode and this beautiful strain cradled me into its arms and carried me to a fluffy bed of clouds. With enough mental clarity to still contemplate life. Lulled me to sleep shortly after.

This was recommended to me over Grand Daddy Purple for its flavor and smell, and I'll have to agree. There's a sweet floral quality to the sharp sour punch that's plea...”"

You really do get to see it's arousal effects so a great one when with your partner (or by yourself tbh) But has given me some of the best body highs i've ever had; it's truly out of this world. I only bought a gram of it from the dispensary that was carrying it around me and now they're sold out so I have the little tiny bit I have left for a special occasion.”"

Vicent.D,https://www.leafly.com/indica/reclining-buddha/reviews/1261400,"“I find this strain to be  very relaxing and uplifting and still leaves you motivated with out couch lock. on inhale you can taste the citrus on exhale I find it to be earthy.  definitely a great body buzz that will relieve the day to day stress.”"
captainjonjon,https://www.leafly.com/indica/reclining-buddha/reviews/1765910,"“This strain gives me the kind of high I’d get back when I first started smoking. 
I love it
I feel like a teenager but In a good way
I can’t wait to try it with my gf this weekend”"
greenxvii,https://www.leafly.com/indica/reclining-buddha/reviews/1392168,"“Absolutely my favorite indica ive tried thus far. I smoked one blunt and flew off into a haze with a deeply relaxed (almost out of body) experience. Then i proceeded to smoke another one which made me feel like i was mid- astral projection.

This strain is extremely potent and would be great for meditation and relaxation while also being an amazing pain reliever. Truly an experience!”"
StonerNo420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/reclining-buddha/reviews/1268151,"“Very hard to get hold of this but this is by far better than any other strain I have ever tried. After 3 hits on the bong I was lost in thought and spent 4 hours looking through Wikipedia without realizing how much time had past. ended up having the best sleep in my life as well. very relaxed and uplifting feeling and very sleepy. If you ever find this strain please get it!”"

Lashalane,https://www.leafly.com/indica/reclining-buddha/reviews/1310947,"“Just tried it tonight after reading all the reviews. Halfway through the bowl and I'm feeling relaxed, mellow and chill. I'm guessing the other half will lock me in if I allow it to, but otherwise I could just glide along like Casper in a nice hazy mist.”"
Bbauer25,https://www.leafly.com/indica/reclining-buddha/reviews/1488566,"“I loved this strain. I have not been smoking for a long time however of all the strains I have tried and my brother (seasoned smoker) this is our favorite. the best way I can describe this high is a light body orgasm covering me head to toe.”"
PandaOG15,https://www.leafly.com/indica/reclining-buddha/reviews/1372072,"“It's very relaxing and good for when you don't want to do much but rest and laugh. It did help a little with my pain and discomfort from being in a motorcycle accident. It tastes nice and sweet. It has a nice smell as well. The smoke is a little thick and drys your mouth out. I'd say a good strain for stress and discomfort. Not full on pain.”"
