BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-plus-20/reviews/1525054,"“A decent indica. Seems almost twice as strong as Critical Plus. Definite woody taste on the exhale. Great pain killer I use it for the pain I get from scoliosis, degenerative disc disease, herniated discs, migraines, and any stomach pain.
If you have trouble getting hungry this strain is a great appetite stimulant.”"

Bart8888,https://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-plus-20/reviews/1744217,"“Nice strain by Dinafem. Very much a Skunk Kush/Big Bud sort of weed so if you have smoked for a few years, you are familiar with the high. I would call this the archetypical high. Indoor indica hydro. Quite relaxing, quite strong. Not overwhelmingly strong. It's your allrounder really. Can't go wrong”"

TheMadStrater,https://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-plus-20/reviews/1435645,"“I prefer Indica dominant hybrids and pure Indica strains but this one doesn't do it for me AT ALL because it makes me very anxious (the anxiety typically lasts about 30-40 min and subsides).  I've consumed this strain on three occasions with the same negative effect so I've decided to drop it from the rotation.  IMHO it is very strong strain even though the THC content tested at 18.9% which isn't super high.  Proves ...”"
