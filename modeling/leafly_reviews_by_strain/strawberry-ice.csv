I like getting organized for the new year, but this was not the high I was looking for. I smoked a bowl of OG Chem to tamp down the intense focus of Strawberry Ice, and it worked like a charm. I was still focused and smart, but the O...”"
Garedicus,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-ice/reviews/1417507,"“I picked up a gram of this by Tropic Grow, on my quest to try out more sativas. The buds were a lovely shade of sage green, with a decent coating of milky resin. After being cracked open, they were filled with an impressive amount of orange hairs. Harvested 6/1/16, this was purchased and consumed on 12/16/16.

The buds had a floral, berry scent that deepened and became musky when ground. The flavor was sweet in the m...”"

Squatchmo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-ice/reviews/1374721,"“Sweet with a minty aftertaste, Strawberry Ice makes me cough without being harsh on the throat (reminiscent of Strawberry Cough) and has a flavor resembling strawberries. I got small popcorn nugs that are dense, light green, and absolutely COVERED in orange hairs. The kief/leaf flakes at the bottom of my jar was predominantly orange. Strawberry Ice leaves me happy and focused, ready to walk the dogs, get some housewo...”"
Zoinkadoo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-ice/reviews/1290023,"“Fresh, she is tasty and fruity. Don't let her dry out though, the perfume fades. Wonderful high, but the buds for me were fast burning, so a bowl went up quickly. Seriously not dense at all so your product seems to run out faster than other strains. Great for off time when you need to unwind and disconnect. Excellent strain for depression and fatigue.”"

maskofbartman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-ice/reviews/1359091,"“First, what im calling 4 stars would probably be 5 for most ppl, given the frequency of 5 star ratings on this app. If I could give it 4.5 I would; this strain convinced me to give MariCann a second chance.

Beautiful smell, taste and nice looking buds w big crystals that stick to the green.

This is a great choice getting stuff done and feeling good while doing it.”"

tluke,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-ice/reviews/1765762,"“This is definitely a five-star strain. Firstly, it actually smells like strawberries and that's cool. Extremely fun high, very giggly and euphoric. I love this before watching some Seinfeld or other comedies. And, doesn't give me the munchies like I see with a lot of other strains! 5/5 would recommend Strawberry Ice!!”"

At it’s peak you can focus and retain what’s going on but not worry. Amped up my hunger quite a bit, lol. Felt at ease and wiped my fatigue away. Then the high rolls out and I felt content.”"
Bayonetworkk,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-ice/reviews/1764799,"“Strawberry Ice has a clean and crisp draw with a very strong and sweet strawberry flavour (my fingers smelled like strawberries this morning still). Burns nice and grey. Great as an all-day smoker and my personal go-to after work strain. Relieves all stress but wont leave you couchlocked. 

STI is a horrible abbreviation for an otherwise great strain. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯”"

CapnBakes,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-ice/reviews/1268571,"“This is the second time I've picked this strain up.  The aroma upon opening was sweet strawberries, grasses and mint. Vaping in the g-pen opens up the flavors, and brings on an uplifting, energetic and social buzz.  
Smoking in a pipe brings on the same effects, although the enjoyable tastes were harder to find.”"

PeaceOut,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/strawberry-ice/reviews/1364668,"“smoked this with a water pipe. Such wonderful flavour and aroma. Exhaling out of the nose reveals the sweet strawberry and the mouth a cream. Almost reminded me of strawberry cream biscuits.
The come on is fairly fast with a very heady high that lasts a while. Relaxing and energizing.
No paranoia, a bit of a cough when you get a big toke in.
Used it with a vape pen but didn't give the wonderful flavours.”"

This 60% Sativa and 40% Indica strain is fresh off the Multiple-Winning Sativa at the DOPE Cup in Oregon.  For a mildly Sativa dominant this sure is one heady strain.  Her parentage is only partially known a Very Blue Blueberry Male crossed with an unknown Female Cann...”"
