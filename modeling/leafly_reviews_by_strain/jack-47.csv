=============
amsterdamyid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-47/reviews/1302699,"“a superb strain of two of the greatest greens put together. smells and taste exceptional like old school smoking, a lovely fruity heavy taste like a good brandy/whiskey. buds are compact with a very heavy coating of crystals”"
pdrchris,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-47/reviews/1382893,"“Jack 47 is seriously amazing. Smells great and tastes great. I have been smoking for a long time and Jack 47 brings me back to the days of uncontrolled laughing fits. Smiles all day long and deep thoughts is what you can expect with this wonderful strain.”"

1989Cadillac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-47/reviews/1672929,"“This tastes really nice smoke.
Skunky with a bit of Thai stick and some Columbian taste too, and yes there is Mexican in this too.

 It is a very smooth toke compared to other strains.But you may cough due to the high THC conent.
The Skunk will either knock you out, or even take you higher to a new level of conciousness

This is good when you want to get really high.
Hands down ripper.
Just have a few puffs.”"
sattla,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-47/reviews/1780153,"“Excellent early midday strain very uplifting. Expect a strong smell from the AK47 but more pleasant due to Jack. I would rely recommend this strain for active ppl.

For me that rely love a good amnesia haze this strain is a good sub if you wanna change it up. 

The energizing effect rely caught me off-guard its from now on up there with my favorite strains for sure.”"

btownbuds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-47/reviews/1292547,"“beautiful smell of grapefruit and pine, with a great uplifting high. Had an awesome head rush without being anxious falling into a great body numbness. at one point I was able to zone out and couldn't feel any of my limbs, bit mental really.”"
bushmeister,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-47/reviews/1447225,"“Certainly among my Top 5 favorite strains, u get a one of a kind high from this one. Hits u like a god damn truck!!!”"
anown,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-47/reviews/1343693,"“A very potent hybrid, which in a proper growing can be tremendous. The batch I got was outdoor and not very well grown and cured. Thick buds with heavy aromas and both sativa and indica effects. Probably very good for medical use. Not one of my favourites for sure. If I get a better quality I will update.”"
nicflo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-47/reviews/1357022,"“this bud smells as beautiful as it looks. great taste great feeling.”"
