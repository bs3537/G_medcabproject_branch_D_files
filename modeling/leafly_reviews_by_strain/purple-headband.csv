NcNugget,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1362451,"“This gave me a very euphoric high, I was mellowed, but still in the mood to be active and do things. It was also straight purple so it was aesthetically pleasing. Very satisfied.”"
FireMarshallBill,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1337963,"“Phenomenal balanced hybrid - I've smoked from same grower in Mendo both years now, both indoor and out. One of my favorite strains. I'm not big into floral aesthetics, but this is a gorgeous specimen with a broad display of many colors. Cerebral sativa, somewhat psychedelic, with mind body buzz.”"
kkcastillo21,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1447109,"“Definitely headband. I feel so relaxed and chill. My anxiety is completely gone and I have a real bad case of the munchies 😂 but this shit is good.”"
SweepKing18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1565588,"“I just smoked a bowl of some very nice Purple Headband flowers, and I am extremely impressed. This strain is totally amazing. The buds are dense & purple with pink and orange hairs. Covered in white crystals (pollen or resin). The aroma is also  very nice. This is a prime example of why I love all of these hybrid strains. I don’t particularly care for the sour diesel flowers by them selves, but when crossed with OG K...”"
Per420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1256473,"“If I had seen the other 2 reviews for this strain I probably wouldn't have tried it. That said, I'm glad that I didn't because my experience was actually pretty good. I think the individual plant and the experience of the grower can make a huge impact on the product (no shit right?). Take that into account when reading the bad reviews. This strain is worth trying.”"

and anxiety!”"
nico3745,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1280781,"“This strain is more energizing on the physical side. Mentally, it is a relaxing and carefree type of high. Potency is medium, although overdoing the strain will give a slight nervous edge (not too bad though). Anyone who does well with Sour Diesel will like this strain. The headband was there when I first starting smoke this a year or so ago, now I don't even feel it. Overall, a good strain. I have bought a few times...”"

Relaxes your brain, but you can still go hiking and go grocery shopping. I highly (get it?) recommend this strain. It’s wonderful.”"
Nutzonswole,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1337848,"“Give this strain a shot. I just tried it. I gotta say, Its a nice smoke. Very good head high, makes you put on that thinking cap and get to it. Overall a nice relaxed and focused high. 10/10 I'd smoke this every night.”"
mossyrock,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1334104,"“A strong positive headband feeling in the frontal lobes. One of my favorites for a traditional cannabis fun, happy high. Uplifting, but grounded feeling. Love the smell too.”"

AkaTeddd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1320188,"“Purple Rubber band is a 50/50 strain. Very euphoric at first then settle's in like your wrapped in blanket very similar to the feeling I get from  Lo drops CBD drops. Great strain if you want to remain pain free during day while accomplishing your Activities of daily living. If not available in your area throw some rubber band flower mixed w/ honey oil purple skunk like a cake or cookie.”"

Galahardt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1337667,"“Amazingly uplifting, an all around great strain, but if you don't have munchies you're in for a bad time.”"
CamEddy_PuebCo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1566270,"“Amazing strain, one of my top 5. I am usually one to choose indica or sativa dominant strains depending on what I'm doing, or what time of day it is. With this strain there is no need to figure that out I can smoke it all day and have a fun giggly High whether I'm doing something active or just melting into the couch. If you come across purple headband I highly recommend it, it is the perfect mix of indica and sativa...”"

llmead,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1501129,"“purple headband honestly made me feel weird. at first my high started off strong; but gradually it turned into more of an anxiety high. however, it does taste good and is probably the most beautiful bud i’ve ever seen.”"

alkemest,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-headband/reviews/1306975,"“It's a really well balanced strain. I like my weed to put me in a couch lock before bed and this definitely does. But you can also smoke it in the day and be perfectly fine. I was even able to work out on it, so it's a keeper for me. 
No anxiety either, just a relaxing head and body high.”"
