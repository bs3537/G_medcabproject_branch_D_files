chris.castro81,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1413257,"“This stuff hits you in under a minute. The smoke itself is very smooth although after you exhale, the coughing is almost inevitable. You’ll start feeling the pressure build behind your nose and the couch-lock comes shortly after. Dam, my arm feels like wooden blocks right now. Now, my legs…I’m like that old man pirate dude with the wooden everything in Family Guy. I’ve noticed my breathing has gotten extremely slow. ...”"
monstapuss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1431178,"“The feeling almost reminds me of gooey.  Was in some good pain earlier & wanted to sleep, but pain kept me awake.  Tried this from Reef (Queen Creek) in crumble, not expecting much. Was very pleasantly surprised! 
Take small hits, I suggest, cuz it's fairly harsh & hits hard!! You feel it instantly, but it still creeps & builds!  On this as I write.
Works better than any painkiller I've been prescribed, stopped all p...”"
dfirth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1207257,"“One of my favorite strains as of late. The smell is of a sweet, strong aroma and the taste mimics this description with its hard-hitting, sweet, milky smoke. The high is a euphoria engrained with deep thoughts and happy times. The high of the perfect length. I highly recommend it.”"
WisconsinCheeseHead,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1361880,"“First time trying Medusa
Form: Shatter 
Thought: very smooth taste on inhale as well as exhale. Upon inhale I had thoughts of childhood memories, the taste just minded me of something from my younger days. Very functional high, as I am writing this review 10 minutes after vaporizing. The feeling after that is strictly lofty and energized, praying for no one to ruin such a good feeling as me and Pabst are on a date. :...”"
strychninecandy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1410672,"“I recently vaped the last of my medusa flowers from my new herbalizer. thc was 19.6%.  the taste was light, exceptionally smooth and minty/herbaceous and mildly earthy.  the high was near instantaneous, energetic with pleasant throbbing concentration around my eyes and temple. 

this is a good choice for times when one wants a non-debilitating but stony high, which for me is often.”"
chase185,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1204546,"“It's above average. I smoked it out of a vapor and it was very euphoric. Then we pulled out the gravity hammer and got really high”"
YourPigeon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1204545,"“First time I smoked this Strain it knocked me on my ass. Later I´ve got more uesed to it and used to smoke it before going to social gatherings, to be relaxed and just to be happy being around ppl.”"
Trevarraw,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1412972,"“Love this bud! To me it taste a lil bit like chocolate but idk I could be tripping. Nice fluffy buds! Has a lotta purple in it most of the time, but sometimes it comes out more green. Still has the same great taste and smell though! If you're going to be coping this bud I'd say go to reef dispensary..”"
wompastompa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1378258,"“Like the name Medusa will literally make you want to close your eyes. Heavily sedated cerebral release, you could center your zen on this one in controlled doses, but  if you enter into Medusa's lair she will turn you to stone for quite a period of time!”"
cccofme,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1285857,"“The 2nd pheno has been grown and dried and is curing. This one was about the same yield as the last a paltry 4+ oz and about 10 weeks in flower. The smell is amazing for this phenotype and my feeling is it will be a nice buzz as well.”"
noodlyappendage,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1172929,"“Very nice smoke. Beautiful nugs with lots of bright orange hairs. One of my favorite sativas.”"

Ryno602,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1172133,"“I was skeptical of this at first but after trying it my pain is reduced and my music is more fun to play. Tastes amazing I even had that diesel a few minutes after smoking”"
mjmarie88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1196745,"“Has a light fruity sweet taste, very pretty buds. Gives ya a pretty instant high, not a creeper. Good balanced high, you can actually get shit done!”"
Hailfor666,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1711951,"“Not my favorite, smoked one joint and made me feel really foggy in the head. You’d think it at least make you giggly, but nope, just foggy and made t really hard to understand things. It also made me extremely tired but impossible to sleep. Can safely say this is my least favorite.”"
brother61,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1721121,"“Excellent Hybrid you get little sleepy, relax, creative, Euphoric and happy. .Great  stain for daytime and night use.”"
theORherb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1571225,"“I enjoyed this hybrid. It has a really nice, sweet citrus aroma. After a few minutes it began to make my body feel relaxed as well as deliver a pleasant head-high. I'd recommend it.”"
racs037,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1530377,"“This is a “heavy” high for me. I can’t handle it lol. If I take too much I go straight to sleep. That’s a good thing if you want to go to sleep though. I like to enjoy my high for at least an hour or two so this isn’t my go-to strain. Overall, recommend for people struggling with insomnia and looking for total relaxation.”"

cccofme,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/medusa/reviews/1280547,"“I really wish that I could rate it higher but it just doesn't stand out to me. I grew the first phenotype out and it took 10 weeks in flower, the bud totally covered in trichomes and a very beautiful plant, it yielded about 5 oz dry just a modest yield. No special taste or smell and not a real special buzz. We thought this would be fabulous but it just isn't. I have a few more phenos and clones to grow out, hopefully...”"

And that's where the similarity ends, because this Medusa is no monster. On the contrary, she's lovely. You'll feel the super stone all right!---but you won't be frozen in time and space. 
And this Medusa, though not at all subtle, will be your friend. Suddenly I'm beginning to sound like Mr. Rogers.
Aroma and taste: Not an OMG, but p...”"

If the focus is only on one task, like in our case here playing darts, it's good. trying to focus while vacuuming, walking through the whole house. .... distractions are everywhere. so choose wisely :)

You get a really functional high from Medusa, great if you want to get creative or medicate before work without getting tired or lazy.

I am not usually prone to migraines, but this saved me with the last one I had - it was so bad I was pulling over on the drive home to throw up.  Smoked some Medusa - within about 30 minutes the migraine was completely gone, and I was able to function and be social at a dinner party instead of canceling.  Strong calming yet uplifting effect for me.”"
