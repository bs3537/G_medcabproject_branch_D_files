HausParty,https://www.leafly.com/indica/shiva-skunk/reviews/1417292,"“Sharp, strong smell on beautiful looking buds. Very smooth, my buddy is normally a big cougher but he didn't have any trouble ripping this. The high was surprisingly clear-headed and alert for an Indica, which I find usually puts me to sleep. We giggled and talked and brainstormed for our D&D game, then I left for a date feeling completely relaxed.

To quote my buddy on this: "I'm fucked up, but I feel like I can s...”"
jessi.chval,https://www.leafly.com/indica/shiva-skunk/reviews/1374660,"“This strain was one of the first ones I ever obtained, and it has always been a favorite. Clean, happy, clearheaded stone with only a little bit of laziness as it wears off. Potent medicine for anxiety and stress. Helpful with pain, but more useful just to help you relax.”"
Cruciatus_Parvulus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/shiva-skunk/reviews/1399159,"“Beautiful buds, nice aroma, smooth and tasty smoke. Struck me as a social herb, not overpowering or too long lasting. A definite "mental health" herb, have the eye drops and a snack handy. Day use ok.”"

RollinDoja216,https://www.leafly.com/indica/shiva-skunk/reviews/1360998,"“A very distinctive, skunky fumey smell that can make your nose hairs dance. Nice controllable high, tingly body rush with a buzz that's heavy yet easy to focus with. Red eyes that are glazed like dunkin donuts and a dry mouth make this one a noticeable high. Pretty good shit.”"

LEQCANNASOINS,https://www.leafly.com/indica/shiva-skunk/reviews/1515422,"“I have just come across of an old strain review from 12 years ago of a Sensi created Indica dominant strain that I know as Shivas Shanti a three way cross between Classic Kush x Afghan x Skunk F1.  She is about 85% Indica to 15% Sativa.   

This very relaxing strain is a really decent pain killing strain that is also very cerebral, euphoric and thought provoking without being an overall sedative strain.   I can highl...”"

I smoked one joint and walked around the city for 10 kms without stopping. I was just ecstatic the whole time. Despite the effects listed here I never got hungry and when I arrived at home I felt like I could have walked another 10. 

Definitely one of my favorites.”"

I was always more interested in strains that are Sativa dominant and make me more active than lazy. I smoked this one after going home from a minor party and I was riding my bicycle. I smoked the whole pure joint without a break and enjoyed it without hurting my lungs. After five minutes already I could see the colours aro...”"
