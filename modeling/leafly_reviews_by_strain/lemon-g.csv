I had not tried this strain yet and wanted to try it. Took a couple of hits and noticed a nice calm cerebral high. I noticed a nice relaxation also. This strain is not racy or too buzzy for me. I really like this strain, it has a nice lemony taste.”"
photogofficial,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-g/reviews/1535320,"“Loved this strain. Received it from a friend to try. I fell in love with the taste of this.

I love the energy and clear headed high. I now have a bunch of kief, so I'm trying to figure out the THC percentage, as I intend to make edibles with it (my favorite route of administration). I think the lemon fruity pebble-like scent and zesty taste will pair perfectly with lemon bars or even pound cake!”"

Excellent for pain and mood though it does make you a little more stoned than i’d expected based on the reviews.

WestAmericans,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-g/reviews/1138992,"“Well, it was definitely a head/cerebral effect. It had hazy in spades.
