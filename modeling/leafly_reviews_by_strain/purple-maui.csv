Cs40,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-maui/reviews/1382470,"“Definitely fights the sleepiness of some of my indicas and helps with my anxiety, depression, and stomach problems. Not my first choice for the muscle spasms and pain.  Good to wake and bake in moderation. 

Overall I'd buy it again to treat my daily symptoms! But if my back is really bad I might look elsewhere.”"

Though I have a crazy high tolerance so if the flower is less than 25% thc i don't even notice I smoked at all except to say I'm not nauseous all the Time. Med marijuana patient here.  NH”"
