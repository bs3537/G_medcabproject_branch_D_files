I am very picky and kept puffing it down until the girlfriend snagged it from my resiny lips.  Again, my strain was grown well so it taste nice before lighting up and even better afterwards.  I am impressed and would like to sample it again from different places to really compare the grows.  I read the other reviews and my guess is that...”"

mbgtef,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tiger-woods/reviews/1443841,"“Pretty nice strain. Has a really vibrant "fresh out of the pack" sweet smell to it. Doesn't get you wild high. It def produces a really nice, relaxed, giggly, "easy to zone out" kind of buzz. Would def recommend this to someone needin a slight pick-up but also in search of the giggles. Can def have you overthinkin things if not careful as the high creeps up after 15/20 minutes.”"
