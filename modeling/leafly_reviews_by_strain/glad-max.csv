Glad Max

budsimple,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1210837,"“I am a super fan of Mother's Helper.  I kinda went long on the strain and switched to Moby Dick which is good but it's not Mother's Helper.  Anyway, I didn't think there could be another strain that could trump Mother's helper.

Glad Max is that strain.  

Glad Max is almost a back-cross since Chocolope is crossed with Northern Light's #5 to make MH and Glad Max is Mother's Helper crossed with Chocolope again!  I am ...”"

Psych,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1184753,"“Glad Max is one of my favorite hybrids. The sativa dominance gives you that uplifted, euphoric and creative state of mind with the indica balancing out the high Witt focus and longevity.  I enjoyed an emotional weightlessness and very happy energetic high that lasted longer than some of my favorite sativa. Pretty on the outside with a deeper green and large dark orange to brown hairs this strain is pretty on the insi...”"
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1272617,"“Really like this strain.  Smoke enough of it and you'll feel like your on another planet and yet you can function perfectly well.  You have to hand it to breeders. They come up with amazing strains and this is one of them. I've never had anything quite like it as it has a sharp focus.....and you're super, super high.  Fun to walk around, as you have that light, floaty feeling.  Energizing as well.  I tried it after w...”"
MinusSane,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1193152,"“When I tried this, I had previously tried the Jack Herrer, which is light and bubbly. I found Glad Max to be as amazing as Jack Herrer. It just made me feel better...mentally, physically, emotionally...Everything felt better. I had no "heady" high, I was in a better mood, and happier than I had been in weeks. I recommend this strain if you want the relaxation, euphoria, and calm without the "heady" effects...There wa...”"

I felt it was more sativa dominant with creeper indica onset later... I would have gave it a better star rating but i tend to like more frosty and fertilizer smelling flowers but a very potent strain...”"

tfa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1224731,"“Not impressed, almost reminds me of some top shelf regs. I just smoked for pre-roll after eating my usual daily brownie. Normally with other strains, I feel the full of fact I'm looking for. It is almost like the Glad Max counteracted DFX of my brownie. I've also smoked just a regular bowl of the strain before directly from Monarch once again seemed like a top-notch reg.”"
STPhx420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1206814,"“I must say, out of almost all the marijuana I've ever had, very few have made me as happy as Glad Max did. I tried it a few months ago from Monarch in Arizona. I felt almost instantly happy within 5 minutes of smoking and so did my friend. Both of us agreed that this certainly gave a unique head high in comparison to many others we've tried. I can best describe it as like a clean uplifting feeling.”"
earthandtone,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1219830,"“Its not the most potent strain but dont let that fool you. Its euphoric. Its more euphoric then strains with allot more thc. Monarch has a really good concentrate honeycomb of gladmax which is extremely potent and amazing.”"
uniqueid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1239326,"“The best hybrid I have tried so far. Very indica-like in effect with just the right touch of sativa. If you like Purple Berry, you will probably like this strain.”"

It has also given me the best clear headed energetic high that I can even sleep on if I want!

minimalist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1176804,"“Good, but definitely not as good as Mother's Helper. I felt a touch of anxiousness and paranoia which I don't with Mother's Helper.”"

Can imagine it would be awesome, multi-purpose, bone deep relief and longer-lasting as a medible. Won't know until someone does it??? Hint? Bake with it? Please? lolol”"

Monarch was excellent to work with and very informative!”"
atenesser,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1266109,"“Wow. Just wow. A nice hint of limonene in this otherwise spicy strain.

I felt atop Goku's Flying Nimbus after inhaling just a small dose of this potent, flavorful, and favorably harsh smoke. IT was a nice lemon cough drop type of choke that left you stress-free and ready to take on the day upon peaking.”"
softailcarrie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1220032,"“Glad Max is damn good medicine, budget-priced at Monarch. Falls right behind Mother's Helper, at much less cost. It's good for medication as well as jubilation; it is more multi-purpose than Northern Lights, Blueberry or Willie's Wonder by providing pleasant cerebral and body effects, both.  :-D Love Monarch but wish my discount applied to the $35 an eighth bud, especially when Monarch is quite a drive.

Doublepinkeye,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glad-max/reviews/1187939,"“Danky for sure. A good head buzz that came with manageable paranoia. I liked the feeling of this hybrid. I was totally able to function and forgot about my neck pain for a while...so there's that. I feel like the leafly description of this herb was pretty spot on. 7/10 but given the right atmosphere, could easily be a 9/10.”"

I love it.  Has that sweet angelic baby poop smell, but more sweet and less funky.  The best weed always smells like cherub diarrhea.  After 2 hits I was in love, taste very sweet,  kind of like caramel, which can be detected in the sweetness of the smell after tasting it. will definite...”"
