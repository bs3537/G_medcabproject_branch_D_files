I have a Pax 1 pocket vape unit, and looks like a cell phone from 20 feet away.  This is my first Indica after testing a dozen different Sativas over the last 6 months. I got this at a dispensary in Bend Oregon, called Oregrown.   I asked the budtender for his recommendation for a good migraine relief strain.  W...”"
malia510,https://www.leafly.com/indica/3x-crazy/reviews/1418690,"“I like this strain a lot.  It has beautiful dark purple and green buds with orange hairs.  With just a few hits you get a clear headed, cerebral type high, nothing too intense.  You can function fine, be out in public.  When smoked in greater amounts, (for me about 7-10 hits) you get a strong heavy body high.  Very relaxing and good for pain.”"
jabbathepot,https://www.leafly.com/indica/3x-crazy/reviews/1418691,"“I said to the bud tender, "Give me the couch lockiest thing you have." She whipped out the 3X Crazy. This stuff is strong. I actually got a little sick vaping it, and was ready to write it off as a mistake, but the nausea passed after a few minutes and was followed by such heavy relaxation and sedation I couldn't be bothered to even move my mouth to speak. My restless leg syndrome didn't stand a chance. I fell asleep...”"

allgovernmentsLIE,https://www.leafly.com/indica/3x-crazy/reviews/1377137,"“The color is a very deep purple with dramatic orange hairs. Under the microscope, it looks like bondage weed made from black leather and studs. It even seems like there are 3 times as many trichromes as I'm used to seeing on meds! Well-matured crystals; mostly clear bulbous heads with several frosted heads resembling granulated sugar.

When I first saw it, I was really stoked because it looks AWESOME, with deep purple coloration and nice trichromes. I looked into it more before smoking it. 3X Crazy is its name due to being a cross 3x with indica strains.

Had it during a music improv and it was the best day of my life hands down. All the laughing, food, music, and friends were at level 10. This strain has taken the crown from Sunset Sherbet by a margin in my opinion. There’re both extremely similar in effects and strength. You can’t go wrong with either.”"

Its a perfect indica Imo. Starts at the top and works its way down in a smooth way. The flavor is what u would expect from the genetics. I went easy on it, just wanted a nice head/body change and it deff was a NOICE!!!”"

I was up and about looking for was to feed the hunger that came over me about an hour later. A beverage is needed for sure (smoothie recommended) when enjoying this bud.”"

Kye,https://www.leafly.com/indica/3x-crazy/reviews/1300658,"“Anxiety? What anxiety? I live with social and general anxiety. This strain makes me relaxed but not couch locked. I can smoke it in the daytime wile still being able to function properly.

I normally don't like strains with OG Kush because it makes me hyper-focused but with the combination of Granddaddy Purple and Bubba Kush I don't experience any negative effects. 

When I smoke it at night my body is relaxed enough...”"
