I would write more, but indica out”"
BudskiesHq,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hashbar-og/reviews/1429456,"“Hashbar OG is not only a really potent strain, but has won multiple cannabis cups previously. I really like the euphoria and the creativeness that I get while medicating with HashBar OG. I would not only recommend this strain to indica lovers but hybrid and sativa consumers as well.”"

WAkierstin,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hashbar-og/reviews/1554009,"“This definitely knocked me out. Which is what I use it for. The only thing really keeping me awake was the dry mouth and how much I had to pee because of all the water I drank.”"

stylecore,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hashbar-og/reviews/1629388,"“I was looking for something to help with insomnia, anxiety, and had painkilling properties, and this seems to fit the bill. The physical effects are pronounced - I can feel it behind my eyes and throughout my body, while remaining 100% lucid and clear-headed. It feels like being wrapped up in a warm blanket and having someone whispering to you that everything will be a-ok. It helps me fall asleep but doesn’t keep me ...”"

BudskiesHq,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hashbar-og/reviews/1429421,"“In the old days of clandestine growing, people found many strains to be unsuitable for stealthy indoor grows.

Kavinzky,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hashbar-og/reviews/1585414,"“Clear and focused buzz. Very smooth, probably the smoothest I’ve ever smoked.”"
MoesNugz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hashbar-og/reviews/1566337,"“Incredibly strong body high definitely keeps me up but on the couch. Highly recommend for people with anxiety or nausea. It’s amazing in a Russian Cream Backwood!”"

It's definitely make my feel chilled out and relaxed, focused (clearly because I'm actually using punctuation for once :P) I'm feeling good peeps! I'm thinking i'll finally fall asleep soon. I'm picturing smoking this durgin the a nice summer night just chilling by the fire with my friends. I'm about it!
