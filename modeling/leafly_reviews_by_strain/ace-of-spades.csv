After those bong rips I finished some work I was putting off until the morning & got some writing done. Relaxed my back while I sat at my desk writing this, writing my book  and doing my work. When I got up after 3 hours with little to no back pain & was ready for bed. Nice sound sleep. Excellent color, aroma,& taste...”"

It makes a very nice hybrid giving a slow coming indica body high but also giving a sense of energy. If you don't take advantage of the energy while its there then couch lock will likely set in. Strong meds and one that I like to use for my back pain.”"

The smell was great. Very herbal and sweet, almost reminded me of Jager. 

The taste was excellent. Right of the inhale it fills your taste buds with herbal sweetness! The exhale was very Mellow, sweet and smooth. Didn't have a single cough.

Now to the stone. Very behind the eyes and back of the skull feel...”"

Lots of stems and water leaves (The little leaves that fall off right before it's time to harvest) Which means this plant was harvested too early, not cured properly either. It was very earthy, which can be a good thing sometimes, but it was not so in this case.

Effects came on slowly for me but were very noticeable and provided excellent pain, nausea anxiety and depression relief.  I didn't get hungry, but stomach was calmed.  I would purchase again.”"

A strong Sativa high kicks in immediately with the first bong rip. It's focused, energetic, at the same time it's relaxing. The Indica component provides a good body stone to go along with the head high. Only downside: the relaxing component can turn into sleepiness, that depends on how much...”"

This strain is very strong and has amazing effects it helps with sleep pain and is a great mood booster This is the perfect strain when chilling with friends.

Light green STRAIGHT CAKED in trichs and covered in these short dark orange hairs. The smell was appealing kind of lemony and earthy. The earthiness comes through in the exhale and stays as an aftertaste. The high is very strong. It starts as an almost racy Sativa high than mellows out to a nice body stone later. Medicinally I would say its...”"

Colors of deep blue and purples, bright green and red hairs make this bud unique and exotic, out of this world. Great taste, with hints of berry and fruit with a little citrus mixed in.
