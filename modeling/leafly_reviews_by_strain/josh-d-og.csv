After doing 2 dabs I decided I wanted to take a bubble bath and for some reason played with some of my old star wars toys. I just turned 29 today & I'm female I don't play with toys in the tub. On this strain I do.
Definite couch lock sedation when over indulged, has a sweet & almost chemical taste. 
I suffer from some pre...”"

Brand: Canamo
THC: 71%
This strain is a great relaxing indica. It does provide you with that stoney couch lock feeling. Now if you're looking for a strain to give you energy this is not it.
The parents of this strain give hint to it's potency. Triangle Kush, SFV OG, and hell's angel all on their own provide amazing indica effects so combined they're even better.
Make sure you have plenty of food before ...”"

I grew it along side my winner strains i thought I was wasting my time growing this strain but boy i was wrong it turns out it was the strongest indica in my collection way stronger then my GDP 
it took 12 weeks to finish chopped down @ 10% amber and 90% milky trichomes for the first 8 weeks this strain had no smell to it

I find it very relaxing, great for insomnia!
I grew this strain (attitude seeds), this plant is a beast.  It outgrew every other strain.  FAST!   This a nice body stone, no so much head, but I like that when I want to sleep.

Will definitely grow again.

Fuck I'm ripped...

I had 4 strains next to it, I trashed the 12 Josh D OG, first time i ever do that. I never had a plant die on me. Believe me, this is straight trash. I understand better why this strain is 1 or 2yo, a hype name, and still no report on her / no hype around her. It's cause it's one of the worst strain you...”"

trumids,https://www.leafly.com/indica/josh-d-og/reviews/1519901,"“Bought this from a dispensary, as it was the only strain on the shelf with any aroma. A light lemon og scent, but the taste is not OG or lemon at all.   Onion garlic + blueberry + blue cheese. Really poor effects from this one.  Barely feels like weed.  Looks like somone else feels the same. 

Horrible strain if the "dispensary version" is anything to judge by”"
