hollistar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/animal-cookies/reviews/1417659,"‚ÄúI have really bad cramps being a girl, it feels like my insides are twisting. If you're a girl you may be going through this too, regular over the counter pain medicine doesn't help me. This knock out my pain after the first two hits, it kind of sends your body off and makes it feel as if you're floating. This strain makes your body feel tingly and light. I would definitely use this strain for anything pain related.‚Äù"
DrDrea,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/animal-cookies/reviews/1417657,"‚ÄúWhile GSC is still my preference, after spending an afternoon indulging in this strain to a point of near tweaking, I have to say it was very enjoyable.

So far, I'm liking this one quite a bit.  I've tried Thin Mint Cookies before, which I very much enjoyed, so I was excited to try this one.  I am not disappointed!

I found this made cleaning my house much more enjoyable.  But I do notice that if I'm a bit tired, or if I relax to watch a movie or TV show, it's likely that I'...‚Äù"
