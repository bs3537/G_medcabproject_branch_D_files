hoobear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1389534,"“I smoked this great plant recently...at a concert...and it surpassed all expectations. The euphoria was clear and persistent. Everything seemed hilarious and we were all the greatest comedians on earth. We ended up smoking this with fellow MJ lovers after the show and they were all amazed by the effects. Talkative, happy and all-around just great time. Definitely try this if you have the chance. I assure you that you...”"
LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1385372,"“Jesus is definitely the right name for this strain, it's a super potent Hybrid and a very potent smoke. As soon as you exhale and feel it's effects you'll understand why it's named Jesus. I can smoke this strain day or night and it helps alot with headaches, spams, anxiety and depression. Definitely a "top shelf" strain and definitely worth a try as this strain will not let you down!”"
74Tiger,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1346704,"“I really like this new version of Jesus by Solstice for a few reasons... 
First is the huge, dense colas frosty with tricomes, so this plant was well cared for and it shows!

Second, I love the aroma; the cured bud is spicy with notes of Vanilla, but when you smoke it, the smell changes to mildly nutty and pine.

Third the high is very mild, mellow, relaxing with no "paranoia" or anxiety.  It is 60%  Indica and a bit...”"
NOTN,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1346703,"“I would describe the feeling Jesus provides as cool, calm, and collected. Despite the relatively high THC content, Jesus was not too heavy. I felt relaxed and mellow and would recommend this strain for easing anxiety and for pain relief.”"
bigdaddyjoeleo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1428040,"“I loved this strain. Almost immediately upon the first exhale, my back and leg pain vanished. It was also a little bit trippy and it played some games with my mind, but in a good way. It relaxed me and took away all of my ailments. The sleep I had while I was on this was fantastic too. Great strain and a great experience.”"
rizl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1195600,"“I vaped some of this around Halloween 2014. I took the dog out for a walk in the dark and misty night and started getting a little tripped out at the window decorations and spookiness. It's a bit too cerebral for me outside of a controlled environment but fun at home. I love Solstice's products. This is no exception. I might not buy it again but would recommend to others who like a heady trip.”"
LaurasWorld420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1572693,"“I found JESUS here waiting for the growers to be hooked up w/ JESUS OG-together they can be proud parents of a new hybrid stain called "Bigger than Jesus OG" or "2nd Coming of Jesus".
 I Love Jesus +Jesus OG would love to meet their offspring if /when the growers can hook them up for new Hybrid creation.”"
Earthchild,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1265040,"“feel nice and happy. juice taste like wine, and cheese it's taste like a good grilled cheese. strain is solid 4.5, extra points though for their price point and minimizing their environmental impact. feel about as happy as I did watching the Sounders score in stoppage time.”"

dabbingmcdabberson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1375069,"“I really enjoyed this strain, enough to where I had to go right back out and buy more before I can't find it. mine is in concentrate form, wax / budder made by refine seattle. the taste is very floral with some lemon and citrus. I can tell the thc amount is high. nice head high, very euphoric that's probably what stands out the most along with the great taste. U can never go wrong with refine seattle.”"
sergio896,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1379999,"“When people tell me I need Jesús in my life I smoke some of this. Best high I've had in a whiiiiile”"

nmsd921,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1368013,"“A great sativa, extremely cerebral and intense lasting effect. I however dont believe this strain was created by Solstice although i am sure they have been dialing it in quite well.”"
marciamello,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1473253,"“I see why they call this strain Jesus. I took One hit and the first thing outta my mouth was, "Jesus!" automatically. Two hits and I was blottoed. Fast acting.”"
DayTripper7711,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1216546,"“I really enjoy the effects of this strain as it provides relaxation and stress relief without causing sedation. It's an uplifting strain that helps fight the blues! Solstice's amazing 5* Bubble Hash has been great for daytime dabbing.”"

bpc1174,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1370420,"“Very euphoric and loaded with THC, definitely more on the Sativa side.”"
Jamiallover,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1498296,"“For me, this strain is a nice Indica heavy buzz. I smoked it at the end of the night, and was already in the mood to chill. The buzz is a nice relaxing body buzz and your mind just kind of wants to puddle some. I really like this for a relaxing movie night strain.”"
kanna37,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1270092,"“Wonderful hybrid.  It works for pain and mood as effortlessly as black magic, and even more for insomnia.  Nice, lemony scent and mild smoke are definite perks, as well.  It also doesn't aggravate my anxiety disorder, simply relaxing me slowly but surely until I feel pleasantly calm and content.  Anyone that gets a chance to try this strain really should take it - I very much doubt there will be many people that will...”"
stoneddragoness,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1279797,"“Really great. I love when I can get my hands onto it. I've only tried one other strain by Solstice and it was good, but Jesus is the best. I try to get it when I find it in stock.”"

Dapperdan206,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1255296,"“I bought this from Paper and Leaf on Bainbridge its a very good value as its price is inexpensive but the potency is still very good. A good mellow high no paranoia. Perfect for chilling outside with friends bbq lawn games etc.”"

gabsworth,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1586651,"“this is my favorite and I am usually an indica only type of smoker.

Arizontnightmare,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1710008,"“I do like this strain a lot! Upon smoking it you feel relaxed. A little euphoric. Be careful standing up because you may feel dizzy! After you calm down, your happy and relaxed! My husband and I went shopping at Ross and it was a lot of fun. Everything seems vivid, and fun. It also keeps you calm. My husband snapped at me on the way home, and I honestly didn’t even wanna fight! I was just happy and chill about it. Wh...”"

TheVioletHour,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1383534,"“I've been dealing with a depressive episode for the last month. After smoking Jesus, I could not stop smiling. It's not super giggly or euphoric so I wouldn't call it upbeat. It just puts you in a good mood, anxieties lessen and you feel like being productive. Minimal munchies and a little bit chatty.

The strain i got is made by Kiana. The leaves were pretty loose but it was only $10 a gram. Great strain for what yo...”"

LilBrownRabbit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jesus/reviews/1524130,"“One of my earliest smokes, super smooth inhale, thick and liquid smoke on the exhale. Nice smell, and a serious creeper. Took 10-15 minutes to take effect, starting with tingly skin and limbs. Then WHAM, hits you like a sledgehammer with trippy visuals, lots of big laughter, everything was hilarious. The indica side follows with waves of chill, and a nice calm. You’re gonna want to have some nice music to listen to; ...”"
