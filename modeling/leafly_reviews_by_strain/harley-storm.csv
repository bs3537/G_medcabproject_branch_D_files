It's got a nice taste , hard to exactly pinpoint the flavor , I have Fibromyalgia, and if I've got some pain that I can't shake, I do some Harley's Storm dabs and pain relief sets in . 

I've found that it pairs well with Tangie or Jilly dabs . Very uplifting , and great medicine !   

In my opinion .... you can't go wrong with CannaVative! 😊✌🏽️”"

Goes to work well and even gives a nice mellow "all is well" high, but doesn't induce paranoia or the other negatives I get from a higher THC level.  I'd have to say this is my new fave CBD strain but it doesn't seem to be very common in CA.  Oh well, another excuse to visit the BLC.”"
