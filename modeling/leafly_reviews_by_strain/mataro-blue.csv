amilano420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mataro-blue/reviews/1372761,"“Fruity taste with a high that creeps on you and will leave you slumped and relaxed. Very dense nugs from the dispensary in Toronto.”"
bk709,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mataro-blue/reviews/1367067,"“I'm unsure of the genetics. My shatter packaging has different ones listed than leafly - and though I tend to agree with leafly, it doesn't matter because this strain is awesome. It tastes of sweet citrus and a slightly kushy finish.

the sativa components hit immediately and gradually fade away to the tingle in your legs and the weight of your eyes. its a very relaxing strain for any time of day, however I prefer it...”"

And Ive tried many strains from Cali, Seattle, Portland, Reno, Denver, and Maine.  It smells sweet and delicious!!.  She looks pretty too with big red hairs and white crystals everywhere.  Its tastes smoothe and very good as well.”"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mataro-blue/reviews/1370374,"“Mataro Blue is a strain that provides very good pain and stress relief. Within an hour after consuming this strain will result in a very calm, relaxed and sleepy feeling. Overall, a good strain to relieve pain, reduce stress and combat insomnia. Would definitely recommend.”"

CanadianBudBoy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mataro-blue/reviews/1383737,"“Mataro Blue has hints of berry when you fist smell the bud. Smokes very nicely, with an effect of relaxation and tingling in parts of the body. Great afternoon and nightime medicine. My cut ranges from an estimated 19-21% THC. Remember to keep some snacks on hand!”"
Hippy_Music,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mataro-blue/reviews/1597174,"“Tbh this is probably more of a 4star strain, but I have to give it a 3 simply because it is hugly overrated. Often labeled backwards as “Blue Mataro” in dispensaries, this strain is often hyped for being super rare (yet I’ve been seeing it everywhere for years) and really potent. Although the flower looks textbook, there’s nothing special about it or the high.”"
Djfuche,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mataro-blue/reviews/1715771,"“Got this strain to help me sleep a lil better and it’s done it’s job. Some of the best sleep I’ve had in a while. Much needed after a crazy work week. With its sweet berry taste this strain is a must try. I got it from www.chronickkushco.ca one of the top indicas for sure.”"
ganjagoddess23,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mataro-blue/reviews/1606099,"“me and some of my friends were feeling blah bc we were out of weed the last few days, I brought over some of this stuff and instantly everyone who was smoking was so smiley and happy and relaxed. it was a great strain, long-lasting high that goes up and down.”"
lagoose,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mataro-blue/reviews/1544817,"“Blue mataro is a terpenes explosion. Super sweet, lowkey vanilla & blueberry taste. The terpenes almost create somewhat of a cooling/numbing effect, especially through vaporization. Awesome genetic crossover, the flavour profile is excentric.”"

Rezmahmuzik,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mataro-blue/reviews/1711479,"“One of the best I’ve smoked. Fruity taste and a really smooth smoke. Thc % was like 21-25%. Left me couch locked for like 3 hrs, and the high hits you instantly. Definitely recommend it to those with bad anxiety or sleeping problems. It’s definitely meant for night time use.”"

Bosko1977,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mataro-blue/reviews/1658208,"“I'm a new smoker as im from the UK.  Living here in Canada and not smoking is like going to Italy and never tasting Lasagne or pizza. I don't get high everyday...until now. 

This strain suits me so well. I'm working more efficiently as  it's silencing all my negativity and self doubt; I'm currently flying through my workload as a result. I generally feel happier,it's not a strong head high no matter how often I smok...”"

RustysReviews,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mataro-blue/reviews/1647765,"“One of my absolute favorites. I suffer from bad depression and anxiety after a head injury and this strain relaxes me which is the indica effect and at the same time is an instant antidepressant for me. I can feel down and smoke Mataro Blue and feel happy again in an instant. Also is light and easy to vape on my Vilcano. I make a beeline for this brand when I see it! A good daytime happy pill !!!”"
