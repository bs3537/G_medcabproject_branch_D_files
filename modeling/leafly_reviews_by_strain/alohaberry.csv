I feel energized but a calm energized, I am ready to handle any task and I can imagine playing sports, going to school, exercising, or anything I else I feel like setting my mind to. I feel very happy and satisfied with how everything is, an "accepting" feeling is how I would put it. A very ener...”"

I think people should be their own judges of quality in the things they purchase. This product just recently became available locally and I decided to research its benefits on the web. Having seen positive results from many prior buyers I went ahead and made the investment. This may have been one of the soundest choices I have made in my adult life. I have fo...”"

gurren_lynx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alohaberry/reviews/1061517,"“Very tasty! I recommend vaping because it eases you into the high better. I felt energetic, yet relaxed and focused with an overall peaceful feeling. The best word to describe the Alohaberry effect is "pleasant."”"

Strong earthy bled with a hint of tropical fruity. It's a good one. I personally am not too into fruit tasting strains but this is earthy enough to make me happy. The high lasts a while and is pretty damn good. Definite hybrid, feeling effects of indica and sativa alike. This strain I've tripped on hard, as w...”"

Connorjl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/alohaberry/reviews/1061513,"“The aloha berry is full of all colors has a very pungent smell and very rich sweet full taste and has a hell of a high I assume it is a hybrid because of the color and the intensity of the high is all encompassing body and mind very relaxing and euphoric I would go as far to say that it's a trippy strain. But with a much better indica balance then LSD Kush.”"

My mind is blown, I feel the way I felt 20 years ago, going into 5th hour after blazing in the park at lunch. 2 dabs and I am so stoned. Very relaxed, euphoric, and happy, but able to focus if I need to. After the 3rd dab, really only able to focus on stuffing my face, in between giggles. I don't remember ...”"
