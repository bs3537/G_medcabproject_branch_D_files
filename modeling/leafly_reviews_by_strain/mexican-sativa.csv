It was dirt cheap and good and lasted a long time. As the season wore on, it got crappy and seedy and then it would dry up, then in Oct, it would start all over again. It gets you pretty ripped, and if you've been on other strains and come back t...”"

Obviously they don't know how to grow sinsemilla. These fine Mexican sativas, if grown right, produce a very nice euphoric high that can last for hours.”"

This is more or less the same shit that was commonly found 25 years ago that everyone around me was smoking- super dense buds, seeds, brownish, and well, not very dank. Two solid bong hits to feel it, 4-5 to catch a reasonable high. "Mids" is an accurate description. 

It starts off with a foggy high and a bit anxi...”"

First time I smoked it I was doing yardwork and had been pufffing durban poison  all day, no probs you know.  Took two big bong rips of the mexican sat and literally had to just sit down and call it a day. Def not functional pot for me, hah.

But...grow those seeds and you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality. Stealthy low odor, hardy vigor, and strong Buzz. You would be wise to save these seeds for growing at a later date, possibly when legal nationwide. I've popped seeds from 7 years ago, and they still produce.”"

Luckily now it's hard to find, so I stick to high grade chronic. Compared to most sativa this strain really gives you the munchies.

scarecrow316,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mexican-sativa/reviews/1380944,"“It varies from time to time but mostly is good. since it's a little bit on the cheaper side you don't expect it to be as potent. some that I have got hit me like a good OG Kush or fire Kush. it is always worth a shot as long as it's in flower form not brick.”"
