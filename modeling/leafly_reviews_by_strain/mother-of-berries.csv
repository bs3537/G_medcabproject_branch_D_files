Nice to try a New England favorite.  For me it's a pretty decent indica for mood, pain, nausea and sleep.  I have a problem with the blueberry aftertaste.  Those of you with stomach issues might get what I mean but easy to take care of.”"

forest berry than just blueberry, and I can only smoke a few bowls before I fall asleep.”"

I got a strong, yet pleasant, berry flavor up front and the rest of the profile eases in after on the exhale.
