glamourgamer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1380763,"“Vaporized in a Da Buddha at the 1:00 position 

This is an absolutely delicious tasting weed! The scent is a strongly pleasant blueberry  scent. The flavor is light with a hint of vanilla. 

This is a great strain for stress, depression, body aches and discomfort, PTSD and for putting a stop to a grumpy attitude! 

I will absolutely seek this one out again and suggest you try it if you have the chance. :)”"
DHerson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1380760,"“This is the strain I prefer to all others for treating my PTSD.”"
PANfugginTERA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1390234,"“One of my favs!  Perfect for staying in your pajamas.  We put ours in blueberry blunt wraps for super smiles”"
Agent907,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1366484,"“Another tasty strain I've recently discovered at Lake Effect Dispensary in Portage,MI. I like the dense buds and the slow burn when smoking with bowl. The buzz is really good, not very heavy. I felt the effects head to toe. Need to smoke a nice fat joint of it than I'll know fo sho!!!”"
monstapuss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1380788,"“Although I haven't tried it myself, giving 5 stars based on a great friend's feedback. He's a flower smoker of 20+ years, who said it was by far "the best smoke he's ever had!!" Helped him with chronic pain, anxiety, PTSD, et cetera, without any couchlock!! His wife even asked him to smoke it indoors (a non-smoker of any type), because it made the house actually smell like blueberry pancakes!! 😂👌

If you come acros...”"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1380764,"“Blueberry Pancakes is a very nice mellow strain. The batch I purchased is a nice balance of indica/sativa. It provided reasonably good pain relief and a nice uplifted, relaxed feeling. Even though the bud was almost 26% THC, it was a fairly mild strain and did not cause any anxiety. Overall a good strain and I enjoyed consuming it.”"
darak420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1380761,"“One of the strongest tasting strains ever  strong taste of pancakes and a lovely High to go with it . Great day time indica”"

nhugh90,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1380765,"“this is an excellent strain for sleep, didn't get the same super happy and hungry effect as other indicas  I've tried for sleep. was just really mellow and polite feeling. I was ready for bed I'm about 15 minutes, the stuff is potent though so be careful.”"
JessicaSOHAI,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1380762,"“Literally tastes like blueberry pancakes. A perfect indica for a lazy, slow morning.”"
tilldeathfitness93,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1366485,"“Just lit up bowl number two in a row of her. She hits, initially, a little harsher than I pictured she would (almost like a sour diesel pull from a pipe) but if you're not a fan of that, nevermind because she finishes smooth, rich and flavorful on the exhale. Immediate flavors noted were vblueberry, vanilla, buttery/doughy, earthy sour but that could just be because I'm lazy and use butane lighters like everyone else...”"
bluevpfree,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1319269,"“Calming, mellow indica that actually does taste like blueberry pancakes when vaping. The bag smelled sweet too, but with a skunky, earthy undertone. Blueberry Pancakes and Blue Cheese are the most delicious tasting strains I've tried. BP has a good body and head buzz, but nothing particularly strong or remarkable about the high.”"
gummibear,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1565487,"“Blueberry Pancaked supplied by ReUp. Beautiful shimmery nugs, a really nice example of this strain. Smells amazing. Very sweet, much like blueberry muffins or pancakes. Lots of crystals on the piece I got. Fuzzy Stoney high. I can feel my tension easing and my body relaxing. I feel chill and less irritated. Very go with flow. I also struggle with generalized anxiety and this does help me feel a little less on edge. I...”"
Chuckchill,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1366489,"“Instant favorite! The scent of this strain is amazing!!! Went on a trip to Seattle and the budtender recommended this gem! I sat with my face nose deep in the bag for 10 min just inhaling that glorious aroma!!! Almost didnt want to smoke it, Almost! The high was just as sweet and amazing as the smell! Went back to that dispensary 2 more times that trip just for this strain. Definite 5 stars!!!”"

bonghitslikedragons,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1480224,"“The buds I bought of BP were more dry and didn't hold a lot of flavor. The high is good for those wanting an indica that doesn't have a heavy body buzz so you can relax or work on some minor tasks. Not my newest favorite, but still glad I tried it.”"
PhilipDeFranco,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blueberry-pancakes/reviews/1689445,"“The Washington strain by Nebula is DJ short blueberry x Oasis cross. the high is a light body high with full head and body pain relief, also a feeling of content”"

I suffer from severe Crohns disease and have been battling a flare the last couple of weeks so I was on the hunt for something to take the edge off the stomach pain and nausea.

The anxiety relief is immediate and it doesn't make you overwhelmingly tired. In fact, it puts me in such a good mood I feel slightly more creative and motivated to do activities... such as, write this review. If you're in Spokane, WA I recommend getting your hands on a Harmony vape pen cartridge in B. Pancakes from Satori North. If you buy...”"
