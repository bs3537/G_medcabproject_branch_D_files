amasseur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cloud-9/reviews/1395538,"“I have been using marijuana to help manage my major depression (among other things) for a couple years now.  I came across Cloud 9 just like any other strain.  It's what my dealer had.  Until I tried Cloud 9 I was more than happy with the marijuana I was getting.  This strain showed me what it is to truly live without depression looming over my head.  It was as if God Himself put this here for me personally.  Every t...”"
Jules24,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cloud-9/reviews/1395539,"“This strain is intense and chill at the same time to say the least. I had 26% and a couple hits and you're definitely on a cloud floatin through sunny skies, but if too much and you might find yourself trippin out a little. Great for hangouts”"
BensBadKush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cloud-9/reviews/1319092,"“Great strain! I was with a friend and smoked a bowl of this strain with a little kief from my old strain blue cheese out of their bubbler. And it was great we were both so happy and just laughing at everything. But we were in public so I would get super parinoid about ever single sound (I was in the woods partly) and for some reason my jaw would just drop every time and for some reason it was so funny for me I would ...”"

VividChaos,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cloud-9/reviews/1296057,"“This is a very euphoric and intense strain.  Your thoughts will wonder, but still come back pretty quickly.  This is a potent strain and if take to much, you have a half angry and half paranoid high.  In the right doses its good for pain and relaxation.”"

purpleurklealienchempantsdogkush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cloud-9/reviews/1351607,"“There's really only one way to describe this strain in its totality: UNBELIEVAMAZABLINGLY WONDERBALLS
The cerebral effects are unmatched (or at least in my experience) and allowed me to eloquently deliver a speech to my friends on how the government is using the forward facing cameras on our iPhones to monitor us 100% of the time we are on them, and how they are compiling a stock of photos from our social media accou...”"

My mind was telling me to get up and get on the elliptical but my body wouldn't let me. So instead we watched Prince's live film Sign 'O' The Times with the surround sound on. It was simply amazing. The high lasted really long and by the time I was coming down my mattress felt like a bed of clouds. Amazing amazi...”"
