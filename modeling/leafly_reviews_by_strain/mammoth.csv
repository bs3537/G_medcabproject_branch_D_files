Mammoth
=============
WSWALTER,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1384698,"“One of the best I've ever had. Lightning fast and clear headed. Amazing for tension headaches and anxiety. No paranoia, only slight confusion. Could have gone to sleep if I needed to but I was working on my computer and that was just fine. Uplifting and relaxing. Top 3.”"
chaseD88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1367956,"“For me it's the perfect bud. Traditionally I prefer a heavy indica due to anxiety but I found that mammoth is indica-relaxing but it is simultaneously stimulating as well so you get the best of both worlds without one over powering the other. Perfect balance.”"
CodyH580,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1366492,"“The Mammoth I recently bought from Solstice in Washington was a very cakey beautiful bud. It's a very mellow social high, that's easy to accomplish tasks with. Definitely a early morning or middle of the day strain. It doesn't stone too hard, yet it loosens you up and makes you feel alright.”"
kbastak,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1372689,"“I honestly love it!! When I'm out and about I have energy to go talk go do stuff and go adventure! I don't get very tired from most strains, one thing I don't really  have a liking for, but it's a good wake a bake strain. Definitely in my top 5 favorite strains”"
KnobHunter,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1376282,"“This strain makes you feel okay with the idea of having a plastic ball placed around you like a bubble boy! Amazing”"
BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1391087,"“These buds smelled just like a mammoth, down right reeked.  That being said they were really nice, perfectly round with bright orange hairs.  Consistently providing full bodied indica effects with a clear head I can see why it's liked but I'll say its not for me. 7.5/10”"
SoHighTech,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1395862,"“Got a great daytime buzz with just a couple hits from a steamroller... very heavy on taste and a light "no cough" exhale. Helped with the shoulder pain and was still able to get some work done without being couched all day. Cheers”"
RustyTrikes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1266353,"“Huge, thick, dense buds.
Tastes earthy, sweet, slightly piney.
Nice, well rounded buzz, slightly leaning towards the indica end of the spectrum.”"
Schitzpopinov,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1266192,"“True to its name regarding flower size and yield. Big fat juicy buds are your reward for taking on this mamma jamma.”"

ManikMenace,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1266668,"“heavy weight strain, immediate instance of internalization. FUN. if your looking to put your mind in a different place, this is most definitely the strain to do that.”"

ursulamajor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1495916,"“This strain does really good for my multiple Sclerosis. It's almost as if it knows morning from night. It acts as an energetic high during the day, and is calming in the evenings. It dulls my pains and smooths out my spasms immediately.”"
Kimmy46,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1529340,"“This is the best i have had  so far, i say so far because these growers are god blessed geniuses.  god bless i am no longer on opiates it is wonderful to know with enough voices the cannabis industry can thrive for everyone”"

Seren,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1284239,"“made me very happy and clear-headed, but not much in the way of pain relief for ovarian cysts”"
rollinpierson2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mammoth/reviews/1319465,"“Just picked up about an 1/8th off my boy of this and this is my favorite strain to date. I've smoked a lot of different strains but this is by far the one I will count on from now on. It's not a stoned feeling so I can act normal in front of people and it just is a perfect day smoke. 10/10 will be smoking often.”"
