Great smoke for people just getting into recreational or MMJ cannabis. The feel is light and cerebral, with roughly the same physical kick as a double shot espresso. PH is going to be any social butterfly's delight.”"

Good daytime strain. Keeps even keel with other daytime strains. Very uplifting and positive sensations. Amazing with a cup of coffee in the morning. 
Does what it's suppose to do. The taste for me, is what sets this strain apart. 
Well done!”"
