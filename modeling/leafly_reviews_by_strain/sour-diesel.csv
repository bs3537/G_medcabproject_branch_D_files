I have had Sour D a few times now and I just can't get that into. The smell is strong and the taste is not good. So why do so many people love this strain? Maybe because it hits hard and fast. For me, it seems more of a mellow sativa that doesn't hang around for long. Its more for daytime use. I took it once by mistake right before bed...‚Äù"
