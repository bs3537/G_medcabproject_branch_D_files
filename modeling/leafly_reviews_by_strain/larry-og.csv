Started smoking to relax after eight hours on my flat feet, got relief in minutes, and sprang up from my armchair to sweep. I was watching Futurama. Do you understand how good of a cartoon that is?

I was able to continue normal life, except that I was in a much better mood while doing so. Felt it throughout my body like a light radiating down my skin and removing all of my stress. Fully at peace with the world. Can help sleep if need be, but I'd recommend it for people who want to be stress-free during the day. Not as helpful with creativity ...”"

Ridiculous all around, one of the best OG kushes that i've ever personally tried. Not very dense, very spear shaped nugs that just reek of lemon skunk ass. Effects are strong, but don't seem to last a very long time, however the taste is always worth going back to. (Unless you don't like the taste of lemons dipped in forest soil.)”"

Briang116,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/larry-og/reviews/1201987,"“Great hybrid!! I get panic attacks from certain strains. Mostly Sativa's I've stuck with 100% indica's bc they haven't caused panic attacks. This one was great no panic at all. Very pleasant and mellow not to strong and didn't couch lock me like some other indica's. Found a good day time medicine!!”"

My cheeks and nose felt a bit numb and tingly. Not entirely pleasant but it faded shortly after and I was soon fascinated with how my brain lit up like Times Square on New Years Eve. Very uplifting and invigorating. I recommend waiting a bit before loading up a second round.”"

This argument almost escalated into a fist fight. My anxiety was shooting from my fingertips down to my ankles. i left the party before i had heart attack infront of the surrounding crowd. i smoked my medicine out of my honeycomb water pipe for pure filtration.

Taste is smooth but odd.  Inhale smooth with no cough, exhale smooth but left a weird after taste.  If you hit it hard it will relax and is enjoyable but did not do much for pain relief.  If this were the only strain available I would  be ok but likely won't pick it again if there is a choice.  I broke u...”"

bidr2001,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/larry-og/reviews/1185895,"“if you get the right strain of Larry this OG will blow you away.  I'm talking picked right. Indoor.  Og smelling fruity but fuel like.  Nugs of different sizes, not that dispensary uniform shit.  I just picked up a QP of some dank fuzzy buds. Perfect. If you say you don't like this you are smoking some brick weed.”"

Much better hit and made quite a difference.  Rather hard buzz and it did help with ticking the pain down a couple of notches.  Happy I gave it a second try!  Still not the best I have tried but it holds its weight!”"

Earthy, gardeny, and piney like fresh soil. Grassy and buttered popcorn with back ends of skunk. Extreme body buzz, stress obliterated, maximum relaxation and appetite. 5/5!!!”"
