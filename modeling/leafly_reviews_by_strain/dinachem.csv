TheManOnDaMoon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dinachem/reviews/1389522,"“First came across this strain when I moved to Colorado the Neighbors love growing anything with chemdawg thus stumbling on to this strain. I was a happy man buying a  half ounce for 65-75 only was a clear steal.”"

Anonystonermous289,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dinachem/reviews/1419399,"“Makes you laugh at yourself while you personify cars and shit. It just makes everything funnier. It's 65% sativa, 35% indica which gives it a great mixture between head and body highs. It's probably my favourite strain to date, would definitely recommend!”"
