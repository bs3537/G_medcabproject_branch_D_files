Light of Jah
=============
bakerman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1398551,"“A strain with very impressive genetics, perhaps not as popular as it should be. I was fortunate enough to get hold of some high grade LoJ, if you get a chance to try this I would definitely recommend it.

I think it comes from a mostly sativa haze background but it's not like any haze I've ever tried, it hits you as you smoke. People say it's a long lasting high but I can't confirm that, I was with friends so I sup...”"
DrNnja,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1418610,"“I live in Colorado so have the luxury of being able to shop for herb. I've been on the hunt for my "perfect" sativa. Most give me anxiety, at least for awhile, and when I'm out adventuring in nature and the mountains, I don't want to feel anxious at all. I just bought LOJ for the first time, and it is the most uplifting, fun, stress-free, happy, energetic sativa high I've ever had. I had zero anxiety and paranoia, wh...”"

sfsurfer87,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1325240,"“The effects are mainly cerebral with a mildly euphoric body high.  This strain leaves you feeling uplifted and energized yet also remaining surprisingly clear headed. Very good daytime strain for when you need to be active. Similar effects as J1, XJ-13, Jack Herer.”"
lymanx,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1324717,"“Smoked a chillum of home grown, indoor. The seed bank I bought it from described it as a Jack Herer x Afghani hybrid. Flavor is earthy, some spice. The high is a crisp, heady, buoyant buzz. I like it as a daytime strain. Ya mon.”"
DVA,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1362807,"“Light of Jah takes you up and keeps you there for hours. Mostly cerebral and tingly at first, like those "Pop Rock" candies that sizzled in your mouth as a kid. Feels like your cerebral cortex is being innervated by nitrous oxide, and its a bit giggly if you have never had it before and don't know what to expect. You eventually level out at a cruising altitude above all cloud cover so you can beam down to the planet ...”"
snakemittens,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1277819,"“The high set on in about 10 minutes. at first the was a very heady rush followed by a nice calming but energetic body high. I had major cotton mouth however. the biggest downside of the strain for me was the taste, didn't make me gag but enough for me not to get it again. I give it a strong 7 out of 10!”"
Ghastborne,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1362808,"“Considering it's strong Afghan landrace roots, it is an intense head high with mild bodily effects. Does well with the inflecting mind.”"

cmaria,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1460567,"“I vaped a bit of this and I’m feeling relaxed, definitely in a nice mellow mood, not worried about running a bit late. The taste has some heat to it with some mango undertones. It’s smooth, doesn’t make me cough harshly and doesn’t tickle my nose. Definitely daytime relaxation.”"
LilStoneyNell,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1416871,"“A really nice upbeat strain. This is perfect for after work. Shit, maybe even perfect FOR work. Wonderful taste and all around even high. No munchies or drowsiness on the come down. Prepare for intelligent conversation tho if smoked in a group. Light of Jah really does have you feeling connected to God. Not the strain to discuss the Spice Girls' popularity over...”"
MindRite,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1255133,"“Both a strong cerebral and warm body experience, this is a top notch muscle relaxant and anti-anxiety solution.  A very fuzzy, forgetful, and outstanding recreational high, Light of Jah is recommended only after the important stuff is done for the day.  Patients new to Cannabis should use caution consuming this strain, as it can come on quite strong.  A couch lock lord and cotton mouth king, break out that juicer and...”"
jaceyx84,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1499804,"“I suffer from ptsd and crazy bad anxiety. I have a number of other health issues, but it helped the most with these the most. I actually felt high after 2 bowls, and my tolerance is pretty high up, but I couldn't keep the smile off my face while it was in effect. I was blessed to get this from an amazing person, and I certainly will not forget the favor.”"

epochalypse,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1288295,"“One of the clearest headed, purely uplifting and euphoric sativa highs out there. Similar to the happiest of Jack Herer's phenotypes, yet the clarity and texture of the high are more akin to XJ-13, it's close cousin. 

The taste is a hazy and spicy pepper musk over a ripe floral funk with just the slightest hint of citrus bite at the end. Really a fantastic strain of the highest caliber, and I'm a jaded old school st...”"

YungSoose,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1232257,"“Got some big chunky nugs with tons of hair and trichomes when you cracked the bud open. The hairs were also in tight clusters which made to dark orange hairs stand out even more. Smelled kinda weird to me at first but the smell grew on me peppery earthy herb smell good classic sativa high that seemed to take a little to have its full effect.”"

Brandog484,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1314772,"“I've only used it 3 or so times as of this review, but it has to be my favorite strain I've had thus far. I have no idea how to make ice cream, yet I decided that I must learn how. And I did. And it was pretty damn good. I was pretty far gone at the time too. Happy and social, then relaxed and sleepy. Best high for a weeknight”"

jbanners,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/light-of-jah/reviews/1258847,"“It is a really clear crisp high. 

I felt relatively alert and it ready to go about doing my daily business without being overly stupefied. 

It is very talkative, and euphoric. I like mixing it with a little bit of a high CBD strain to cut a little of the Sativa edge, but that is a personal preference.

The taste is way more citric than the smell. 

The smell is extremely earthy while the taste is very citric.”"
