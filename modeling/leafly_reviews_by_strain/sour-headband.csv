Haithem,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-headband/reviews/1392926,"“Excellent. A true sativa that will keep you functional to get through your workday.

rwhidden,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-headband/reviews/1390538,"“the original headband is already a cross of sour diesel and og kush... so this is just headband with double the sour diesel.”"
QiTH8N,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-headband/reviews/1390539,"“Love this strain! Best of both my favorites, Sour Diesel and Headband, combined into one gorgeously dank package. Gives you a fantastic relaxing, but still alert and energetic high. Have a headache, this will knock it right out.”"
AkaTeddd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-headband/reviews/1390531,"“Love Sour Kush or Sour headband big fan like most people of diesel.Picked up x's from in El Mirage AZ.Love this strain for ADL's or to help with migraines and hyper-vigilance with out and about public activity's.Feel on top of the world with ease in my tension and anxiety.”"

The fact they crossed these two strains provides a phenomenal head high with awesome euphoria and upliftedness.. If that's a word lol. But has a nice mellow body high too. Definitely is something to have day or night. Just smoked a blow right now and I feel fucking great!”"
Topiarist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-headband/reviews/1393428,"“Still trying to find the right dose. With my previous lid, Gsc, you can smoke a pinch, go do what you need to do and be flying straight in quite a short time. Ideal for the busy parent. I find Srh a bit... muddy. Need to smoke more to get to the same place, except it isn't the same place. Can't quite put my finger on it. Sure, you can take a grizzly sized dose and have a whale of a time, but that's often just not wha...”"

NewReleaf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sour-headband/reviews/1412273,"“This review is very subjective in the sense that I rarely enjoy high THC Sativas. I know this is a hybrid but it leans heavy on the Sativa dominance. The absence of a counter balance of CBD in this particular strain makes for some potential negative mental affects. 

I tried this strain because of my love for Headband by itself. With that said, I would love to see this strain crossed with an ac/dc or Sour Tsunami typ...”"

Once you open the jar of this strain, immediately the room is full of a sour, pungent has smell. The flavor taste just like it smells, and finishes with subtle notes of grapefruit. Plan to do something after consumption, the energy surge is too much to just sit still. The affect mostly stays ce...”"

Very uplifting, slightly energetic, yet slightly relaxing. A great euphoria. Talkative with red dry eyes. The physical effects are concentrated in the head. Smoke is flavorful lemon skunk diesel. A middle weight imo with an abrupt cough leaving my face looking like a bit a lemon. Diesel and chem linger in the taste of the exhale. Buds look pict...”"

I am still laughing because my character gets lost in a sewer full of dead bodies and rats to retrieve a cursed penny because I was the smallest person there and can fit in a drainage grate.  I felt the effects for 9 hours with 2 hits at 8pm and 1 at 11.  I think it is over 20% thc.”"

With famous parents, Sour Band is the North West of the Cannabis world and just like Kanye's little girl these nugs are beautiful and crusted in diamonds. Expect a strong earthy lemon diesel aroma that carries over on the palate, a sure to love for Sour Diesel fans, with a unique high that shares some of the classic Headband brain pinch.
