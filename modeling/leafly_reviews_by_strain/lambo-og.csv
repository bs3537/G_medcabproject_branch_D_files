Lambo OG
=============
ChronicallyStoned,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lambo-og/reviews/1062166,"“This strain is perfect for someone who has high tolerance because of chronic pain. It actually took nearly all my pain away and still gave me the munchies which is great because I have difficulties eating due to my issues. Has become my true favorite.”"
Krittick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lambo-og/reviews/1062170,"“Keep this one handy for pain relief. It helps in a big way and never disappoints. You'll get quite sleepy after a while, but once the high wears off there's no trace of tiredness left. Dark colored nugs, with a more muted smell and a mild good earthy aftertaste.”"
Cygnus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lambo-og/reviews/1370641,"“Lambo OG. This is not for the faint of heart! My personal experience found a fairly intense high, especially upon first smoke of the day. I felt extremely zoned out, light, but still a pleasant high. NEWBIES: try smoking a bud your familiar with PRIOR to smoking Lambo if you are not familiar with this strain. I would definitely recommend it!”"
Catitude,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lambo-og/reviews/1075137,"“Purely a Flavor commentary :-)
I have hypersensitive tastebuds & cannot tolerate many of the sweeter varieties. This is yummy with a flavor shift between inhale & exhale.
Amaretto inhale to a vanilla, metallic lime exhale”"

aroddhomes,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lambo-og/reviews/1304898,"“This was a great typical OG strain good for sleep and great for body inflammation overall headbanger.”"
krime340,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lambo-og/reviews/1234831,"“On my 3rd season growing this beauty. I've so far gotten two different phenotypes of this strain. One pheno shows a more afghani kush bud form with a sativa growth structure not too strong in odor, the second pheno which is my favorite shows a more indica structure with wide leaves. The smell is incredible and very noticeable pungent lavender buds full of white trichomes, very good outdoors and very resistant to mold...”"
CaptainKrc,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lambo-og/reviews/1162829,"“It's a great well rounded strain but the indica effects are a little more pronounced. Super danky OG taste with an intense high! This is one of my new favorites. Don't pass it up if you can find a high quality stain of Lambo OG.”"
LoudTrees4Days,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lambo-og/reviews/1231692,"“It's decent but it's not the very best high for me, but others might enjoy it more. Definitely some loud, just not my personal favorite.”"

ChronicallyStoned,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lambo-og/reviews/1062167,"“New batch at THC in Van Nuys has Trich's gleaming all over. This batch will numb your lower half, and your eyelids will not want to stay open.  Good heavy frontal lobe high, def not your typical OG feeling. Perfect strain.”"
kidchiefer,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/lambo-og/reviews/1062165,"“i love this bud strain so much. I usually never come get the same weed but the Lambo is the true fire people. I Love You Foothill Caregivers”"
