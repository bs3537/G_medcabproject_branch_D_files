The sweet tastes and aroma of the Cherry Pie with the Strong sedative effects of the Zombie. Treats all sorts of conditions especially cramps, spasms, nausea and Insomnia.”"

DeepRootsMike,https://www.leafly.com/indica/zoom-pie/reviews/1724958,"“Exceptional in every way. The aroma reminds me of grandaddy purp. The first taste is super sweet, with a heavy cherry/berry exhale. Halfway through the joint I was already pretty stoned. Almost mixed the wrong nutes for my garden 😂. 45 min in I'm melted into the couch and hungry as hell. Some of the best flower I have had in a while. Very strongly recommend for nighttime use.”"
