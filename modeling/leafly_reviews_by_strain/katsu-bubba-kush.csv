Every INDICA strain IMO has qualities other may not, so I have found in 50+years of testing if you have certain medical needs try as many strains as ya can.....
I usually go with well known strains from the 70’s like Northern Lights, Blueberry, OG18 buT it’s the little niche strain...”"

To my amazement, it helped more than any other strain I've tried in the past. It actually made me feel how I used to feel before the PTSD. I didn't even think that was possible. It's also very relaxing and smells & tastes great !!!”"
PoisonIvy25,https://www.leafly.com/indica/katsu-bubba-kush/reviews/1441360,"“I bought a vape pen cartridge of this strain produced by the cultivar Cresco at my local dispensary recently. It was suggested to me by my budtender as a good night time medicine to treat severe pain, muscle spasms, and insomnia. It performs as a typical indica in that it slowed me down a bit and made it easier to fall asleep but I wasn't impressed at all with the pain relief or muscle relaxation. Even though this wa...”"

   Fell in love from the first moment I cracked open my Cresco bottle.  Sweet and velvety aromas just overwhelm the pallet.  
   Once you hit this donkey, that's where the magic begins.  I used this medicine to quell some muscle spasms, it also stopped an oncoming migraine dead in its tracks.  Honestly though, I wou...”"

A heavy body relaxation is joined by a very fun cerebral high. I had that heavy, pleasant, can't move feeling, well not really "can't move", but more along the lines of "why bother moving" feeling.

Not truly a 'put me to sleep' Indica. However, you will be couch locked. Don't expect to do too much productive if you over indulge. But if you're looking for micro-dosing for pain it does a great job. It's perfect for relaxing the mu...”"

This concentrate has a good waxy consistency that crumbles with too much pressure. So handling it gently helps a lot, but even when it does crumble it is still very easy to scoop up with a spoon dab tool. The flavor is clean with havy green chlorophyll flavor. The effect is typical of heavy indica strains. It is very effective for relaxation and to aid with...”"

For being so strong it is incredible easy on the lungs when smoked. Good for sleep , but can use during the day if home with nothing to do. It’s not as great as alien bubba kush , but is a very similar sister product”"

It feels calming and subsides my pain for about 3 hours with only a few hits. Doesn't have me too vegged out, great indica for day and night activities. The terpene flavor profile gives the concentrate a great clean and fruity kush. Has helped with some nausea.”"

The@Zman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/katsu-bubba-kush/reviews/1592190,"“Katsu Bubba is a potent strain with Euphoric effects. For me the downside was it came with some anxiety especially in a larger dose. Its more manageable in a smaller dose. Definitely helps with pain and inflammation. Because of the anxiety factor i wouldn't recommend for insomnia.”"
