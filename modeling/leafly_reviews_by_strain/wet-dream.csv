adamz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1390261,"“Really amazing bud. I've smoked about 25 strains so far, and this is by far my favorite. You can feel the effects almost immediately, and they are so powerful and amazing. You feel uplifted, as if you were in a dream. With Blue Dream, OG Kush, and Haze genetics, this is the dopest dope i've ever smoked.”"
oilbog,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1371525,"“I give this strain a 7/10 it starts with uplifting euphoric energetic effects and slowly turns into a relaxing sleepiness the smell is woody and flowery and it tastes like lemon grass”"
kriswak86,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1354393,"“Bought this bc the price was way too nice but wasn't sure what to expect... But I didn't expect that it would be as good as it is. Love the background of this strain. If you haven't you might want to try this”"
Kerouac,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1348701,"“I acclimated to Blue Dream and when I asked the budtender at Point Loma Patients Association to recommend a similar strain, she came up with Wet Dream from Blue Dream and OB Haze. OB is Ocean Beach, a local neighborhood.  I really like this, a great daytime strain with good clear energy, a wicked fast onset and sustained high, nice taste, very pretty formation.  I would say the analgesic effect is medium.  I am going...”"
KantianConsciousness,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1373178,"“I love this strain! Great focus and clarity, with euphoric body rush as a kicker. Day or night, this one helps me feel just right.

Combine with GDP at night for a really interesting dream sequence! 

Added bonus: have a special friend join you and enjoy mutual bodily contact at an elevated level of pleasure!”"

SourDeeznutz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1327905,"“I rolled up a fat cone of this and smoked it on the beach when I was in San Diego a couple months ago. Before that I was unaware that the strain existed, or that it had been created by Slightly Stoopid. It was awesome. The high had the smooth mental buzz of blue dream, but with a body high added in. Great for depression, stress, and pretty much anything else during the daytime. Despite the body high, it didn't make m...”"

Infamousbb,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1327904,"“Like a creamier blue dream. Definitely has those haze genetics. I am not a clean person, but my apartment was spotless after a doobie of this deliciousness.”"

dEEzEE,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1285087,"“A hybrid of Blue Dream and OB haze from Ocean Beach area of San Diego, Ca. A smoke that is way more enjoyable then regular Blue & after trying it makes Blue seem a bit plain. Good day strain.”"
emanuel80,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1371521,"“70% nice little headache, nice high creeping more and more.  Worth money.  Wax. 19 a gram, portland Oregon”"
Cmunz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1371524,"“wow. Light green  airy nuggets frosted like snow, perfect manicure. Aroma is complex like a fine aged wine that modulates over time revealing terpenes of sage , rosemary, pepper, cocoa, fruit. Devoid of any dank skunk or diesel  aromas. Sweet spicy flavor. High is very uplifting and happy, like a relaxed sunny day at the beach. This sativa dominant strain perfectly demonstates the difference between "high" and an ind...”"

DankyDani,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1390383,"“i got some of wet dream yesterday when the dispensary ran out of Blue Dream, which I use to treat symptoms of Bipolar disorder. It was suggested as an alternative because the budtender said the effects are similar. He super downplayed this strain, in my opinion, and for only $10 a gram! Just wow! It did not effect me immediately, for me it creeped up on me in a very nice mellow way. I smoked around 9:30pm, then took ...”"
WillCodeFor420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1390200,"“This was a pleasant surprise. The taste is slightly woody and lemon with a hint of spice. Really smooth smoke with very little coughing from a blunt and next to none with a water pipe. For me the high takes a little longer to kick in, like after 10 mins. Once the high initially sets in, there is a rush of energy. This is an amazing wake and bake strain. Then the second high kicks in and you feel the indica, keeping y...”"
suckitup,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1371518,"“This will def be a go to for me from now on! I like a sativa-leaning hybrid and Wet Dream certainly lives up to its name! I'm a seasoned smoker so it usually takes a lot for me to feel any effects of marijuana. 3-4 pipe hits of this bad boy had my feeling good, happy, focused and no couch lock. Love at first puff!”"

MedicalRebel,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1253402,"“This strain was amazing, very uplifting, but not too energetic, it keeps me up and medicated, however when it wears off you do get sleepy so I suggest this for afternoons. I do suggest this to seasoned or veteran smokers due to its heavy onset that can cause couchlock, not to mention the coughing, boy this flower really did my lungs in. A 3/5 very good stuff will smoke again.”"
sarah97austin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1253820,"“So good. I took a day and felt so relaxed but was 100% awake. I would recommend to everyone, especially those who fall asleep quickly.”"
jayyyyneeeee,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1283272,"“relaxing, can taste that blue dream a bit.  Gives me a very alert but calming effect.  Glad i was recommended this!  I will say i like this over a blue dream because it's more peaceful.”"

Ionit,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1617457,"“When your friend is visiting from out of the town, take this punchy strain along for all of the outdoor excursions. Conversations will easily flow and vibes will stay very positive. Easy to stay focused. Pairs well with: food, disc golf, and light beer.”"
Psychedelic1420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1681699,"“How come no one told me this strain has no taste? I’m disappointed. I’m hoping the effects are better than the taste but I enjoy the smell and taste of bud. I’m going to mix this with other strains like sour diesel or green crack for a stronger kick.”"

OBBread,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1243870,"“Wet Dream is an OB staple. I love this strain- it has a beautiful look, smell, feel, high.. you name it. It makes me proud to know this is a local creation. I tend to favor indicas, so I get wet dream less these days. But when I am in the mood for a daytime sativa and have the money, there is nothing I would rather have than some WET DREAM.”"

Bambi710,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1223453,"“this strain was pretty nice. It tasted very much like haze. the effects didn't give me the energetic haze I was looking for, it was more along the lines of a heavy hitting blue dream. wouldn't call what I had a sativa”"

JorgeDeLaSelva,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1249233,"“Very uplifting, hight energy, strain with some cool visual effects. Great for outdoor endeavors. Only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars is the crash that comes when it wears off. About three or four hours after smoking if I can't take a nap I feel yucky.”"

90265livin,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1226264,"“Best strain that I've ever tried. Tastes better than the vast majority of strains that I've had and is super smooth so it's easy to take huge hits. 10/10 would definitely recommend if available at your local dispensaries.”"

THC total - 75.43
CBD total - 0.51

The taste is nothing to write home about , and it's kinda harsh - but it will give you an instant rush ... And you feel it in the face.  
I've been using this for daytime medication.  Although it doesn't give you the energy & lift like say their Tangie live , but nonetheless it's a good buzz. 
I personally probably w...”"
bbeat,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/wet-dream/reviews/1324669,"“It didn't look very good so I wasn't too excited to smoke it but once I smoked a few bowls I was pleasantly surprised.  Gives the nice strong whole body euphoria with the nice feeling of not being able to stop smiling. Great for smoking at concerts or when hanging out with friends. Usually don't smoke this strain after around 10 a clock though because falling asleep on this strain really just feels like a waste.”"
