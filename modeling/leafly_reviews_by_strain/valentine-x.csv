Valentine X
=============
TheRavenAZ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1368794,"“Having heard this was akin to ACDC with a CBD to THC ratio of 25:1, I desperately wanted to find this.   A dispensary nearby finally started carrying it so I bought some.   I was so excited that I had found something like ACDC since I have a very low tolerance for THC and a negative reaction to even a moderate amount of it.  I was assured by the budmaster at the dispensary that this wouldn't get me high since it had ...”"

I found that packing one bowl for one it was much more effective than trying to pack a full bowl. You want to leave the leaves exposed on this one if you're smoking it in a pipe or bong, it seems to increase the surface area and the euphoric effects of this is much faster than most strands I've experienced.

Tarquinp,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1351729,"“I was incredibly impressed with this low THC strain. I've had my medical card for a while now so I've accumulated quite a tolerance, and I must say that after smoking about .7g I was sufficiently high, incredibly sloppy, and very happy.”"

wolfhow1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1311587,"“This is my favorite medical strain. It works well in tincture for a sustained effect and vaporized for higher blood levels and immediate, but shorter lived response. This strain can be as high in CBD:THC ratio as 26:1. CBDA transforms to CBD and is absorbed better from raw plant with high CBDA than decarboxylated plant with high CBD (as much as 4 times increased absorption), but the body's transformation and absorpti...”"

beachlivin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1354523,"“I loved this strain! I have an auto immune disease and was recommended the Valentine X tincture and ointment to help with nerve pain. I have a VERY low tolerance to THC and the SoCal budtender (San Diego) said theirs tested 20:1. I have not tried smoking it yet but the tincture worked amazingly well: a few drops under my tongue and pain subsided in about 20 min. I felt relaxed but not the "high" or sedative effects. ...”"
JustSid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1358290,"“Strain has high cbd levels and it was suggested to me due to my request for a strain without THC. This is a relaxing strain, with some euphoria as well as some sleepiness. This is very stress reducing and calms the nerves in both a physical way and mentality. I have chronic migraines and anxiety and this strain definately put me at ease and made me forget the pain I was experiencing and allowed me to just sit and rel...”"

tenfreeverses,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1216662,"“I wanted to weigh in on this because I'm sensitive to THC and this strain was perfect for me! I ordered it from a delivery service in SoCal - very pleasant, tingly body buzz and I didn't feel paranoid or too "in my head" at all.”"
Jahhvie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1358288,"“I'm really sensitive to THC and have had some really bad experiences in the past with anxiety and paranoia. This strain is so great for helping with those problems. I feel very relaxed but still alert and focused. Once it starts to fade a bit I get super calm and relaxed and ready to sleep. All in all a great strain if you're new to smoking or want something with low THC and high CBD.”"
Chadd720,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1551320,"“Fucking love this strain! Was very curious to try it because of its CBD dominant 25:1 and found it very surprising. I didn’t think you will get “smacked” off of it, but you can. It’s a definite body high with a head buzz. Very tingly, and talkative feeling.”"
sqwkr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1354522,"“I have really severe pain and have been trying any and all things cbd to try to relieve some of this pain. nothing has given me as much relief as Valentine X without any major psychoactive effects. This is amazing!!!”"
OsideCannabisCulture,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1678753,"“I,m completely Impressed with this strain, I had no Idea high CBD 25% with only 1% THC could be so awesome! and everyone I have given it to loves it the same...  you should try it!”"
mendoO,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1456948,"“Thin branches. Many Big colas. Good juicing plant. Powdery mildew resistant. Smells like pineapple. Purchased this clone at LOVE IN IT COLLECTIVE in Mendocino.”"
queendivine313,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1229472,"“Good body buzz n head high while also having 13% cbd. It taste sweet berry punch. Sticky n very strong fruit smell... I love it!”"

oceanbutterfly,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/valentine-x/reviews/1275187,"“I second everything from TheRavenAZ's review, as I had a similar experience the second time I bought this strain. 
The first time, buying it from the dispensary I normally use, I loved it!  It gave me calm motivation, helped with seizures, pain and anxiety. 

A few months later, I got some from a different, unknown to me dispensary, since it was the only one in AZ carrying it at the time. 
It was an agonizing 4-6 hou...”"
