trippytaoist,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1413298,"“Sweet Dreams is a better night-time smoke than even some pure indicas, but don't let that put you off enjoying this gentle hybrid in the early evening. To me, Sweet Dreams has a really unique feel, and is perfect for anxiety alleviation or just relaxing during the day. It's not an intense relaxation- it doesn't give your sense of self an experiential Turkish bath like some strains do. It's mellow, floaty, and gentle-...”"

dynastic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1453496,"“I dunno, I like a little more truth in advertising. For me this is not the gentle, sleepy experience discussed in other reviews and the strain description. It is much closer to being hit in the forehead with a sledgehammer. A couple of hits of this and you pretty much get slammed into the couch almost senseless for a couple of hours. You are very high, but not very aware.”"
tabarnaQC,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1378788,"“one of my favorites "medically", relieves my anxiety so well and helps to put me in a gooood sleep! strong "kush-skunky" smell and aromas, love it!”"
Robs213,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1258708,"“Smoking this strain from Los Angeles CA, The name says it all, Sweet Dreams, has an amazing sweet smell, and gives you a good head high, lazy free! goes good with a sunny weather. Almost 4/20!”"
renvee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1367707,"“I didn't experience this to be a heavy indica as some other reviews have mentioned. This strain did relax me but did not make me sleepy. Things felt a little hazey but I was still pretty alert. I actually experienced some difficulty sleeping that evening. Not a good strain before bed, more of an after-work kind of strain.”"
gmillion1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1314030,"“Smoked this in Amsterdam, and man, it's true, you think you are just a high tolerate smoker and you will only get a little effect, then BAM, it hits you, although I did not get sleepy, just relaxed. I actually really enjoyed the come down effect more than ever, really at peace with earth.”"

BuddhaOgKush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1544893,"“So I tried Sweet dreams for the first time about a week ago, and I right away fell in love. This is a hybrid Indica dominate strain, right away once you opened the container you right away smell this skunky, Kush like ammonia smell. The buds we perfectly trimmed and very green, it smokes real smooth, and it has a musty-earth flavor to it which to me taste perfectly. It does have a tendency to creep up on you though, ...”"
MorganReptar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1286961,"“Hands down the best strain I've ever had! VERY strong and relaxing! Not a strong scent, but the smoke is smooth. Bud is dense and the flower is gorgeous. It's the definition of couch lock!”"
punkassbutch,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1265217,"“i had two experiences with this, one great, one awful. the first time was awesome. i was a little sluggish and was definetly a poor choice of strain for going hiking, but i was relaxed and happy. the second time i smoked more and i had a hard time with depth perception, walking, and communicating as if i was sober. i had to stay in bed the rest of the night because i felt so incapable moving. good in moderation, but ...”"

MichaelSweeney,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1328371,"“I really enjoyed this strain.  I only rated this strain as a 3, because i was able to feel the high quickly after I had lit up and inhailed a few puffs, but it was a gentle high.  I picked up reading my book "have a little faith- Mitch albom" and my lady read an article to me about Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) something she suffers with, but than a second wave came into play when I was about to take a shower...”"
juddsonlee,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1263039,"“Exactly as stated. Not quite a 4, yet better than a 3.5. Nice.”"
Mellowlife,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1286071,"“let's get one thing straight. the only reason I'm giving it three stars is because of how sleepy it made me ! I'm normally not too fond of indica type strains as much as I am w/ sativa ! I like being giggly :-D although, the smell is very appealing ! I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who's just trying to catch some z's asap lol.”"

Transit22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1794356,"“This strain will make you relaxed and comfortable. Perfect for relieving stress or after a day of smoking sativa to wind down. It made me feel cuddly which is rare for me so my girlfriend appreciated that.”"
CB1CB2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1300967,"“Sweet dreams is a wonderful tasting strain- almost a creamy hoppy flavor. I enjoyed it- didn't find its properties to be too suited for patients with high pain. It was however still a tasty smoke.”"

FireMarshallBill,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1440171,"“Better than the Manson song when it comes to knocking your butt out and sleeping without worries. Fruity and earthy but indica dominant for sure. Great bud! And not for amateurs”"
BeaArthurKush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1759109,"“This was marked as a seasonal (late fall) strain here in Chicago. It did not, however, give me sweet dreams. I felt like some naive high school kid that got sold oregano; this stuff didn’t get me high at all.”"
Packemlate,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1760215,"“Smooth ! From Gold leaf. Very rare I find a strain that I put my guard sown and just start running at the mouth , but ole sweety got me . Creeps into a nice body buzz . If you see this give it a chance a very nice flower !”"

chicagopatient,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sweet-dreams/reviews/1626648,"“This 1000 mL oil tank from PTS, is the only current indica offering in the 1000 mL tank product line. The flavor is very heavy pine with a myr/sage finish. The terpenes are very strong and the flavor was off-putting for me. The first few puffs felt like pine cleaning fluid. The effect was moderate relaxation, pain relief, and clearing of invasive thoughts. This was also the only tank from PTS that I tried which clogg...”"
