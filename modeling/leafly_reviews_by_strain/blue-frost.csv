demis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-frost/reviews/1417222,"‚ÄúI'm a veteran smoker, born and raised in southern Humboldt County, and this is by far my favorite flower. Best smelling, tasting and best high. It's very hard to describe the taste ; but my best description would be blueberry /purple kush/ cheese blend . The high is very nice body high and a powerful "head" high. I recommend this to patients who suffer from depression , pain, anxiety and insomnia to name a few. There...‚Äù"
hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-frost/reviews/1383302,"‚ÄúI'm a sativa person but this is wonderfully indica dominant. Makes me think I should sample more strains of this kind. Just  fabulous weed. A blissful evening.  I admire breeders who come up with these remarkable strains.  We have to appreciate the growers as well.  They keep the weed world alive.‚Äù"
up2eleven,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-frost/reviews/1412060,"‚ÄúA few months ago, I returned from my non-weed hiatus of at least a decade. Things have definitely changed! I've been exploring various strains to see which works best for me. 

Blue Frost has light and fluffy buds and a mellow scent. The high doesn't hit instantly, but warms up pretty quickly and about 5-10 minutes later you're on the ride. It's got a very nice mix of mellowness and alertness. You're not zonked out a...‚Äù"

I tried to get my hands on as many strains as I could try. Then something changed in my brain wiring and I could no longer ingest THC at all without having a terrible paranoid cannabis psychosis (FULL ON! Hallucinosis, delirium, the works...) ...

hotheadpaisan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-frost/reviews/1410272,"‚ÄúThis strain smells amazing. Fruity, herbal, delicious. Vaporizes smoothly. 
High starts with an immediate burst of euphoria. Good for relaxing without getting sleepy or couchlocked. Nice mood improver; I like to use a little after work while cooking dinner. A good medicine for day or night. Helpful for migraine pain relief. A little bit of dry mouth, depending how much you use, but not bad. Highly recommend!‚Äù"

ThisOneTimeAtUmass,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-frost/reviews/1529670,"‚ÄúDelicious daytime strain. Hints of blueberry and grated cheese in the flavor. Sounds a little odd, tastes amazing. High is really nice, very heady mellow euphoria, some body effects, not at all sleepy. Great first thing in the morning, or anytime of day.
