Blue Dream is one of my favorite strains of flower, so I knew I would like this combo. Smooth head high after two hits. Felt very euphoric and happy.

I wouldn't say it's my funnest strain but in the category of balance this is number 1.  I've smoked a lot of top shelf strains and this is probably my favorite for interaction and here's why.  No negative side effects, it's the first one without any paranoia, cotton mouth, dry eyes ect.  You smoke it and...”"

The sativa brings a nice head high with added focus, content, and entertainment, while the indica brings a nice mellowing body high and tingle. Great for ADD/ADHD, depression, anxiety, and Bipolar.

But then I realized it was very Sativa dominant and I was more focused and energized rather then "Stuck" like I get when I stick with my Indica varieties. If I'm looking to relax and feel euphoric, this wouldn't be my go to. But man when I've got some work to do, this is my go to.”"

Beautiful nug structure, crystals to hairs both in plentyful,
smell is unlike the blue dream in that it holds more of dark fruit as opposed to a somewhat tropical pungent fruit.
It also has less of a pungent smell in comparison, with the replaced fresh sweet smell.
Solid strain, and a must try! For those who know, it becomes a try and try again :)
