Root Beer Kush

AcidBlitz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/root-beer-kush/reviews/1371309,"“The first thing you notice with this weed is the beautifully overwhelming smell of root beer. That's the only smell you get from it. Next is taste. I'm waiting for my vaporizer to arrive in the mail, so I did my first session with RB Kush through a pipe. I will do a re-review with the Vaporizer. Anyways, even from smoking, I sill got an unexpected surprise. I was expecting a nice root beer smell and more earthy taste...”"

However, the delicious kush-y undertones are highlighted by sweetest notes of vanilla 💥 — so taste + flavor do compensate a bit! It’s definitely a mind-booster, creativity-wise, & the...”"

I smoked 11 bowls, the majority of which were vaporized, and it tasted so perfect, hit as smoothly as a 300 bong, and produced a lot of body buzz.”"

hgds,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/root-beer-kush/reviews/1061135,"“It is absolutely amazing how much this strain smells like rootbeer. It quite literally smells like it was drenched in rootbeer syrup. Subtle Kush notes are found underneath. The strain feels like an indica and provides you with mild euphoria, nothing overpowering. A very very odd yet good rootbeer taste is strongly present in the smoke. The effects hit you quite quickly and you will instantly notice that this is simi...”"

At least there should be a disclaimer mentioning that. Still tastes great though, dont get me wrong, but was much cooler when i thought it grew like that .”"
Constant_StateOfMeep,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/root-beer-kush/reviews/1244447,"“THE tastiest bud I've ever come across with that very distinct, sweet vanilla flavor.  I can't wipe the Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure smile from my face, and I like it!  The high doesn't bog you down one bit though.

Good morning medicine to get your head in the game for the day ahead, great for anxiety and depression and it has a nice little kick to it that is helpful when that morning coffee just isn't cutting...”"

Pain melts away and stress levels taper off as it takes hold slowly. Indica? Sativa? Imagine a Root Beer Dream...yeah, its that good! Great flower for both novice and veterans if you can find it!”"

Rootbeerish for sure. As for the reviewer saying the bud is sprayed? Lol maybe YOUR supplier does that. Has nothing to do with the strain.”"

I consider myself to be a pretty seasoned smoker, and I had a joint of this leftover from some time ago. Now I know why it was left over.

It smelled great and tasted good, but the effects on me were not so great. It caused me to feel isolated, withdrawn, and underscored my “selectively social” tendencies rather than blurring them into the background. 

As a result, not a strain for me. I would recommend mind...”"

Anyways this smells and tastes of rootbeer. Its unmistakable. Like a dessert bud. Id keep this around as a treat. Its good. Nothin magical. But better than average.
