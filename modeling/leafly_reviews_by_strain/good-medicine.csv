It is difficult to find a strain that can relieve some of the anxiety and hyper-vigilance, encourage relaxation, while allowing me to get things done.  The higher the THC level, especially in Sativas, the worse the anxiety for me.  This strain has a much lower THC level with a high amount of CBD which accomplishes my goals mentioned above.  This is my stap...”"

Good Medicine restored my faith in marijuana. The low THC and the high CBD provided me with a gentle stone while still having complete cognizance and no couch-lock. It was like being caressed in a warm, safe hug. Lots of munchies and laughter. No anxiety whatsoever. Just peace and relaxation. Also aided in n...”"

I feel relaxed, euphoric, at ease, pain gone, etc. All I need is 3 hits off a bowl or 60/40 tobacco/mmj spliff.”"
ript2shrds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/good-medicine/reviews/1366167,"“Great for anxiety/PTSD and spinal injuries. For me this strain is like a muscle and mind relaxer. It's not strong enough to get you super stoned, so it's perfect for long hikes or fishing trips. Personally, I like to use it as a "base layer" before adding a different strain on top, especially a strong sativa if you tend to get anxiety or anything.  The CBD takes the edge off even if you took too much of an edible and...”"

High CBD Flower with a very enjoyable long lasting stone. 

Buds are Indica Sided, Dense, Smelly 
and shaped like a cluster of grapes 
Looks like a wilted green strawberry 
Orange dust everywhere
Short orange hairs are very short but no lack of orange dust 
Smell is...pine, skunky, fuel-y, spicy, a tad earthy 
But once cracked open a burst of THC, zest, fabric softener, and...”"

MplsJackson,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/good-medicine/reviews/1336433,"“I visited Colorado hoping to find a strain like this. I suffer from anxiety, and I've found the strains with close to equal amounts of THC and CBD are most beneficial to my mental state. 

Not as tasty or euphoria-inducing as the THC heavy-hitters I tried, but also a lot more fun than popping a CBD capsule.”"

I bought some Good Medicine at the Point Loma Patient Consumer Co-op (San Diego) on the recommendation of the person who was assisting me at the co-op after I told her I was looking for a CBD rich stain, and  I'm pleased that I went with her recommendation.  This is similar to Harlequin: It's relaxing with no real euphoric head buzz, but I di...”"

However once I got the airy taste in, I figured I'd start small with one hit. Took it 6:30 pm after depression spiraled me down from on-edge to 'can't do daily life'.  So... a bit of a head-throb effect so far in terms of a head rush. By 7, felt receptive to everything around me and more interested in observing it, did dishes which this a...”"

The problem is that every time I've given it a shot the pain will get better for maybe 10 minutes and then I feel sick. I feel off, sick to my stomach and get a bad headache.
