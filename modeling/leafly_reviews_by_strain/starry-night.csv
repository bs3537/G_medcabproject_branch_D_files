Upon popping  the jar, an intense diesel odor filed the room. The tastes of blue cheese and diesel competed for territory on my tongue, while skunk and fruit wafted up the back of my throat, trickling  out through my nostrils. 
Very Potent.
The main effect of this cannabis to note is  it's antidepressant quali...”"

cashmaster2015,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starry-night/reviews/1370365,"“Nice high, great to eat on, a great stress reliever and a euphoric feeling. In the beginning I was really active I had to be up and moving around while talking to my friends I was very talkative. Afterwards I had the giggles to the max man I could not stop laughing, but right now I feel like a statue made of lead in my chair, a great couch lock I am so relaxed right now, can't wait to try this again.”"

R4r,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starry-night/reviews/1612902,"“Sativas typically heighten my anxiety and panic, but starry night was different. I did get jumpy a bit one time but several other days it's the perfect meds for my depression and retreating behavior. Gets me out of a funk or motivates me to stay focused.”"
chicagopatient,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starry-night/reviews/1619240,"“I'd give this 1000 ml tank a 6 rating if I could. PTS in IL makes this tank, and it is the first time since trying it in the summer of 2016 that it has been re-stocked. The flavor is pine, lemon, and dry fruit. The effect is very potent and sets in with only a few puffs. Stress reduction, easing of invasive thoughts, and pleasant relaxation all set in right away. It is non-drowsy, but it does cause mild appetite incr...”"
corporatesheep,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starry-night/reviews/1748304,"“pts in Illinois called this live resin a sativa. I'd say its way closer to a hybrid, indica leaning.  for my anxiety and panic attacks this strain was great. kept me focused and alert but also relaxed and not couch locked.  really excited to have this in my stock.”"

ConorG94,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/starry-night/reviews/1752230,"“The taste was amazing! I felt very high, creative, happy. It personally gave me some energy, but then after about an hour made me tired. Which was really nice for getting some last minute laundry/Netflix in right before bed.”"
