Got a qp of this (legit) and it quicky became one of my favs. I love the Sour and Haze familys, and the haze shines thru here. The batch i had smelled like berrys/plum/fruit. The smoke was a strong fruity taste similar to plum,thats over taken by the classic haze spicy/catpissy flavor at the end. The high is a strong euphoric ride that seems to last into the next day. You could be doing...”"

gurren_lynx,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sugar-plum/reviews/1380394,"“Sativa dominant hybrid. 1st Place, 2003 Oregon Medical Cannabis Award Winner. Sugar Plum is a cross between Berkeley Blues and a Hawaiian Haze Plum. The flavor is complex the deep tropical flavor of the Haze Plum comes through first with the earthy Berkeley Blues bottom note clearly coming through the finish. Always throws several large, dense colas. Stores well and finishes fast. Tasty to vape, energizing effects

Appetite is good for the first time in weeks. None of my typical cramps or nausea following meals.

Mood is wonderful. Peaceful euphoria. Very relaxed, but clear-headed.”"

hendre17,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sugar-plum/reviews/1544992,"“A perfect daytime smoke.  Nearly 100% sativa with fantastic flavors of berry tannins and musky goodness.  The terpene profile, flavor and smell of this strain reminded my wife and I immediately of Maitake mushrooms(Grifola frondosa) or hen of the woods.  Woody, oaky, berry and umame mushroom notes.  Never have I smelled or tasted such a complex bouquet from a sativa.  For instance, landrace (pure) sativa, such as reu...”"

IKnowWeed,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sugar-plum/reviews/1258338,"“Amazing floral/plum smell and taste that really comes through in concentrates.  The buds are long and skinny with a very high calyx/leaf ratio.  They look like a darker olive green and appear wet from the mostly-clear layer of trichomes.  This weed def. looks like a sativa in structure, but with a reported <40 day flowering time and very stony effects, I would expect this to be more of an indica leaning hybrid.  Wort...”"

Very cerebral, euphoric high.No drowsieness or couchlock at all. Yet it does produce a slight body high along eith the mental effects. Antsyness and anxiety were a little high at 1st, but after smoking it a few times its become one of my favorite strains”"

After sitting down felt very relaxed, and has decent chronic pain relief qualities.  Will also make you hungry and with me towards the end of the buzz euphoria set it.”"

Yes! Yes! Yes! This is a true gem 💎! Not even ten minutes in and all traces of pain are gone, complete relaxation while alert and ready to interact. It's the best combination because I have the body relaxation of an indica with the energetic alertness of a sativa. 
Definitely some body tingles and warmth here and there. I only got a gram of this at the shop and now I...”"

High lasts pretty long and keeps you held there until finally coming down into a lethargic sleepiness. Nice mellow taste but increases appetite like crazy. Overall a killer strain with great thc levels.”"

Earthy smell and sweet taste left me feeling heavy all over and behind the eyes. Great for working in a chair and Sativa nature makes it an easy one to get around on. Overall, great parent strains yield a top shelf Sativa and scores 5/5 for me. Try it out, taste is wonderful!”"
