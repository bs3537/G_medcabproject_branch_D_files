LavenderDreamz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1397072,"“This strain is wonderful!! We have it at the dispensary that I work at and it is FLYING off the shelf. 

BIG FROSTY buds with an aroma that will leaving you wanting another sniff.

I use Crater Lake in the mornings when I am trying to be productive, or if I am going out for an evening of dancing. Its energetic and clear!

Come and get it while you can!”"
CravenMorebuds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1299181,"“I could stare at this all day, buds are so perfect they are what you would get if you tried to CGI some perfect pot.

I got #4 and I am pissed I didn't get to try 1-3 :)   I hope there is a lot more #4 and more to come.
It really smokes like a haze and while it took over the mind it didn't keep me from wanting to do things.
like smoke more crater lake !! 

Its no wonder they names a national park after this strain.”"
Stossa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1360012,"“One of my favorite 50/50 hybrid strains. I first tried this in Portland a few times, then have had cuts from 2 -3 local dispensaries over the last year. I have never been disappointed. They are always nicely frosted nugs, that are perfect if you want an afternoon nap, or are looking for something to watch a movie to in the evening. It may make you very sleepy in larger doses, but does a great job of relaxing muscles,...”"

skullerymaid,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1478552,"“Crater Lake is a great afternoon, lazy morning, or camping kind of strain. At no point is it racy or speedy, but it gives you an uplifted, motivated high at first, before slowing into a Blue Dream-esque stone. Really nice, hard to find but if you do, grab some and roll a couple joints. You'll end up having a really happy, nice day. 👌”"
samsmokesweedconfirmed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1340477,"“One of my favorites. This puts you in a euphoric, productive state of mind. Great for social gatherings or really any talkative situation. This buzzy head high, is beautifully partnered with a relaxing body high. Great overall daytime strain. Just don't smoke too much or you might end up locked into the couch thinking about life for hours :)”"
quitecrafty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1218226,"“I had the Crater Lake #6 Strain. I really enjoy it. It really helps me focus and get things to done if I choose too. I usually smoke this before I have to do chores around the house. Not a super long last high, usually around 1.5-2 hours for me but I only take 2-3 hits since I don't need more than that. It starts off strong and tapers off really nicely. Definitely a favorite.”"

paigeemills,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1733062,"“Crater Lake is a citrus sweet smoke that is smooth and very cerebral. In smaller quantities it feels like a bright, creative and euphoric sativa. This is a great strain for anxiety and stress and helping induce creativity and keep you feeling productive.  In larger quantities it can make you a little hazy and feeling the need for a nap due to its heavy eye feel that sets in. All in all a nice strain, good for day tim...”"
Odra910,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1601791,"“Wow. L.O.V.E it. Feelimg real good. Happy. I definitely taked something. But my coughing fit made me forget. Feeling that weird pressure behind my eyes. And being able to see rainbow in small sitches throughout my vision. 

Sorry. Im really high right now. My throat burns. Took a hot one.”"
cuzjacky,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1225311,"“definitely a mellow high, perfect for relaxing or lazy days, would totally buy again”"
nogginfur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1340297,"“Very good stone.  Smooth light smoke and taste.  Earthy, sweet, berry taste.  Energetic, focused, and a bit of a body high too.”"
brewerlevi,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1374837,"“This strain is no doubt one of my top favorites to smoke. Very bright green buds, thick trichromes and the high is super heavy. Crater Lake dominates other top shelf buds when it comes to the quality of high you get.”"
idakidtech,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1497578,"“I love this strain and cant wait until its more popular.  The high is so clear and relaxing. I got Crater Lake in a live resin and even in high doses, .1-.2 gram dabs, you still feel extremely balanced and calm and clear and in control. i took a huge dab of it after not having smoked for 12 hours and it was just lovely. if you see this strain in your local dispensary do not hesitate to pick up an 8th or 2 ;)”"
nwcanna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/crater-lake/reviews/1636626,"“This strain blew my mind. Very similar to blue dream in taste and high. Imo crater lake is just as good if not better than blue dream. Perfectly balanced hybrid.”"
