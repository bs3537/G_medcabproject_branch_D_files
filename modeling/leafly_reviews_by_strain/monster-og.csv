Monster OG
=============
YUNGBagG421,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monster-og/reviews/1417927,"“I recently scored a few grams of Monster OG, and let me tell you all out there, this must be one of the best strains I've ever indulged in. Since i'm fairly new to the Kush Game, this strain was particularly on a higher level than my other experiences with kush. This is perfect as a nightcap (a nighttoke, if you prefer.) lots of positive effects: particularly pain relief, and munch.

Overall, a solid 4.8/5 on my list...”"
PuaManaPakalolo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monster-og/reviews/1303010,"“Monster OG is by far the most fire OG we sampled on our visit to LA. The authenticity of the SFV OG cut bred back with OG Kush can be detected as the Monster OG bomb rushes your dome with waves of healing inspiration and heavy heady Indica goodness. If you are in LA make sure you check out the true OG'z at The Green Element Collective and see for yourself what all the OG'z are blazing: Monster OG!”"

Omg, I've been out of country for a month, came back and was ready to smoke and this strain has absolutely took me there. It hits you pretty fast and if a total head and body high. Don't try to drive if you've smoke this stuff, it's intense. now that I'm home, relaxed, and comfortable I can enjoy this smooth high until I fall sleep.”"

I love this strain for sleeping, anxiety...if it's been a tough week I can smoke it on a Friday, relax for an hour or two and head to bed feeling refreshed and ready for the weekend. Also really great for PTSD and anxiety/panic attacks. I've had great medical results from the strain and highly recommend it.”"

altqueen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monster-og/reviews/1544009,"“Very couch locked, but not in a bad way. It makes you feel pretty floaty, but not at all inattentive. It's my favorite hybrid because it finds a perfect balance between the benefits of both native and indica.”"

NuminousOrphic,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/monster-og/reviews/1607943,"“Had this after a month long T break...broke the tip of the nug and rolled it into a joint, after four puffs I had to put it down and lie down staring into space into incredible relaxation and a very comfortable mind high... body went numb and slept like a baby. Beware of the munchies though, this one will knock you on your ass! A little goes a long way, definitely for more experienced smokers.”"
