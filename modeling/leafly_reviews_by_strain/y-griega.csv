Y Griega
=============
zerqain,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/y-griega/reviews/1396366,"“This medicine had brought some focus on the non linear world of why's and how's and seeing the relations between stuff-people and the planet. 

It was extraordinarily potent and distinctively deeper than any other medicine I've used. Body relaxation, but coupled with extreme clear questioning mind? that was psychedelic!

Fantastic mood improver and pain killer, highly recommended!”"
