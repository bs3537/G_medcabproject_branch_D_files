It has me thinking pleasant things, often pondering one thing for what seems like a long time. Was hoping it would help me start my day, and I'm feeling much more able to with it (great for depression!). I'm liking that it's lifted without the usual effects of a sativa for me. Great combo of comfy indica and alert sativa.”"
