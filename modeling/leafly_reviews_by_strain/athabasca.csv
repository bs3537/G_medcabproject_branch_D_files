Athabasca

LatentStoner,https://www.leafly.com/indica/athabasca/reviews/1366521,"“New Medicinal Cannabis user. Got this from my LP. 

It is good for evening strain. Balanced THC to CBD ratio. I can be functional and have no anxiety (social or internal) while on this. 

Not giving it a 5/5 because it does make me feel dizzy at those one off times.”"
