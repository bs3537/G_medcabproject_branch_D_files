I served one year in Iraq as a medic attached to an infantry unit - I've seen and done some shit. As a result, I basically have every hindrance to sleep possible.

The best flower I have ever used was a King Louis OG bud. Great head high, can induce some serious couch lock, feelings of euphoria and deep relaxation with quick drowsiness. Only downside is that you can feel pretty groggy in the AM if you smoke/vaporize later in the evening.”"
