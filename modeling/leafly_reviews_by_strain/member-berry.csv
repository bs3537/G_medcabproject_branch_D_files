IcewindTom,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/member-berry/reviews/1793525,"“Very good for lack of appetite. I get the munchies like crazy. Nice relaxing buzz, but not sleepy. No anxiousness or paranoia. Tastes spicy and citrus grapefruit. I am vaping the G Pen Cart from MUV Dispensary in Florida.”"

Mr_Limonene,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/member-berry/reviews/1807399,"“Got this at Truelieve as TruFlower pods. Buds smell of berries with a background hint of diesel which are bright green and speckled with purple. Smoke is smooth and tastes of blueberry muffins/cobbler. So tasty! High is very pleasant and long lasting. A little bit of energy to start then mellows out nicely. Not overpowering, but not a lightweight either.”"
