The nugs are really dense and break up to a nice amount but my favorite part is the high it gives a nice mental/physical relaxation. If you havent tried it i recommend you pick this 1 up and see for yourself. #🔥”"

I'm a light weight but one puff had me instantly high and feeling nice.. Fell asleep with a smile on my face after a while.”"
