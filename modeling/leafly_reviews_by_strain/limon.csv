The name is Limon, but that doesn't quite describe how it smells. It actually smells like someone chucked a barrel of limes into a barrel of diesel and let them absorb. It's pungent and tart. The s...”"

Romulankrank,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/limon/reviews/1291348,"“Limon is a great daytime choice for patients looking for relief from pain and stress. Very uplifting Sativa buzz that will inspire and motivate. Livwell did very well here :) The plants lineage influences the flavor quite well with notes of tart lemons,strawberries, diesel. Novice smokers use caution with this high THC strain with average testing showing levels of 24.5% THC. Drop by Livwell today and try it yourself”"

funkmasterphlex,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/limon/reviews/1297805,"“Pretty invigorating. Taste is very lemony and I got an instant head buzz. Gave me a lot of pressure behind the eyes but it was nice. Had a nice euphoria for ten minutes, then mellowed into a introspective heady feel. Wanted to go skate but was content with playing gamecube. Lasted slightly longer than other strains I get. No down side for me what so ever.”"

paulpex,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/limon/reviews/1598044,"“Very nice taste and uplifting. But it is better mixed with tobacco or another strain if you prefer a soft high and not much anxiety. You will be ready to enjoy a sunny day or a party night. I used in vacation and I always mixed with some another stuff to boost it.”"
