Holy Grail Kush

weazal,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/holy-grail-kush/reviews/1416486,"“Immediately after smoking you can feel how high-quality it is. Extremely pleasure inducing - both mentally and physically. It really makes you feel GOOD! There's a sizzling all over your body that's tantalizing along with an awesomely encouraging thrill in your chest. The indica element brings a noticeable depth, distant headspace, and tangible weight on the top of your head - but it's never overbearing and always pl...”"
SomeguyAZ,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/holy-grail-kush/reviews/1394796,"“The medication works most effectively in almost completely eliminating pain and nausea associated with a migraine. Making anything left so much more tolerable.

The flavor and odor are the best I've tried so far. It literally tasted like the smell of freshly cut yard after rain, which happened to be located next to a pine forest.”"
chrononaut,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/holy-grail-kush/reviews/1416485,"“Great Hybrid alternative for a daytime Indica smoker who needs a strain that has a non couchlock effect.

Or in turn for a 24/7 Sativa smoker who needs a good strain for body and mood, but not the head fog.

Long lasting effect 2-3, non groggy finish.

Flavors-sweet apricot, pungent earth tones

Tender's notes: Have a tasty beverage handy to combat dry mouth !”"

Had my first bowl of it today. Hit it of my HvyGlass Bong and i nearly lost my hit i choked so hard. Potent Strain. Instant numbing in brain with no pain at all. Has a headband feel in the head. Very euphoric and chill, focused, alert and warm as ever.”"

I've had this hanging about for a little while. I'm not sure why. It's quite nice. the taste is like lemon pepper and frankincense.
