I would advice vaping it, tasted better and affected me for much longer compared to the first time I smoked it via pipe. This strain will make you super productive. If you're thinking about cleaning the house all day with great energy and enthusiasm, light this motherfucker up!”"

Back in the mid 1970's, high powered thc bearing sensimilla strains were not commonly available in the US. One of the strains that changed this was Hawaiian. Morning Glory reminds me alot of Hawaiian from this era. I think this sample i got  must have tested 17 % THC,- hardly chronic! but the taste and effect are very simillar to what we u...”"

Among friends, this strain provides a chill high, comfortfable leaning back, great for having a relaxed conversation while playing games with friend and having a laugh.

It's one of my go-to strains for unwinding after a long day at work, when I'm not quite ready to go to bed yet. It can be difficult to locate. Not in every shop, but not super rare either.”"
KWGriff,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/morning-glory/reviews/1802725,"“Another great strain, made me feel very relaxed and calm. Had a nice citrus, pepper taste to it. It is a total stress destroyer. The high for me was a bit heady, but still manageable and later it worked into a nice mellow relaxing body high. Made me want to take a nap and I slept blissfully. I like it.”"
