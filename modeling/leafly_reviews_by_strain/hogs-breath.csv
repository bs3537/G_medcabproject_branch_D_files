Hog's Breath
=============
MarijuaNaut,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1398895,"“I'll give this stuff somewhere between an 8.5 and a 9. 

When I heard we were picking some up two days ago, my initial reaction was a mix between curiosity and skepticism. I had never heard of 'Hog's Breath' before, and I didn't really get a, "Wow, that sounds awesome!", sensation from the name. Nonetheless, when it arrived, we loaded up the standard glass pipes, smoked a good three or four hits....and, slowly real...”"
LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1372534,"“This has been a Top favorite Indica since it was intoduced to me back in 06'. This is a very Pungent smelling Indica that will easily lay you out. Very narcotic stone, great for insomnia and pain. Highly recommended!”"
desybear13,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1343648,"“i bought just some shake of this strain and i have been sick with the flu for nearly a week not being able to eat a single meal. when i tried this, i finally was able to build up an appetite and not feel nauseous. i know i will be able to eat a full meal tonight and not feel so fatigued in the morning :) definitely recommend!!!”"
LiddleMarky,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1389531,"“Bought a half O of this and I must say the high is a phenomenal experience. So peaceful and a total knock out. Satisfy your munchies and find a place to chill. I recommend hot boxing with a couple J's. You'll know it's good when you feel the punch.”"

Lunarjane,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1398998,"“I just tried Hogs Breath in a preroll. It's 3:30 am and I wanted to get back to sleep. I feel so relaxed and calm, I'd like to stay up a bit and enjoy this because it's so rare with PTSD to feel this way. I gave it 5 stars because it's made me feel the least amount of fight or flight anxiety I've had in awhile. Thank you to the Swine God, bless you 🐖🐖🐖”"
jnastyx420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1372535,"“Dude, this shit will kick your ass. 

I took a couple hits from this bong shaped bubbler, and felt the effects almost instantly.  I was stuck on the couch in the den area, all the lights were cut off, my family had on Life of Pi. Watching while faded blew my mind. After the movie I consumed a large amount of rocky road ice and red velvet cake. Anyways this is some powerful/magical shit.”"
XoraKJoken,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1360737,"“Overall a very pleasant strain. The quarter I picked up of it seemed very well grown for the level of grow available, though I would like to see it grown in a more advanced setup. Onto the buds; the sharp smell is enticing to say the least. Upon smoking I found relaxing yet uplifting high very akin the Buddha's Sister. Great for smoking with friends, not the best pain relief. Would recommend to recreational smokers /...”"

AndoranGambler,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1070413,"“Bizarrely named, but easily one of the heaviest creative stones I have experienced recently.  Great scents, dense nugs, overall a great smoke.”"
JackDanieL,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1070403,"“The nug stinks, the smoke stinks, you stink -- its Hog's Breath!  Certainly one of the most aptly named strains I've come across, though not necessarily one of my favorites.  It did win the Cannabis Cup and it is a pretty looking Hindu Kush who had a one night stand with some Afghani, and I love a love story, but the jar I got didn't win me over.  I've heard that when its right, it can be the business - so I hope to ...”"

MedicalGod,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1358218,"“I personally like this strain because it's calms down my pain on my joints in my hand and I can go out with friends and be socials and talk a lot and it makes them laugh and it makes me laugh so I'd recommend this strain of you have social anxiety and it even works if you have pain it just puts you in a calm and relaxed mood and u just start talking and get creative. This strain is 4/5”"
persian503,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1398989,"“An unbridled symphony of linalool and caryophyllene thunder in your mouth as you vaporize this savory herb.  She hits hard and is pleasing with clove and vanilla floral notes.  Hog's Breath is incredibly satisfying.”"
mrduespaid,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1399001,"“Total sleeper strain. It tastes very much like moss... it's an odd, earthy, but yet smooth and consistent flavor. After a nice J, I was faded. It's got a nice kick on the backend. I would have rated higher but the flavor is boring and plentiful.”"

We got some sent to us and Oh My God it had a very Pungent Aroma that filled the entire room just from a small amount. The taste was just like it smelled so you know it's some kill.

Backed off the next time it was pretty incredible. Felt like the hair on my head was standing straight up. Took care of a bad tension headache. A must try. Maybe a bit too much for the likes of me, though.”"

I smoke a lot of weed. lately been smoking platinum Girl Scout cookies and OG Kush but I mixed it up and got an indica today and I must say this high is relaxing and for winding down. OG Kush is for wake n bake. enuf said Hogs breath is one good strain. I'm ready for a movie bowl of ice cream and cloud 9.”"
itsBlackMorris,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hogs-breath/reviews/1398973,"“I love this strain. A lot of people don't care for it and that's understandable. Its has a peculiar stench and is definitely an acquired taste. Sweet, musky, and porky.  You will reek of it after you smoke. Don't get in a car with someone without breath mints. I do however find it to be a very energetic and creative high. Good for working on artsy projects in the daytime.  It'd be nice at a barbecue ironically. It ma...”"

I'm rocking out to music and thinking of sex and stuff to happily ride it out.

Definite hints of purple with medium-heavy thrichroming on the outside.
