Romulan
=============
Brian,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1412730,"‚ÄúThe Rom dropped a bomb on my head. Not the smartest idea to take my portable vaporizer loaded up with this particular strain to a bowling alley. Needless to say, I quickly lost interest in the repetitiveness of throwing a heavy ball down a strip of greased flooring. It was one of those midnight bowling situations where they turn the lights down...I simply felt the need to just put on my sunglasses anyway and observe ...‚Äù"
MellowSailor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1413562,"‚ÄúI am pretty picky in what strains I medicate with and have tried all kinds, but Romulan is one of my all-time favorites.   I am very specific in the effects I want to feel. I need cannabis to 1) Calm my stomach/intestines immediately and take away nausea - and - 2) Provide me with a mellow, manageable high that does NOT induce paranoia or anxiety.  I have severe IBS, GERD and a host of other intestinal issues, so a h...‚Äù"

Romulan. There is a slight spicy, peppery aroma.

Arminite,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1418563,"‚ÄúA strong body high, with high couchlock, perfect for pain, anxiety, and insomnia. Makes me feel like someone is massaging my muscles from within my body; sometimes it feels like there is electricity tingling down my limbs. Very effective for my chronic shoulder and neck pain. The pain is transformed into a sensation of heat that is not nearly as bothersome. My favorite effect Romulan has is that it intensifies audito...‚Äù"
yondeezy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1383390,"‚ÄúI got a free sample from Medithrive a while back and decided to finally try it out. I'm not much of an Indica person so I didn't know what to expect....DAYAMM!!!

To put it simply, when you smoke it, you're in a battle with gravity and you will NOT win, so don't bother trying to fight it. When I stood up I just immediately sat back down because my body was jello. Once I laid down in my bed, it felt like I was float...‚Äù"
Defro81,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1418564,"‚ÄúI have horrible nerve pain in my legs from a spinal injury. This strain takes that pain away within minutes. I have let a few of my friends who also have nerve pain, they have all had the same results. If you suffer from nerve pain issues, this stuff works miracles.‚Äù"
jessi.chval,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1373062,"‚ÄúThis standard of excellence, against which I measure all other indicas, is my go-to pain reliever. Romulan melts my face. Every time. Night time use only, unless I have a migraine or cramps. I have been smoking this strain for so long that I can tell by smell when anything else I get has been crossed with it.‚Äù"
organicsarcasm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1384023,"‚ÄúIMHO, this is a strain made just for me by the ganja gods. They smiled down upon me and blessed me with this legendary Canadian strain. It does exactly what I want it to, obliterates my pain, keeps me super mellow, and knocks me out at the end of the day. I've been waiting years for it to come around my source and I cannot be happier about it.‚Äù"
Heath,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1383392,"‚Äúromulan is my absolute high...  just took 4 hits after a long day at work ... ahhhahhh relaxation, stress rolls right off kinda getting a little hungry.  mainly for me is a very relaxing "weew" kind of feeling that nothing else can beat !  I rate it at a 15 !  ;O)‚Äù"
Mickey77,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1370107,"‚ÄúLOVE!!!!!! It's a great indica. Helps me sleep, relieves my pain and gives me an appetite. I use this along with their Rick Simpson Oil to treat severe muscle spasms and nerve pain from MS, RA and brain disorder, epilepsy. I feel better than ever! I'm able to get out and enjoy life again. :) Oregon Medigreen has me feeling great!‚Äù"
CMPhealing,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1393438,"‚ÄúSuper easy, mellow high. As one of the other reviewers said, it feels like you're wrapped in a blanket of pain relief. It does wonders for my mobility and fine motor skill issues caused by Parkinson's.‚Äù"
batman_420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1368784,"‚ÄúIt's some good shit. Puts ya right to sleep at night. Nice and relaxing. with the right music you can have a fantastic time.‚Äù"
DancerDJ,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1382758,"‚ÄúRomulan: happy, anti-anxiety, relaxed; I use this one after, or to curb, an anxiety attack as it makes me happy and calm without the jittery stimulants i sometimes experience from a hybrid, or sativa is worse for making my anxiety sensations worse, if I'm already in an anxiety-triggered state. Rom is a my default strain for evening relaxing or for alleviating anxiety.‚Äù"
friendlykrueger,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1374731,"‚ÄúThis is hands down my favorite indica strain at the moment. I've had multiple examples from different growers and they have all been exceptional. Aroma has varied from cherry candy to concord grapes. Definitely some amber notes too. Once smoked, the flavor always leans cherry candy for me. Normally I'm more into hashy, dieselly, cheesey smelling strains, but Romulan pushed me out of my normal pattern. For me, the hig...‚Äù"
Dabmas721,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1363234,"‚ÄúThis is some pretty good weed. It begins by existing in fucking beautiful little frosted nuggets that smell absolutely delightful. They smoke extremely well and taste wonderful. It hits really hard, but it's not at all of a debilitating high. You'll feel curious and as if things are breathing at you. Taking a walk is orgasmic. This is also perfect for a pre-sleep toke. If you lay down you'll slip into comfort heaven....‚Äù"

thezorg,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1382757,"‚ÄúStrong couch-lock effect.  Very nice for sleep.  Probably also for pain, in the sense that you really wouldn't care about the pain even if you were still aware of it.‚Äù"
FlowerPower_,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1410833,"‚ÄúReal Romulan is an incredible strain, if you can find it! Here's how you can tell- The Taste : very piney/lime(NOT LEMON,) skunky, with a very distinct  GRAPE WINE aftertaste on exhale. If you don't taste all of these things - it is not real Romulan.  The  high is both cerebral and body at the same time, with a calming effect of no other strain except Columbian Gold. This is in fact due to the actual COLUMBIAN GOLD g...‚Äù"
WhiteCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1236174,"‚ÄúI simply can't express how much this strain helped me. While filling my bowl I was suffering from some severe shoulder pain that was stressing me out and in turn creating a fair amount of insomnia but this beauty melted it all away.  The high came on surprisingly quickly and conitued to rise for around half an hour before sedating me and leaving my mind in a blissful, although forgetful, state.  Romulan has become on...‚Äù"

TimeTraveller,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1363647,"‚ÄúThe flavor profile for this strain is spot-on! The moment you inhale, a rush of earthy pine pleasantly surprises the taste buds, and the moment you exhale, a woody, almost campfire-smelling, aroma engulfs the senses. As for Romulan's effect, it's very mellow, very relaxing, very calming. Great for anxiety, stress, muscle pain, and insomnia. Along with Afgooey, this is one of my all-time favorite strains. Perfect for ...‚Äù"
HIM916,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1410730,"‚ÄúLooking for an intense total-body pain relief experience, then Romulan is what you're looking for.

PuddingShots,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1103934,"‚ÄúMy favorite. If you want to sleep, Romulan is for you. Several times after partaking, I've passed out at 8pm then awake at 10, having no idea where those 14 hours went. Very relaxing when used sparingly.‚Äù"
volcomliberation,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1103893,"‚ÄúThis was the most intense high I've ever experienced. I smoked two big bowls and I was in another dimension. I was so spaced out I didn't even know where I was (I was on my couch in my apartment playing Gears of War 3 with a friend). It has a great smell to it, piney, yet sweet. The smoke isn't pungent, and the smell goes away pretty quickly. As my high progressed, I noticed I was able to focus very intensely for 5-1...‚Äù"
BubbaliciousBaker,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1193608,"‚ÄúA strong creeper strain very effective for pain management. I would also definitely recommend Romulan for anyone needing a little help getting to sleep at night.‚Äù"

DO NOT LET THE DESCRIPTION ON THIS PAGE FOOL YOU. I've smoked this strain a few times and every time I end up saying: 'why didn't I just get purple kush or something?'‚Äù"
joAmo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1310536,"‚ÄúThis is sure to live up to its name. As described above for Romulan, this turns out to weigh heavier per nug for a given reason. More dense, compacted and sure to attract the naked eye. This strain provides the couch kickoff several hours even if you do decided to move and run errands. This still needs up giving you the true feeling of indica rather than sativa.‚Äù"

Smell and taste is sweet and potent. The smoke has the lingering quality of incense.

Bought a quarter of Romulan 5 days ago.
4 of the past 5 days I have woken up sitting on my couch with a half full bong in my lap. 
Those who claim " no couch lock!" must have higher tolerances than this 30 year weed smoker.‚Äù"

ObiJohnKenobi,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1244546,"‚ÄúSeriously great strain. It's definitely an indica strain, but does have a very mild sativa touch to it. I just smoked a little over a bowl in a small pipe and I feel amazing. Music sounds amazing on this strain to me. Eyes a little heavy. Honestly might be my favorite strain just because of how strong the indica is but it doesn't knock me out, but if I want to sleep it's easy.‚Äù"

SpraynardKruger1,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1103885,"‚ÄúSmoked this one evening with a few friends. High is a tad subtle, but gives you a very nice mellowed out feeling, and everything kind of "glows". Not exactly a "knock you on your ass" strain but still decent. Didn't last too long though. Unfortunately, the mellowness was followed by a wave of paranoia. Other than that it is an alright strain.‚Äù"

Snoozletoesx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1103918,"‚ÄúRomulan is in my opinion, is one of the more over hyped buds  I have seen (since Pineapple Express & Purple Haze). The high is okay, but its only feels a little bit better than smoking blunts of big bud (and we all know the quality of big bud). I am not a huge organic fan, but I can typically always find some better, and longer lasting organic for half the price of Romulan.‚Äù"
