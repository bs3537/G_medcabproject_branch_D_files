=============
Vash92,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/brainstorm-haze/reviews/1385580,"“Its a very clearheaded high... Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy a clear headed high, but this high is soo clear that you almost dont even feel high. 

It does put you in a good mood, once again... VERY functional. You can wake and bake with this strain, put some eye drops in, and function just fine at school or work. 

Strain is also a creeper, takes at least 10 min to feel it.”"
jpinheiro93,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/brainstorm-haze/reviews/1349039,"“A pure Thai Haze mother fertilized by their Stargazer (Sensi Star x Warlock x AK-47) produces pot that feels almost electric, with a distinct Hazy flavor and heart-racing power that makes you want to get outside and complete some tasks—a wonderful daytime weed. Great haze test with a soaring high that won't keep you up at night.”"

I did enjoy the high, very giggly. I couldn't stop laughing. There was definitely some degree of euphoria present, also somewhat relaxing. But the duration was very, very short, only three or so hours. All in all, 8.3/10, would smoke again (actually about to smoke some more).”"

RBMarshall,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/brainstorm-haze/reviews/1081953,"“Very decent sativa, great for creativity and staying alert and focused. This is a great wake and bake as it doesn't tire you out and gives you a nice calm happy feeling.

I wouldn't however recommend smoking this before bed because it can keep you awake and wanting to do things.”"

BSH is Northern lights#5 X Haze... you can NEVER go wrong with a Strain if it has pure sativa Haze crossesd in it. This is pretty much the same thing as silver haze. 🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿 5 out 5 tress!

SinnerD,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/brainstorm-haze/reviews/1178689,"“I grew this strain from seed. It is unlike any sativa dominant strain that I have grown in the past year (this year being my first as a grower). I consider it a very body dominant "buzz". It doesn't slow my energy or focus on work or any other tasks at hand. Brainstorm doesn't last all day, but it will last a good 2-3 hours after smoking a cig/joint, or a few good bong rips.  I consider this strain to be a bit of a c...”"

matti_matrix,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/brainstorm-haze/reviews/1416515,"“THC: 20% CBD: 0%

Appearance: Medium green, lots of red hairs and crystals.

Smell: Distinct "haze" smell, appealing

Taste: Not nearly as sweet and tasty as SLH. But not offensive either. A little sweet, slightly cough inducing.

Effects: Very mild initial high considering the THC content. Good, cerebral high, very low paranoia.

Down: Easy comedown, no real headache or anxiety. Decent product.”"

Pair with a nice box of Lucky Charms.”"
