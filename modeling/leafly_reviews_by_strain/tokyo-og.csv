rdjacobs30,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tokyo-og/reviews/1416643,"“This is a beautiful OG hybrid, indica dominant female. Her smell alone will knock you on your ass. The taste is a frosty og with a subtle bite to the burn but not as sharp As some SFV  can be. A very dense smoke and quite the lung filler. Two hits from a glass pipe and the room is full of smoke and it's couch lock city for 2 hours plus. This strain is a SoCal dispensarie's riserva Pravda and it's always tested above ...”"

I personally wouldn't use this during the day unless I was stuck at home and had nothing to do but watch tv.  If you are in need of something to help you sleep like a baby, I would recommend this strain!  It works for me.”"

LeroyBrown420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tokyo-og/reviews/1246011,"“One of those few strains that tastes as good, if not better than it smells. Fruity Pebbles comes to mind when ground and that exact flavor profile lingers in your mouth after exhausted. Somewhat mind amusing, Indica heavy full body chill that will slow you down and quite possibly put you in the mood. 100% date night recommended. Daytime use could case a loss of production. Terpene hunters take note, this sugars a wet...”"

The sight, smell, taste, effect...everything about this beautiful flower is top-notch! You can feel the love that's put in to making it the effective medicine it is the first time you experience it.

I had no idea what to expect the first time around so I only picked up a gram (but wished after that I didn't ) so I went back and picked up more the next day! Great for a nice relaxing body buzz that helps with the pain... without too much of the sedation. Tiny hints of pine and lemon make it almost minty.”"
