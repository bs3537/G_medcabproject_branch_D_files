After hitting this potent blossom flower. 
I only smoke flower, this was by far one of
My favorite plants. And I been smoking before some of you knew who Snoop Dogg was.”"
Wickedbark59,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookies-and-dream/reviews/1313014,"“Officially my new favorite! Takes care of pain and nausea while keeping you alert and fully functioning. There's a euphoria that comes along with it too. It doesn't prevent me from sleeping like some other daytime strains which I love.”"

Very apparent in the head, yet relaxing in the body without couch-lock symptoms at all. Giggly waves were altered with hungry waves, but I've felt happy throughout the experience. 

What's more is that the next day, I was amazingly motivated to fix things around the house and I had a ton of energy as well. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on this spectacular stra...”"

I have to say it was a very nice change. Had a nice uplifted feeling for a while before gently relaxing into one of my favorite books for a bit... Then off to dream”"

Baltimore, MD. 26-29% the and 2% terps so 28-31% pure medicine.  among the best buds I have ever tasted via smoke or vape, totally delicious and energizing and uplifting, definitely a new fave strain. highly recommended daytime strain, but also okay at night due to pure thc content enough of this will knock anyone out. can absolutely feel the first hit. this was properly grown and flush...”"

I only felt it mildly in my body but had a good head high, nice and euphoric. not my favorite variation of girlscout cookies but still great! this strain has a faint hint of blueberry and burned nicely but smoke production was a bit less than average with a bit more itch in your throat. I smoked it a few days...”"

riff610,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookies-and-dream/reviews/1646615,"“Not a bad strain, but doesn't do much for me as far as being an exotic sativa.  I think that i have a batch that has around average potency and the bud structure is very small.  A lot of popcorn buds in an oz of Dream Cookies.  Rather decent on the bud density, but like Green Crack a lighter hot burning plant.  Overall effects act a bit confusing, not enough in your head to make your heart flutter from anxiety, but t...”"

If you take a huge pipe or bong rip you will feel droopy, sometimes think really fast and find yourself zoning out and questioning small things. Not the full body high I wanted but it was definately auto pilot for my neck and up.”"
RaisingCains,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookies-and-dream/reviews/1672508,"“This being my first experience in a long time and only the fourth time I've smoked, this hit me pretty hard. It started with a very strong head high with lots of energy. I also felt some numbness in my lips. After about an hour it became very trippy. I actually felt like I kept wake up from a dream and could not tell if my memories were real or a dream. Like I was stuck looping in and out of a time warp. I had to kee...”"

The awesome agent recommended this to me- I needed something to keep me up and motivated since I work three jobs lol- This strain gives clarity, a serious energy boost and euphoria that had me laughing and smiling.
