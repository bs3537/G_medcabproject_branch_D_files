LeroyBrown420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/platinum-wreck/reviews/1240570,"“Most cultivators will admit that mastering the cure is much harder than growing a weed. With that being said, my sample was not cured to my plate. Smelled mostly like hay and had a powdery crumble when ground. I liked my P-Wreck effects just fine. Clear minded Sativa feeling medicine. Was not harsh when smoked and there was no visual burned or dead leafs. Under the alfalfa mask I did found citrus & pine, explaining t...”"
