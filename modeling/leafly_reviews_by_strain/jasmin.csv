It felt like a warm heavy blanket and left me couch locked and giggly. I love mixing strains and have had a lot of fun pairing Jasmine with other indicas for an even heavier effect.

I enjoyed the smell before I I put the crumble in the vaporizer. In the first inhale, ( even the weed taste like eating garden plants) gives a cool relaxing feeling. It also tastes sweet and smells likes flowers after vaping the weed.”"

Midnight_Moan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jasmin/reviews/1698936,"“Wow! This is hands down the best [indica-dominant] strain I've had. I anticipated the normal head high and a bowl later, I felt my body essentially melt into relaxation mode. I hit the couch and couldn't move. 

When the immobilization period ended after about 30 minutes, I was still happy, giddy and very much stonered. Not much for munchies, which I didn't mind, but I couldn't fake sobriety after hitting this.

It is apparently Durban Poison and Super Silver Haze, making it come down on the Sativa side of the spectrum. The buds are shaped like SSH, kind of like an arrowhead.
