This is a veteran strain fer sure. If you need to be knocked out be pre-paired to be couch locked. Ultra top shelf nugs, these dank nuggeteers pack a powerful punch since blue power is crossed with this strain its incredibly heavy. Dry eyes more than mouth, but mega chill and social. Absolut...”"

This triggered back pain and muscle spasms from trying to catch it and lift it back upright without dumping all the contents. Sin mint cookies is sort of sweet with a mix of earthy pine and mint. It had sticky green buds with lots of orange. Nice smooth mild hits from an ice bon...”"

EdnaF,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sinmint-cookies/reviews/1565198,"“I picked this up because of its consensus effects on pain and inflammation. I was not disappointed. I have severe osteoarthritis. Inflammation and sharp stabbing pains are a fact of life. This strain has proven to be a big help. It's not a daytime strain for active outdoor activities. It's a settle back in the evening, slip into restful sleep strain. It's not mind-clouding. It's more about letting go of stress and st...”"
CaliQt94,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sinmint-cookies/reviews/1398640,"“OMG! I have excruciating cramps, but 1 toke of SinMint Cookies and I am crampfree & floating on top of the world. I've been unfortunately been popping Motrins all day and they did nothing! I also want to thank the young lady who helped me.

monstapuss,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sinmint-cookies/reviews/1398645,"“Damn!  Just grabbed a 1g pre-roll from Green Pharms in Mesa, AZ.  Was expecting the typical pre-roll mediocrity of many other places.  This was divine! Only smoked 1/2, and still feeling fantastic after 2.5 hours.  Knocks me into the couch, takes away all anxiety, made me hungry about 30 min after smoking & could sleep, but don't HAVE to. 

This is a keeper!”"

Stuwan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sinmint-cookies/reviews/1441484,"“This one is worth trying. To my picky surprise it is quite good. I'm handicapped and can't do the light weight bud.

ahrenberger25,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sinmint-cookies/reviews/1371116,"“A delightful twist on our fave GSCs. Same potency with an opiate-like initial rush, which plateaus for a little while before a creeper 2nd wave completely knocks the crap out of any bummer day! Great meds for depression, stress and social anxiety... Or overdo it a little to fall asleep quick!”"

A dank and earthy aroma that’s slightly sweet. Very tasty and smooth smoke and makes a great slow-burning sessioner. A very solid stone with a good amount of couch lock and body relaxation and slight euphoria and mind stimulation.”"

I can taste a little hint of mint but it doesn't give me that cool feeling mint does. This strain does feel like a indica. Something that can put me to sleep.”"

This strain made me happy & relaxed followed by complete euphoria! Buds were dense & pine coned shaped. Buds looked lighter in color then they were because they were covered in frosty trichomes. Light orange hairs were few across the bud. Smell was a sweet nutty spearmint with the taste about the same. Reminded me of Wrig...”"
CaptKirkWA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/sinmint-cookies/reviews/1713251,"“Super raw rosin! It smells so good and terpy of gas, earthy, skunk. That pungent smell I like. I'm a gassy/ diesel type of person. Great strain. Definitely a couch locker.

Another mellow high with a little body heaviness but not that strong, I could move around fine without going into a couch lock. However, I wouldn't use it if you have something to do.

California owners I would imagine, giving tourist weed at top shelf prices, playing their games here! Strain's so good it gets 4/5 even with the prices in Las Vegas!”"
