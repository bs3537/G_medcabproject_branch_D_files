DrHunterThompson,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1361091,"“Amazing strain. As a college student I really appreciate the fact that I can go to class medicated a function fine.”"
reyashtoos,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1320820,"“Possibly the most balanced high I've ever had -- equal part head and body high.  I would sometimes mix my sativas with my indicas to try and strike a balance.  Luckily, this strain saves me the trouble of doing the work :-)   The body high is pure relaxation with a touch of tingle, not couch-locked.  The head high is sexy and happy without being over stimulating, so it doesn't lead to anxiety.  If Silver Kush were a ...”"

I really like how  Silver Kush nugs are nice and dense, it being a Sativa I wouldn't expect it. However, the silver kush I have looks more of an indica than sativa, although  ( looks can be deceiving) so it will be a mystery until she's done and ready to be smoked. I made about 10 clones, they all survived. I was so successful with cloning and now I have t...”"

Look: different blend of dark and light nugs, coverd in crystals, a little stickier then I had hoped... 8.5/10
Taste: smooth with earthy notes, easy on the throat.... 9.5/10
Happy feel good time: very much a sativa, motivated, de stressed, focused and driven. Go do somthing!! 9.5/10
Overall: good stuff to wake and bake and handle the halftime in the day when you get a little sore...”"
BJWB,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1543578,"“Confession of a Lightweight: SK delivers a smooth high of modest power: a cerebral-orientated trip that will get one engrossed in an activity. It packs a punch though, and if one overdoes it they may experience a sense of déjà vu and some anxiety. It’s a great strain for getting high and partying with friends, or even having a romantic night in.”"
FawnNWildlife,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1493815,"“Was very very useful when it came to panic attacks, paranoia and bouts of depression. It got me up on my feet cleaning, baking, and also relaxing when i needed it most and helped get naps in which are unheard of. Super thankful for this yummy treasure”"
VJvalvenus420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1225740,"“SK has a great piney taste. It's dense nugs and potent smell make u wanna go back for more. I would gladly smoke this strain...With my friends too!   ♡♡♡&Peace....”"
VJvalvenus420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1311479,"“She's ready after her cure. I smoked a Raw Cone last night and it was fire. The smell is sweet  but yet earthy. The high lingers on you for a few hours so be careful when consuming this strain. This plant is fun to grow, and very easy with minimal issues at hand. once you've dialed her in, the rest is a piece of cake. I hope this review helped. Love&Peace  #420educateDontH8 #WomenWhoGrow”"
Mulch,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1317059,"“Probably one of the densest tri-chrome covered strains I've encountered...Also, a favorite wake n bake strain and w/ it's genetic background, it's a safe bet. But kush fans take note this is a serious sativa dom. kush that will show its true colors quick.  Great fruity gum and minty smell n taste. Noobs take care or steer clear this lady doesn't mess arnd!

deadport,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1502078,"“This strain has the least tendency of developing paranoia that I've ever tried. Even though it should be sativa I was quite 'hypnotised' by it. It has a relaxing and happy high to it.. great for ADHD.”"
MickMegquier,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1277350,"“Flavor:
The first few hits are very flavorful, maybe too much so, a very piney taste, with menthol and citrus undertones when vaped at lower temperatures. Sense it's 60 or 70% sativa this flavor is very sweet. It makes the room smell kinda nice. 

Effects:
Head based high. Very away and hyper focused. No chest rushes. Relaxing with a whole body sinking/tingling feeling. 

Pros/uses: Great day time high. Awake, strong...”"
hitis,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1371673,"“Very happy with the high from this. Very fun and bubbly and it's great for social or solo use. Only complaint I have about it is that the taste is pretty bad compared other strains I've smoked. I have to chew gum whenever I smoke to cover up the nasty flavor. Other than that though, definitely would recommend.”"
WisdomFarmer,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1306392,"“Silver Kush is lovely relaxing day time strain for when you have to be physically active and stay functional. The taste is enjoyable and complex with mixed floral flavors and a creamy full bodied smoke. Expect a delayed creeper Sativa head high that takes time before you'll become fully medicated.”"

Couldnt stop giggling, the flavor was such a surprise,  it taste like mint, without being menthol or heartburny.  Completely different than GSC but so unique.

kel2pf,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1311604,"“(Super silver haze/kush hybrid) Absolute favorite sativa strain! Great for daytime use, creativity, super clean and "clear". And by clean & clear, I mean it gives you energy, and whatnot, but no "anxiety" type feeling, not jittery, helps focus, and although it is an "upper" type strain, you can still sleep fine while on this, (without it keeping you up). Quite easy on the lungs as well. Definitely my favorite choice ...”"

I normally 'overdose' pretty quickly on sativa strains, that make my thoughts race, which isn't comfortable. But this was something different. Well balanced mild cerebral buzz and body high, you realize that life is gooood and colorful, music sounds so goood making you bounce to that shit, everything mellows out, sit back rel...”"

Fatalphenom,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1265649,"“This is my favorite by far. There is a pheno that leans heavily toward the OG #18 structure and bud development, creating an almost lemony aroma with a spiced-earthy undertone. Amazing effect that does not leave you on the couch. This strain is a staple in my garden. If you start from seed you will be very happy with the reward at harvest time.”"

Marihuanamike,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/silver-kush/reviews/1344648,"“This is so straight sativa I had a hard time realizing I was high. I used to think I was a huge sativa fan but this doesn't go below your shoulders, and even in the head its soooo light . High isn't short or super long. Hunger pangs but not a huge appetite. Super DENSE. Very crystaly. Light semi dank scent. Light green color”"
