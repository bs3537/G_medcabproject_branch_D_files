King Kong
=============
Peppermint,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/king-kong/reviews/1396313,"“I got a strain called just Kong from local dispensary and wow it was a fantastic body high.  I vaporized a nice bowl after waking up in the middle of the night and struggling to fall back asleep.  It gave me such a warm relaxed sense of well-being and I fell into a timeless time-warp state after that.  Very nice strain that I'll put on my favorites now for sure.”"

Very Very potent and intense high. Sour smell and the high lasts forever (actually !!!) Top 3 strain for stress, pain anxiety. If you are looking to get munchies from this strain, you will eat like king kong ! Ate so much, felt like I had a black hole in my stomach. I can't smoke it too often but would never say no...”"

The buds are nice small nuggets covered in frost and dark orange hairs.  My budtender made sure all the small lumber was taken off and  all I was left with was nice beautiful green nuggets- all top shelf smoke.

Creativity coming on.  

In all my reviews, I have only given 5-stars (4.6) a few times, This one really is five stars. Pain relief (on a very tough day!) was almost instant, and 5 minutes later I realized how high I was. My thinking was clear, I was euphoric, alert and creative, but no more energetic than usual. My one and only complaint is it did not last very long. Warning- j...”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/king-kong/reviews/1491329,"“*This IS NOT the same as the Kong strain*
 Kong is Motavation & White Russian, while King Kong is Chronic & ERSB.

Form: Crumble
THC: 71%
Brand: Canamo .5g

-I got a half gram of this in crumble, the smell is  fire, it's the way you'd expect Chronic to smell.
it's having a very sedating effect on me it's wonderful for my back pain.”"

onerebelbuddha,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/king-kong/reviews/1181942,"“I hit the chillum with the mighty King Kong packed nicely. It was slow to come on, but when it did I stood for 3 hours while watching The Wolf Of Wall Street. I don't know if I was standing because I was energized or because I didn't want to fall asleep. But it is a heavy high with a solid embrace between the temple.”"
swissin40,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/king-kong/reviews/1376105,"“This is very good. the high last strong the comedown can be a bit harsh. I will say mood going plays a big role in King Kong. If my adrenaline was up, no high but great pain relief, If your mood is relaxed so is the high, from what I have experience. Great stuff definitely worthy of any smoker.”"

Consider yourself lucky if you come across Kong.”"

JohnnyVapor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/king-kong/reviews/1334521,"“Very smooth on the inhale and quite relaxing. Works medically on my hypertension. I'd say this is definitely indica dominant. I've got a bit of a tolerance, so I won't comment on the length of the high, so to speak, but for me, it lasts as long as anything else does these days.”"

CherryBowl,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/king-kong/reviews/1345867,"“My experience could be due to the fact I don't have a grinder, but I'm not a fan of how KK burns at all.  Very ashy and I keep spitting out ash when I'm like a quarter of the way left in the bowl.  The high is relaxing, and it does what it needs to though.  I recommend a grinder for a better experience that's for sure.”"

Buds were tight and dark green. Had a nice smell of citrus, sour, and then a pine, grass undertone. The taste to me was very nice, quite kushy and skunky. Strong smelling, I smoked a joint and the house really stunk of bud. Effects were nice, quite a strong mental buzz to start with before the indica sid...”"

Has a great taste but very little thc content. Would not recommend this to the usual smoker. Maybe for a first timer smoker but never getting this again.”"
