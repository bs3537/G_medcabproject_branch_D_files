Super Kush
=============
snowbunniii420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1418651,"“This is probably the most motivated and energetic I've felt after smoking any kush. Definitely an excellent choice for moms trying to get the housework done before the kids get home.”"
StevenEffLeo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1418650,"“picked up a quarter of this stuff and so far it's awesome. smoked a bowl of this i'm well medicated.”"
cannabb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1372500,"“I vaped Super Kush last night and as the bag filled,I noticed the smoke wasn't all that thick, but it sure packed a nice punch. The initial euphoria was worth the experience alone. It calmed into a pleasant clear headed buzz with some nice waves through the body. I slept amazing.”"
KraZy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1418649,"“Pretty good smoke. Gives me a light, nice n happy head high. Along with the "wtf was I typing?" stoned you would get from this awesome Indy. Got me pretty damn burnt. Super Kush!!”"
cannabb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1393427,"“I love the euphoric kick off this strain immediately engulfs the mind with. It's nice because my head still feels clear and I don't feel stupified. It's easing into a calm, relaxing, happy experience.”"
ScipioAfricanus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1344017,"“Very unique smell. It has a woodiness-- almost incense-like aroma. Just like the smell, the taste is quite unique; hints of incense-mintiness with a slight tropical fruit aftertaste. The feeling is very euphoric without any perceivable couch lock. Whole body high with a nice cerebral buzz. This strain increased my appetite and helped with my nausea much more than I thought it would. I strongly recommend this strain t...”"
sneer002,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1372499,"“takes a while for this one to come on, slowly builds. Once you're fully in though you're like in a black hole of memory. Clear head. Feel good.”"
oldfartincanada,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1437182,"“Straight up indica that buzzes your entire body right down to your tingly toes. A good one to chill out on the couch with some munchies and Netflix. Turpentine mixed with a grassy, earthy flavor.”"
petethekoala,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1262851,"“A mellow strain that melt pain and stress away without being overwhelming. I love this one for a shopping trip or a little short hike in the forest. It's Earthy, sweet and pungent like most kush but the one I got wasn't dominant at all. The buzz was very good and largely compensated the lack of taste. You fell relax, happy, you want to talk to peoples. Good strain to initiate someone to cannabis!”"
TheBigGreenGiant,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1347569,"“This has to be one of my favourite strains I've had in recent times.  Got a fresh batch and the buds were perfect in terms of being reasonably dry on the surface but sticky in the middle and ground up quite well as there wasn't as much friction as what is normally encountered with sticky indicas.  Maybe a bit critical, but the only factor that prevented a 5 star rating was the lack of flavour, it does seem somewhat n...”"
tooopy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1356424,"“Relaxing, mind easing strain. It clears my head from bad thought and calms me down nicely. My body feels heavy, but I can still get and do stuff unlike with some other indicas that can make me get stuck in the couch or bed. I have some anxiety and some strains can make it worse but this one is the opposite. The only bad effect I could feel was a dry mouth 10-15 minutes after I smoked. Would recommend to others who wa...”"
fangningsheng,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1350858,"“Super Kush is a nice, easygoing indica that is suitable for use almost any time of day. Although it is an indica, Super provides a clear-headed stone without overwhelming couch-lock effects. Super has a very soft, warm body high and relaxing, happy mental effects. Great strain for treating anxiety and depression. The nugs I acquired were quite visually appealing, being very frosty and possessing orange hairs spread t...”"
joshzb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1709262,"“Had a quick wake and bake this morning using this strain, since the description said it doesn't couch lock you, and it definitely doesn't lie. I was clear headed, focused, yet relaxed and anxiety free. 

A great strain for the day.”"
6644stonerz,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1336843,"“hella cool!
hella jazzy, really jazzy!
really bright, poppin off.
got a lot of energy and it's really exciting, like a fun place to be.
good for the living room.”"
JoshLoc,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1319789,"“Nice functional high, some euphoria and mild body stone. Good day time indica. I don't usually mix cultivars but I've been mixing this with some purple candy and wow! The two mixed is amazing, it's like two puzzle pieces fitting together. Try it if you get a chance.”"
mkbergen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1417312,"“Picked it up off a medical local dispenser online. Love the effects; I'm not stuck to the couch, but still feel a lot of body relaxation. I can focus cognitively, my mind doesn't race, and I feel an increased desire to be active. The taste isn't as fresh as I'd like, but it isn't harsh and has a mild earthy tone. Works great for a good price, would recommend for wanting to relax.”"

Astro_Jay,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1381482,"“To put it succinctly, the strain is decent and feels like an Indica. The "burn"faze at the end of the stone really puts you to sleep but you have to wait for it.”"

hotshot7000,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1648838,"“Before Smoking: Has a rather strong odor, just as the info says, it has a wild woody smell, but with a strong tar/diesel like smell. Very Dense, crystally buds, has some gorgeous purple hues amongst its trichomes.

newtocali,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1071490,"“A great buzz, while it lasts. Definitely a night cap strain. Not the best taste, and kind of a weak smell. Trichomes cover this one, but unfortunately this time that doesn't mean fire. A good solid strain, but not to be capped above $50 if my batch sets the bar.”"
sneer002,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1071494,"“clear headed. can get stuff done with this. great smell. really moist, can get a lot out of it. good next-day medicinal effects (happy, less anxious, less stressed)... just makes you feel darn good :-)”"

Jimmyk164,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1275286,"“Awesome strain, could have been a bit drier. The smell wasn't overwhelming until chopping up a nug. Then it really stinks lol very skunky aroma and flavour and after smell. Not great if you are in public and want to be low key but I tend not to worry about that much. A heavy hitter and an instant hitter. Hits you in the face right away, develops into a couchlock and lingers for a good while. Great for appetite, pain ...”"

Ceidan,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1249447,"“Very mellow relaxing high,  enough will put you right off to dreamland but dosing is easier to dial in than more potent options like GDP or Death Bubba, if you need to be relaxed yet creative smoke a little if you need some sleep smoke alot”"
AgentSeven,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1273407,"“I really like this strain. It leaves me feeling clear headed, happy and relaxed and works wonders for pain. It does not make me anxious at all and it is more of a head high but has some body high to go along with it. The flavour is quite pleasant as well, grassy, and a little fruity. The only downside for me is that it makes me incredibly hungry and that effect lasts a while.”"
Sociallyhermittable,https://www.leafly.com/indica/super-kush/reviews/1319257,"“Super Kush eases me into relaxed, clear-headed euphoria. I feel happy and content, and I often find myself smiling out of the blue. Every time I smoke it, I feel the need to stop, close my eyes, and breath deeply for a few seconds. It's therapeutic. I could smoke this everyday, anytime of day.”"
