The strawberry flavor really shines out while smoking it, AND lingers around well after.  Delicious. Very relaxing effects without the "couch lock" feeling.  If anything, you'll just fall asleep.  Fruity, sweet, smoke with some OG (of course) pungency.  I'd recommend anything that this company makes, especially this "Strawberry Blondie".”"

Strawberry Blondie is the perfect indica-dominant hybrid. The aroma of the flower is very sweet and the flavor has a sweet strawberry undertone too. Very tasty, potent and exotic flower s/o LA Kush for always providing fire exotics!!”"

It hits you hard when you don't expect it. The packaging and quality on this strain is straight fire. Smells fruity, dense and it tastes amazing. One blunt and I'm sky high haha

Am a fan of LA KUSH so, I decided to give it a try and a greater surprise from smoking I have never had. Yes, the buds I had were on the smaller side but, I forgot about that looking at it. The buds are light green and are covered in lots of small droplet trichomes. Then the golden brown pistils add to the visual appeal. Mellow fruit smelling/tasting strains aren't...”"
