BrianH710,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/frostbite/reviews/1375675,"“Unfortunately this Leafly review is incorrect. The Frostbite strain was created in Phoenix in 2012 after medical marijuana initiatives were passed In AZ. It is a cross of TGA subcool deep purple  combined with a pure Afghan Kush indica. It has a slightly purple color but mostly appears white because of the heavy coating of trichomes. This strain has a strong fruity and skunky smell similar to Grand Daddy purple(GDP) ...”"

The strain has beautiful crystals and bark red-purple hairs, with beautiful fluffy but tight buds. Smokes excellently in the bowl and has a clean fresh taste. One of my top 10 favorites.”"

LiveTruth,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/frostbite/reviews/1225136,"“I have tried this for the first time in Vape Liquid form.  It has been wonderful.  It has helped with pain from a very intense ear infection, while allowing me to still function/concentrate on what I am doing.”"

Effects last hours while it gives you an overall sense of peace.  
You will feel the buzz instantly while any negative energy is carried away and you're left with a big smile and a refreshed outlook on life.

I tend to get angry more often then I'd like, I can't help it though people just can be so aggravating. It's been 2 weeks I have been rela...”"

It was perfect because you're relaxed but you're still fully engaged mentally. The lightning show was spectacular and seemed to take on an added edge with the weeds effects. This is a great smoke for enjoying something that's visually stimulating. I sure do recommend this one.”"

CulinaryGenius,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/frostbite/reviews/1391626,"“Massive flowery buds! If grown correctly, the buds are huge and are covered with trichomes. This sativa is relatively strong and large doses will make you fall asleep. Lower to medium doses will help one relax and has an uplifting characteristic. The smell is a combination of some fruity note, but the flavour in my experience tends to be stronger. It definitely has some wort of wood note in the flavour. Great strain ...”"

Such a perfect combo, A Happy Mellow, relaxing all is good, best time of the day for sure! A delicious, frosty, blueish green bud appearance makes one almost feel guilty about disturbing this lovely prize winner, ENJOY!”"
BElKush,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/frostbite/reviews/1304414,"“I love it. It is definitely uplifting like the other gentleman said, and Bob Marley is perfect music for the journey with Frostbite. I'm probably going to write rhymes,creativity is probably so nice on this. What can I say? $mooth, with a nice and subtle popping taste to it. Interesting. The taste is like chewing a very mellow tea. Nice, in an odd way.
10/10 for the peaceful atmosphere Frostbite creates. Mama Ganja! ...”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/frostbite/reviews/1604439,"“A cool sativa. 
I'm using it for my pain
Makes you want to dance.

And that is my haiku about frostbite..

Overall a decent sativa, it gets the job done. It's a 4 star strain, not too potent so anxiety prone consumers shouldn't have any problems.”"
spaciegracie,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/frostbite/reviews/1742775,"“So, what I’ve noticed about this strain that I’m able to focus longer and at the same time feeling relaxed. I have anxiety and ADD. So on that it’s good. I have fibromyalgia so my pain is feels less.”"

HeavenYouAndI,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/frostbite/reviews/1060927,"“This strain is comparable to white widow for my partner and I. A lesser version of white widow. Very uplifting and euphoric. Lazy feeling but not too bad like being sleepy. Definitely periods of couch-lock if the tele is on. Overall nice high, definitely will do again.”"
thunk81,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/frostbite/reviews/1339632,"“once again, over rated sativa. what is with you sativa people? there's nothing to me more rewarding in a bag of buds, then characteristics of indica. low stems. not stringy. grown right. this sativa, like all sativas is inconsistent and frankly, the powder puff of football. I like my weed like I like my football: hard hitting. this is so not hard hitting”"
