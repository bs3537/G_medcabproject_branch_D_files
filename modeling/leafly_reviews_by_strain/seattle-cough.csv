Rawbrain,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/seattle-cough/reviews/1413775,"“Seattle Cough or The Cough as I call it since I'm from Seattle is my favorite strain of all time (I've smoked since 1970's).  It's my daily smoke that is more medicine than recreational 

It gives an long lasting uplifting high. Very heady with creative thoughts and great feelings of euphoria. Great for outdoor projects. Never get headaches or morning hangover.

The medium density bud structure is fantastic with ligh...”"

receptoraptor,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/seattle-cough/reviews/1361261,"“My new go-to get-shit-done strain. Whenever my thoughts started straying toward procrastination it was much easier than normal to power through what I wanted to put off. It sparked my creativity as well. The best part is I was highly functional and able to think clearly enough to actually DO the good ideas I had come up with instead of couch locking and becoming too comfortable. Not sure if I would suggest it to a mi...”"

Fun strain in moderation, very motivational, happy vibes and an inclination to go out.  Beyond a bowl it shifts to a hybrid and 3 bowls in becomes a light indica

I suffer from depression and anxiety & this is the cure for it!”"

I've tried several different strains but nothing seemed to help me relax and chill for a while. Until I smoked Seattle Cough!! This is the bomb!!! Thank you Dutch Brothers for helping me chill!!”"
lvrgm,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/seattle-cough/reviews/1217465,"“Love this stuff. Euphoria and happiness but not the indica typical sedation. Best hybrid I have smoked for day use, or socializing.”"
WashingtonGreenery23,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/seattle-cough/reviews/1383956,"“Superb. Being from Tacoma a 45 minute drive to Seattle this strain hits home. A perfect sativa. No anxiousness. Just a relaxed cerebral experience where your cares seem to fade away. While staying motivated. I just put in a 8 hour shift at work and it seemed like no time at all. I was relaxed happy and not worried about time! That was a bowl before and on lunch. Expensive but worth it! I could see this maybe being th...”"
SaxyGreenGiant,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/seattle-cough/reviews/1157840,"“Really great hybrid despite the exorbitant costs at Green Theory. Excellent cerebral head high that allows for creativity and productivity if necessary, but also is great for relaxing as well. Great citrusy flavor when enjoyed through your herb cape of choice.”"
NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/seattle-cough/reviews/1235530,"“Honestly the first time I smoked this strain I was really let down. I'd been told how great it would be how amazing it was. There just didn't seem to anything special about it at all generic taste, generic smoke, just boring. But after having smoked it another few days I can say it has a fun upbeat high,  and the flavor is a mello citrus flavor that leans toward a grapefruit flavor that's really quite nice once you t...”"

Wow. My loss! Seattle Cough is now a go-to strain for me. It has the best of the sativa effects - uplifting, mental stimulation, creative impulses - layered with just enough body relaxation and chill to provide a fantastic experience.

I detect a moderate amount of expansion when smoked, so ...”"

Wolfmoney,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/seattle-cough/reviews/1548715,"“FINALLY. I am high. 
After dumping out wads of hard-earned coin on so much herb, I am finally stoned. It's a Festivus miracle. 
I've been trying all of the strains since moving to Washington, and was starting to think that all was hopeless and that maybe it was time to take a break. 
Alas, I've found what works for this long-time stoner. 

Smooth like butter. Creative and with it. I feel good.”"

Not my all the time weed but it is always available at my band's studio so I smoke it pretty regularly. It doesn't hit right away so you really need to be careful.

Great, quick, straight-to-the-dome high. Dry mouth, and a small tickle cough easily negated with a swig of beer, or your beverage of choice.
