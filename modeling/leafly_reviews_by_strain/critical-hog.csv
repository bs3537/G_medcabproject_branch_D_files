I am not a huge pure indica person, but I needed it for pain, nausea, and relaxation.

In addition, I ...”"

Good body high, can feel it in the front of my face/forehead area. 10 chills being "I'm slowly falling through space with my eyes locked open", this is like 8 chills. I'm a lightweight though😛”"

weazal,https://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-hog/reviews/1411372,"“A creeper that isn’t detectable until it wallops aside the head. Instantly went from feeling sober to mind being gone. Feels like Headband with a strong physical sensation around the head that simultaneously feels cloudy and drifty. Emotional state is surprisingly stable and unmoved. Despite the rootedness, there’s a wonderful euphoria elevating from the chest that lifts spirits. It’s prevalent and easily detectable,...”"

Manitoubass2,https://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-hog/reviews/1483718,"“Great strain for a pure indica that won't couch lock you or put you to bed.

Very relaxing though and works great on pain. 

I smoked alot of this strain yesterday and found it very odd I barely got the munchies at all??? Very odd for an indica strain IMO, as an indica mostly user I find my appetite is roaring most the time.

Only gave it 4 stars because I actually had a hard time falling asleep on this strain(which ...”"

Super happy, pain and stress melted away and it lasts too. The thc level in the flower I got tested to 21+.Will definitely be coming back to this. Just make sure you keep some water nearby!

Effects: it was a creeper and a couch-locker for sure. Pain and insomnia were nonexistent and had terrible munchies. Haha, not always a bad thing. 
Definitely something I’m going to keep in stock!”"
