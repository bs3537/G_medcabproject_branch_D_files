babygoddess,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1410781,"“If you're dealing with depression/bipolar disorder, this bud is really good for that. It made me feel like I was on cloud nine ;)”"
secondtimearound,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1392818,"“I suffer from a chronic illness along with depression  which leaves me in pain and fatigue and unable to function daily tasks well. I am new to using medical marijuana and enjoyed using this strain because I felt uplifted but not too "stoned". My SO said that I seemed "normal" and not out of it, which is important to me in using marijuana.”"
Asharp89,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1374294,"“I am not a smoker I smoke once or twice a month and that's a hit mabey two If I'm having a drink. Because of hearing this strain is very energetic and uplifting I decided to smoke almost half a joint myself. All I can say is that Im in love and just overall happy.”"
InfiniteDR3AMER,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1461788,"“The only strain I've ever felt for for 5 out of 5. I'm a VERY sensitive lightweight when it comes to... anything at all really lol. So, cannabis usually makes me paranoid. This strain was the absolute most euphoric, relaxing, calming highs I've EVER had. This was like laying in a pile of clouds. I suggest this to anyone that is stressed and just wants to smile, laugh, and go on a very comfortable euphoric cruise. 70%...”"
SaigonPagan,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1383958,"“One of my favorite. Can be difficult to track down. Definitely an uplifting experience. Best for a productive wake and bake day.”"
nicolels22,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1457580,"“i got this strain mainly bc it was the best sativa at the dispensary i purchased at. thank god for that bc i fell in love with this strain. i have been very depressed, fatigue & unable to focus on my homework. this morning i started it off with the sunshine and now it’s 2:00p & i’ve accomplished more than i have the past 2 weeks!! highly recommend if you need a mood booster & help focusing!”"
Michael9000,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1332369,"“Not disappointed with this strain some pretty good bud. Took a bong rips and after a few minuets I was already floating in my bathroom with the music. Great smooth hit, great to smoke for the day like shopping or or at a gathering.”"
claytont,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1232525,"“This is probably one of my new favorite sativas, and I rarely smoke sativas. This strain left my head in the clouds with the focus to get work done and enjoy some nature walks and bike rides before ski season starts. The smell immediately hits you like a ray of sunshine, warming your nostrils with its keef-coated trichoms.”"
oneupmshrm,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1366194,"“Wow! fantastic strain. Just picked this one up and I have to agree 100% with babygoddess's review. Works great with bipolar/depression. It puts you in a great place and wipes out your worries. Definitely my new fav.”"
MavisBeacon,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1716173,"“I've been using this in Heritage cartridge form for 4 weeks now. It seems many folks that previously reviewed felt happy and uplifted. I didn't. I got more focused and energetic. Very little on the pain relief part. I like that I'm able to do a lot of things in the house and stay focused (though I do find myself easily distracted if I smoke too much). I can, however, always re-route myself into the task I was previou...”"
MarshallJenkins,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1352193,"“Beautiful. It tasted great and made me feel amazing. It'll brighten your day - no wonder it's named Sunshine!!”"
earlofamerica,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1360242,"“While I often prefer Indica over Sativa, I always love good weed of any kind. Sunshine was good weed. While this might sound strange, Sunshine was one of those strains that it quickly becomes obvious how it got its name. Upon exhale, you get this very tropical, smooth aftertaste that reminds you of a sunny day. That's the way the buzz hits you. It isn't racing like some other strains, it's more like "Damn, I feel gre...”"
PonchoAshley,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1643020,"“Best sativa I've ever had.  Was so uplifting and gave me so much energy. Would 10/10 recommend”"
sywi,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1729440,"“A really nice, very happy strain. Like suddenly being on a tropical beach. For me, has all the uplift but none of the uncomfortable raciness of many other sativas. Also a pretty motivating and functional high (the phrase "functional high" actually sounds really dreary, now that I look at it; let's say that it's fun and nice without making one stupid. Terrific antidepressant and good for my agoraphobia -- suddenly I w...”"
schmaleo505,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1537963,"“Some of the frostiest and nicest looking nugs I've seen got me excited, but I wasn't a huge fan of the high. Made me kind of anxious as opposed to uplifted. Those prone to anxiety when smoking might want to start slow with this one.”"
WarMachineRyno94,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1459315,"“I suffer with depression. Got this for the first time today and turned on some Bob Marley. Let’s just say this is a magical experience and I don’t feel depressed.”"

RainSen,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1525467,"“What a strain to wake up to. so energetic and mentally stimulating. going on a walk everything seems super interesting. shapes, patterns, color combinations... on the edge of being psychedelic.  but instead of being fogged in like with some strains it's a really clearly observable effect. kept me awake through the night with flashing random thoughts in bed. activities of any kind- oh hell yeah. bedtime.... not possib...”"
pioneer_valley_green,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1715253,"“It a 12 week flowering plant. not the easiest strain in terms of growing. buds were big and sticky. i enjoyed smoking a lot of sunshine, which was recommended by a long time grower who sold me the seeds. very nice high. def something to enjoy in the daytime. i would recommend this strain to everyone.”"

katiekat21,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1604437,"“Awesome strain.  I got my hand on private grow, the buds were soft, sticky and a light green, like pea soup. It ground well, and is one hell of a high.  The Ssn I used to getting was a bud that was hard not stick, they were a different green, like it had been in the bottom of the. Grind it was small hard piece like oregano. Never going back to the dispensary.”"

marketwizard,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sunshine/reviews/1767808,"“One of the most potent strains I've had in a long time without any anxiety. Very sativa-like buzz producing a lot of energy. I wouldn't recommend this before you sleep to take the edge off a long day. This is best enjoyed in a party atmosphere or the day time to keep the vibe going and keep things light.”"

A battle with depression can be very difficult. I’m not about to give up on medication but some/most days the drugs just don’t cut the gloom. Enter-Cannabis. I have tried many strains in an attempt to find one that will lift me when I’m down. Sunshine seems to have all the positive qualities I have found in certain strains combined plus some.

It brightens up your day like the midday sun. Soon you’ll be feeling the days end. Wonderful day time strain, but wouldn’t recommend for wake-n-bake, especially those with a low tolerance. Potent stuff, wonderful effects. Safe in small doses if you get anxiety easily from sativas; however I do recommend for t...”"

The 1 oz glass jar was the trim/shake but you could tell that the tri-combs were baked right in as you could smell it and it got me pretty high. I'd give it a 7.5 to 8 (out of 10) on the high scale. A very smooth strain. Worth the purchase as I got the glass jar ounce for only $125. This is a good strain to pass am...”"
