One or two small hits was all that was needed to work, and that is saying something for me. The high is very euphoric, and surprisingly paranoia-free for a strong sativa. It was also fairly long lasting. Not a super flavorful smoke, but it had pleasing green tea and cedar overtones, quite smooth...”"
