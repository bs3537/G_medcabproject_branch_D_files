The trim job is non-existent, never seen anything as leafy as the small nug I got in my package. Speaking of the packaging, it's ugly, these growers really need to step up their game.”"

pinkpoppy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-lafayette/reviews/1172383,"“I enjoy this as an evening strain, dreamy and relaxing, yet not so sedating that you can't still get some creative work done. It seems to work well for PTSD, and bipolar depression.”"
asicath,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-lafayette/reviews/1081968,"“My first legal weed purchase! So much more mellow than whatever I've been smoking until now. The label says: "Providing a quick and euphoric effect and long last dreamy effect."”"

Mosstrack,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-lafayette/reviews/1230750,"“Sweet Lafayette is a skunky citrus, but you will rest assured that the resulting relaxation overcomes the strong aroma. It first hits you with a wave of euphoria that fades into a more mellow, gentle high.”"

PA00G,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-lafayette/reviews/1140515,"“6 to 8 hits and I was feeling great for a good 3 hours. Started with a ringing in my ears, followed by a tingling, and ended up just a touch dizzy... in a good way! I then had an enlightening conversation with the voice in my head but damned if I can remember what it was all about.”"
