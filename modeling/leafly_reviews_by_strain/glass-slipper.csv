For me this is the best strain I have tried, which fits all my needs. I have always been a Sativa guy. Love my daytime hi. My lady, whom runs a very large, successful business would never smoke with me, because it either knocked her out or made her paranoid. She is in her 50's. however the first time I ...”"

puppybreath07,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/glass-slipper/reviews/1373476,"“This strain is a hybrid but it is sativa dominant.   I love this strain. This is my favorite sativa. Music is amazing, foods taste incredible, smells evoke feelings. It heightens all of your senses. Makes you feel like you don't have a care in the world. All you want to do is dance and giggle. What a fantastic escape from pain and stress and anxiety. Try it, you will love it!”"

Glass Slipper gives a nice vaped taste and has a 'way up there' high.  Expect the brilliant part of the high to last just as long as you want it to.  As noted, the taste is probably the best that I've found.  No paranoia. Lightweights go easy as THC is 22%+.  If you want mellow then check out Presidential OG Kush.  ns”"

If I'm stressed or my depression is really bad this takes care of everything. I'm an indica lover, but this could change that. Just incredible. Not for beginners tho, if grown right this is very potent and will knock you out. Absolutely incredible.”"
