tknight1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shiskaquine/reviews/1440518,"‚ÄúLoved it! For those that don't know, CBD will not give you the same high like something heavy on thc would. It does give you a "head change" type of feeling, but only for about 5-15mins, and it's sort of like the "thc" effects, but after, you're just very relaxed, in body and in mind. Not a couch lock, but it works for aches, pains, positive thinking (I have major depressive disorder) and headaches. I've also have go...‚Äù"
queenbirdie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shiskaquine/reviews/1440288,"‚ÄúI feel as if this strain was made for me. It's insanely good for anxiety, social anxiety & PTSD. It's a giggly happy high but not uncontrollable giddiness. Perfect for smoking before work where you need to be coherent and focused. 
   Please consider this is a very high CBD and very low THC before you review badly. I think for pain you need more of a THC level than CBD. This wasn't strong enough for my hubby (stone...‚Äù"
Desert_Groundskeeper,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shiskaquine/reviews/1461387,"‚ÄúNot being a fan of my mind and thought processes experiencing interference, or feeling like my head is going to float away into the sky, this Shishkaquine is something I have been waiting for! Blue Diesel, 9-Pound Hammer, Superman OG  all did ok, but for me just not what I'm looking for.  They all caused me to eventually lose interest in having a little herb occasionally, but this strain is something special and brou...‚Äù"
Emunahd,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shiskaquine/reviews/1447449,"‚ÄúThis is amazing. I loved MJ when I was in my late teens and twenties, but hormonal changes and thyroid issues changed the way I processed herb and I used to become so paranoid...I gave it up. 

I just took 2 mellow hits with a vape, and...bliss. All my aches are gone and I have a mellow feeling, but still able to function. I can work, communicate, whatever I need to do. 

Education is the key. The high CBD:THC ratio ...‚Äù"
brainfodder,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shiskaquine/reviews/1460612,"‚ÄúExcellent CBD strain:

Pain relief achieved!  Reduced my nerve pain grief at least in half.

Smokes very smooth for me, no coughing fits!

No dry mouth!

*Works for me, and very low THC, no high from it.

Purchased .25/oz from Top Notch in L.V., MAT version, gave me vacuum sealed 8ths, so half is kept very fresh!

Taste is unremarkable on draw, a little earthy on exhales but not offensive & nugs smell to me like weak...‚Äù"
ter5y,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shiskaquine/reviews/1478281,"‚Äúthis is a great strain, pain prior to smoking is at an 11 on a scale of one to ten, after smoking its maybe a 4. I am a Marine who is medically retired, i have ptsd and im bipolar. but with this strain all of that goes away, and i can still pass a drug test!! (<<<proven this). I would recommend to all who have joint pain or mental issues! overall 4.8 out of 5 stars, for me could have more of a head change‚Äù"

furrepanther,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shiskaquine/reviews/1558922,"‚ÄúAmazing, is the word I would use.  The CBD/THC balance with the terpene profile unique to this plant, makes for an amazing, comfortable high.  Blows anxiety out of the ballpark.  Kudos to Matrix NV for an excellent concentrate; the berry aftertaste is the most epic thing I've experienced from cannabis outside of its obvious effects xD‚Äù"
StarLoverPeace,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/shiskaquine/reviews/1412399,"‚Äúno no no. this shit doesn't work for fibromyalgia patients. it takes the pain away temporally, then after a couple of yawns it wears off and the pain comes back 10 fold... HORRIBLE.‚Äù"
