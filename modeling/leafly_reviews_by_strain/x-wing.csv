Great if under weight and need the munchies .. keep a sack full of snacks on hand .. did also have a very bad case of dry mouth .. 

Pain relief was above average with a taste that was earthy and bit of pungent aroma !!”"

brickie74,https://www.leafly.com/indica/x-wing/reviews/1673579,"“I love it....bought a 1/4 oz. of popcorn buds and every time I grind a bud or two it smells and feels amazing. Mine had a fairly strong citrusy smell with a touch of pine and a faint diesel secondary smell. After grinding..... it was very sticky and burned just right (nice and slow but completely) in a bong. Nice strong buzz...kind of sink into the couch.....perfect for a zoning out on a movie....have some popcorn or...”"
