kola.bear.farm,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramel-candy-kush/reviews/1381762,"“This sweet and heady treat has been growing at the kola bear farm for awhile now after being gifted by a fellow 541-Crew friend. Expect a smooth and rich smoke laced with hints of Vanilla and burned sugar with traces of coffee and toffee with that classic old school OG finish. Caramel Candy Kush is a great strain for chilling out and watching a movie or unwinding after a long day while your aches and pains fade away.”"

danilem,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramel-candy-kush/reviews/1371505,"“This concentrate offers amazing relief from chronic pain and the muscle spasms that come along with it. CCK concentrate literally tastes like caramel candy when vaped! As a well seasoned medical user I can also say this strain has a great recreational value. Def closer to an indica than a hybrid. So prepare to sit back and relax! For sure an all time favorite :D”"
whaumpis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramel-candy-kush/reviews/1370919,"“I got super ripped off of my first hit. I honestly couldn't feel my face after the second bong rip. It's maintaining that feeling as well, so I've been stretching it out between bowls of lesser stuff so I can enjoy it for as long as I can.”"
MountainMamaCO,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramel-candy-kush/reviews/1388317,"“The wonderful taste, smooth exhale and immediate effects of this strain are amazing. As a medical patient, I appreciate the pain relief and reduction of stress that it brings to the table. Heavy hitter that is well worth trying.”"

iread2xs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramel-candy-kush/reviews/1357576,"“Best indica strain I have tried so far but you know but before medical marijuana we had no idea what an indica, sativa etc was. All I know is this strain gave me a nice mello body tingling stay at home and read on the couch kind of high. Pain and anxiety were forgotten, but not truly gone just dulled for a while. I will keep my eyes open for this strain again once I run out #420sweepstakes”"

MedicatedPDX,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramel-candy-kush/reviews/1368476,"“Amazing hybrid here - very strong body relaxation as well as clear mental effects. Maybe a little more indica than Sativa but still pretty balanced high. Definitely recommend!”"
misterguydude,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramel-candy-kush/reviews/1384942,"“First hit tastes better than any weed I've ever smoked. It's delicious; almost tastes like chocolate or something sweet. Very easy, smooth rips. It's pretty potent, but not as heavy as a typical sativa-heavy strain. It's effing pretty to stare at, too. I show this stuff off to newbies and friends whenever possible. My local guy always has some available, and it's always so damn sticky I can barely roll it up!!! Get t...”"

NoRobo,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramel-candy-kush/reviews/1200394,"“Never heard of this particular flower before purchase. The terpene profile is amazing. Lots of different smells going on with sweet being most of them. The effects are strong yet creative and energetic. Gets your mind thinking, any project you have been putting off, you may just have an idea and finish it. This particular flower was grown by Sons of Agronomy. THC 18% CBD .09”"
Jessedubb716,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/caramel-candy-kush/reviews/1421878,"“This strain, if grown right, smells and tastes exactly like what the name is. I get hints of sweet caramelly vanilla when I take a big whiff. When I vaporize this strain is when I have tasted a sweet candy the most. Perfect for middle of the road high, however, this did not help with my pain much.”"

Also smelled a second pheno available, had the odor of a squash/ pumpkin, very interesting.”"
