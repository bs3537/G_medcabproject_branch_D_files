Tangerine
=============
Bubbles1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1417069,"“Smoked with a friend and we both loved Tangerine so much that we went back to buy more the next morning. This is a fun, euphoric, giggly and potent high with energy in the beginning and then deep happy relaxation at the end. We highly recommend this strain!”"
undeadslosh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1384364,"“Smells exactly as it tastes, a very strong tangerine/orange scent is emitted as soon as you open your container. The first hit is heaven, tasting like you just bit into a tangerine, it's very enjoyable. The high is amazing as well, feeling energetic and happy. Definitely a favorite.”"
sirfrancelott,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1415288,"“love this strain! use it to self medicate for crohn's and RA. doesn't give much of an appetite stimulant but it's great in all other aspects- energy boost, stress relief, euphoria, and smells devine. Will definitely want to keep this strain on hand 👍”"

hemphop420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1415199,"“Nice hairs and taste would definitely purchase again 🇨🇦
It's a well balanced high the dry mouth is bearable one does not get extremely hungry but lots of fluids are necessary to enjoy the ride 😎 you digg!?”"
BlazeItandPraizeIt,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1206380,"“I enjoyed Tangerine but it is definitely a strong sativa-dominant hybrid.  For me, it provides a mentally stimulating high with very little lethargy, and a fruity flavour profile with hints of citrus as well as pineapple and some flat mango notes.  This is a great strain if you need to get the housework done or be productive, as there is little to no indica induced 'couch lock' present.”"
ashick23,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1415198,"“This strain is noticeably sativa dominant. It had me loving the music I was playing. Great taste. Amazing smell. Pretty looking sticky buds. I enjoyed this one for sure.”"

James Bond,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1417751,"“What can I say about tangerine that is honest and also brutal at the same time. Lest start by saying if you don't respect this strain then you will find out very quickly moderation is the law when it come to smoking this one. Smoke too much and you will end up in the bathroom puking your guts  out. Smoke just enough and you will enjoy movies like you have never seen them before. This strain is my go to for the ultima...”"

Taste: five stars. Duration: five stars. Beauty: priceless. Effects: also priceless. Is it good in the morning?: Absolutely. 

Smells like an orange. Taste like an orange. But like a fine cigar orange where even the smoke feels like a smudge stick of bright light. It's like eating an orange pops...”"

I used it one of the first mornings and it was very strong. It's a blended honey edible which is distributed by a state run medical dispensary. I find it's a bit strong for me for the mornings. I put a half a teaspoon in some tea at night and drink it very slowly. It hits pretty hard. I am a lightweight. I find it brings out a bit of anx...”"

funkmasterphlex,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1415202,"“If you want a pretty mellow mood enhancing strain, this is it. The strain definitely leans toward sativa effects, with a nice energizing head buzz and eye pressure that took effect, not immediately, but minutes after, very gradually. It was one of the most accommodating come ups I've had. My mood improved the more I smoked, that's no doubt. And more than just the usual mood improvement you get from smoking all the ma...”"

I was hesitant to give it a shot at first because of the name “Tangerine”, it just didn’t seem appealing.

VJvalvenus420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1220579,"“I thought this was a little on the weaker side. This strain should be consumed  more for beginners and novice. If you like the "higher" THC strains then I wouldn't recommend Tangerine in particular. Although the taste is on point, just low THC. So ENJOY and smoke responsibly..Peace&♡♡♡”"

Actually bought a bunch thinking just that, but quickly learned looks can be deceiving. After smoking never tasted any citrus.in fact. It was harsh and had very little kick. I wont buy anything with a good name unless i try first. My conclusion is this strain is played out.”"

The first thing you notice is the smell which entices you and the taste leaves you surprised, what does it taste like and what does smell like? The name of the strain says it all!”"

Puma2015,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1317953,"“love this strain! it really smell like oranges, I couldn't stop smelling I was pretty impressed. At first I got full of energy and couldn't control my talking since my mind was fast. THen shortly after that everything was just in slow motion least I thought it was... then I just felt heavy and giggly and Sooooo relax and chilled.”"
cidpchris,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1362555,"“I am new to the idea of vaping. Usually, I'll hit the vape pen later in the day, after I've already smoked. Last weekend, I tried vaping first and WOW. I got the best buzz and pain relief ever. Not sure if it was the strain or process, but it gave a lot of relief delivered in a more cerebral way. Will definitely try again. Hey growers, how about a bit more of a selection of disposable vape pen flavors and potencies.”"

The high is ok but medically it was average. Definitely a chill strain though. Not an energetic strain you can get from sativas.”"

AinWA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1224387,"“Agent Orange is my favorite citrus strain; this runs a close second.  Tangerine has diesel overtones while Agent Orange has more of a peppery taste.  Anyone that likes citrus flavor will like this strain.  Use a vape or your favorite glass piece that brings out the flavors.  I experienced a very long aftertaste with citrus lingering in my nose long after the exhale.  Taste + a great high; strains like this spoil me a...”"

svrreel,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1313087,"“Tangerine is great for day use. It makes me friendly and appropriately outgoing. I can focus on tasks and I feel incredibly creative. Kills nausea, but doesn't really kill my lower back pain. 

I can smoke this while working (discreetly on a break, of course) and stay on task. I don't get too bummed when I come down either, so that's a plus. Great for stress.”"
UsersLoseDrugs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1361420,"“Fun head effects. I LOVED taking it for a hike but when I smoked it sitting at home it brought on a bit of paranoia.

This strain smells amazing, when you get complemented on your cologne after smoking you know you smell great haha. also the body high at the peak is pretty good as well.”"
OldFormat,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1248082,"“Very nice. Seems rare these days to find a heady, sativa-dominant strain. Energy, awareness, smiles and productivity. No super self-consciousness or anxiety geek outs. Very strong. Started with jays, but I think this is better enjoyed in a glass bowl.”"
JordanMcCaughey77,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tangerine/reviews/1251942,"“This is one of my favorite strains of all time. The description is a tad misleading, saying it is very dense, I disagree, i think its rather light, but burns well and is surprisingly strong for how light and smooth it is.”"

After one hit my eyes and body slumped feeling the full effects of the potent strain. Very euphoric and almost a perfect blend of energy and laziness. Absolutely loved this strain and would buy it again!”"
