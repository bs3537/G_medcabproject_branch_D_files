HelloMyNameIsSteve,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mad-dawg/reviews/1399261,"“has a very sweet piney smell....good smoke recommend you smoke out of a bowl can be smoked out of paper but gets really sticky and residue starts to build up clogging the mouth piece....the smoke taste is quiet smooth but has a slightly strong sharpness to the hit...AMAZING smoke texture and mildly minty taste for the price overall highly recommended for those who are low on cash yet not compensate for quality.

hi2,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mad-dawg/reviews/1223463,"“Interesting strain.  I had to vape quite a bit for it to kick in, but once it did......whoa.......mostly stony.  Relaxing and makes your face feel weird!  Watched Ancient Aliens and it seemed more fascinating and scarier than usual.”"
igotowest,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mad-dawg/reviews/1396006,"“This stuff kicks ass!  I had my davinchi dry vaporizer and I loaded it up with this stuff.  I kept hitting and hitting at least 12 times I inhaled this.  When it hit it was the most euphoric I've ever felt.  This stuff is seriously potent and it's definetly worth the asking price.

isndrde,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mad-dawg/reviews/1288820,"“It's has a clean and smooth smoke, it's not harsh on the throat. The smell isn't that strong,but the effects didn't last as long as I hoped it would. But over all its a good one.”"

Notyonacho,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mad-dawg/reviews/1139461,"“Very good, functional high. It makes me appreciate the way things feel or taste and it makes me happy and affectionate. It doesn't last very long though and I had to smoke a lot of it to maintain. Overall not bad”"
Free2beme,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mad-dawg/reviews/1247770,"“I went in to this place, not seeing any strains I had ever heard of before. So , I really wasn't expecting to pick a flower at all. but this Budtender was one fire about this strain. I just had to try it. WELL SHE WAS RIGHT!!!!! It tasted great and I went to sleep . so this strain has my stamp of approval like yaaaaa! big time. it was at the place on 99 by Taco Time. The chic was really helpful and funny.so asking ge...”"
crixno,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mad-dawg/reviews/1629450,"“Happy, clearheaded, feel good high. Very balanced classic 50/50 hybrid feeling. Relaxed, but with a jolt of cerebral euphoria. Be careful not to smoke this if you have a headache, because it can either cause one or make it worse. Great sweet, earthy, pine smell and taste.”"
SirEnglish,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mad-dawg/reviews/1312179,"“Great strain. Looks nice and isn't too loud. Smoke is smooth and the taste is very pine and earthy. Good high. Definitely felt pretty tired after about an hour. Didn't even need the whole bowl.”"
epayne5,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mad-dawg/reviews/1323345,"“One of the best strains i have ever smoked. Good shit i smoked over the thanksgiving holiday and ate good. I smoked like 5 blunts and was on cloud 9.”"
dawgwings,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/mad-dawg/reviews/1187129,"“Great  Hybrid! A very happy, creeper relaxation for sure! Sweet and Earthy, and sticky to the touch. Breaks up with a good return with a lemon pine exhale. Sneaks up with a intense stone that eases into a relaxed, yet busy and alert, fun time! Will turn up that appetite a notch as well, another rare find that I will definitely purchase again!”"
