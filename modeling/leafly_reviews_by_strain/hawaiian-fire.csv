I love listening to music with this strain because I do not feel tired. This strain is really good to use throughout the day.‚Äù"

DrRedEyez,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-fire/reviews/1321441,"‚ÄúThis strain lives up to its billing!  By far one of the best Sativas, and I am am loving it! As I am doing this review, I've just smoked some right now.  This particular batch has a lemon and tropical scents.  Just like Hawaii, this strain has a very laid back and uplifting vibes going on.  As the intial part of the high kicks in, you experience a onset of uplifting head high.  This is soon flows through you and in t...‚Äù"

If you can find it buy at least a 1/4, they constantly run out of it everywhere I order.‚Äù"

Talm310,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-fire/reviews/1488461,"‚ÄúI've smoked a lot of sativa strains & this is one definitely f*** stood out! Im telling u smoke this s*** and u'll taste a difference. It taste sweet and it gets u high asf. Definitely recommend.‚Äù"
emoteriyaki,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-fire/reviews/1332882,"‚ÄúExactly how they describe it, dreamy and vacation like, you can almost hear the waves. Very euphoric and extremely relaxing but no couch lock that is for sure. Really good for my chronic back pain too.‚Äù"
Qewqew,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-fire/reviews/1073005,"‚ÄúVery nice head buzz. This would be a good one to go outside and take your dog for a walk or exercise or just get out and do something active. EXTREME munchies with this weed-but that's OK, because this strain makes everything taste amazing.
Definitely not for someone looking for a strain for body pain or a giggly euphoric high.‚Äù"
chakra,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-fire/reviews/1073011,"‚ÄúBest strain I've had in awhile. Nothing but good vibes and good thoughts from me when I'm smoking this. Listening to music is a whole 'nother level. I was able to focus too. Really wakes you up and gets you going.. Whatever it is you're doing. The come down is super subtle too, just how I like it. I stopped smoking for some months now but wanted to buy my last batch of weed before my recommendation expires and I'm so...‚Äù"
Zero,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-fire/reviews/1206755,"‚ÄúI loved the spicy flavor. The high just had me absolutely energetic and fuckin roaring, then it calmed down slow and I felt calm and mellow and focused.Definitelt not for those with anxiety. The strain switches from being indica dominant high to mostly sativa, then switches back to indica in time. At first I was not that impressed cuz the high was most certainly a creeper. After two packs of a freshly bought bowl, I ...‚Äù"

Feeling euphoric. good stuff. but im still functional. isnt too strong. can barely open my eyes though... feels heavy‚Äù"

Anonymous,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/hawaiian-fire/reviews/1072998,"‚ÄúI found this to put me in a very good mood. Flavor is fairly smooth but nothing like the specialty strains like grape/graple etc. Its a slight chemical taste but its not bad at all. It is not super strong but it does a good job with what it has, potency-wise. Effects last a couple hours, perhaps less. It vaporizes fairly well.‚Äù"
