Argyle

rosapisces,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1410686,"“Right now this is my fav. I use it for pain but love the pleasant mood and contentment it gives me. I sometimes catch myself smiling for no reason, which can't be a bad thing. No couch lock, decent motivation - overall sense of wellbeing. Definitely my 'go to' for an average day. 

Also for a person who doesn't smoke, and struggles with the taste of some this one is nice.”"
mike420501215,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1391985,"“best strain for me. woodsy musty taste but very smooth I order it every time I place an order. very effective for pain relief and also for stress. doesn't knock you on you a$$ but still get a nice jello feeling. I recommend this strain for anyone who hates feeling immobile but still likes a potent strain. tweed does an amazing job growing this strain if you live in Canada.”"
Soulfly3,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1330384,"“First time medical user and my first ever order with Tweed. Process was painless, quick, and long weekend aside, shipping was ultra quick.

Argyle was the FIRST of 4 strains I opened and sampled. 

Buds were nice size, dense w a "dryish" look, but not dry at all. Smell wasn't oniony in my opinion, but definitely earthy.. maybe even soily? Then again, Ive been working in the garden all day, so maybe it's that.

Dosed ...”"
ZeroTrousers,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1266619,"“Received 5 grams from Tweed as a Medical order. This strain comes out of the jar in loose almost fluffy buds mid-green with some sugar leaves showing a dark almost purple-blue-green colour.  The buds are trimmed okay, but not great (too many sugar leaves) The "5 gram" jar weighed in at 4.93 grams, which is within measurement standards for Canadian Licensed Producers. 

The flowers themselves break apart well and are ...”"
thechef2016,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1437952,"“I got Sun Grown Argyle from Tweed. I like the flavor, smell and effects better than the regular one Tweed sells. Great all day pain relief.”"
pbass4life,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1281488,"“OK strain. I am an insomniac. Got to sleep OK but it didn't last. Woke up 4-5 times during the night.”"
GimpyTwoLegs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1181954,"“This is a very rewarding plant to regularly mediate with. It will keep you feeling great and not too tired. The high CBD effects are amazing and it really does an excellent job with the acceptance of chronic pain. This is my go to strain for all day use. I find I function well and keep up with all my responsibilities. Very nice grow from TWEED. Highly recommended.”"
LadyMacKenzie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1516493,"“This is actually the first bud I ever used with my prescription and it is still my favourite. I love the smell, and the flavour. I like that it kills my pain, but I can still function normally.”"
MMPRCanada,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1276384,"“I went with Argyle+ by Tweed, a more potent strain than Argyle. This is a nice strain for those that like a nice dreamy couch lock effect. Great for just lazing pain free and watching movies or drifting to tunes. Very nice orange hairs throughout GREAT STRAIN”"
poppysmokk420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1500559,"“This is my first cannabis strain review. 
I am a medical cannabis user from Germany. 
I use Cannabis to treat my epilepsy, because even after trying 5 different medication, I still had bad seizures. 
I first tried to treat the seizures by my own, with weed bought from the streets, and it helped me a lot. Every time I had an seizures I smoked like one gram and I had no more seizures for the next 2 days. 
Then I asked ...”"
Dio3433,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1181955,"“Very nice strain.  Relaxing, smooth and all around a great feel after about 15-20 mins.    Even gets the arousal level up there, which is a nice bonus!!”"
BakedBelyn,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1515400,"“Despite this strain's relatively low THC levels, this indica can still induce a lovely relaxing mental high. What draws most people to this Quebecois version of Nordle is its amazing pain eliminating quality, with a 1:1 ratio of THC to CBD. This bud is perfect for medical patients looking for long-lasting pain relief without a killer high.”"
Puffpuff98,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1226592,"“This strain makes sex so much better I had to buy another ounce.”"
blondpinke,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1447083,"“works for pain but find myself not getting much done once I take it.”"
AouB,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1783941,"“Most balanced smooth high I have ever had. I have a huge soft spot for indicas, and this doesn’t dissapoint. I like to be able to smoke a few hits and come away not feeling too “gone” so this is perfect. The CBD comes in to really round off the already relaxed high.”"
RatTzy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1771959,"“Light and pleasant.”"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1302742,"“Argyle was one of the first strains I tried when first receiving my medical marijuana prescription. It is a high CBD low THC strain. I find it only moderately effective for pain relief and it does leave me feeling a bit burnt out once it starts to wear off so for me it's not a good option for daytime use. I do mix this strain in oil form with Hindu Kush (oil) to bump up the CBD for use at night to facilitate a good n...”"

My 5.gr might not be nordle. Hit's me like a train everytime. I get so dizzy its unreal. MAssive Munchies you will empty the fridge.Good to eat, relaxe and sleep.**********

fibroleptic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1446719,"“Decent for pain and nausea relief, but as a medical user I had to use a lot to get much effect (which I did kind of expect from the percentages). Seems like it would be a good introductory strain for new patients or anyone with lower tolerance, but if you need a strain to blast away severe chronic pain this might not be it. I made some into a salve and it does have more effect topically. It smells great and it's defi...”"
gordog,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1315876,"“Was helpful for pain. Other than that it was rather weak. I found it had a rather pleasant odour.”"

Meallou,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1238443,"“This strain has a really good taste and it still gets me really high. It's funny, that the school where I graduated has exactly the same name (coincidence? I don't think so!) It is my favourite indica strain at the moment.”"
psychedelicshrugs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1375286,"“Nice focused, clear-headed high. Helps decently with pain and gives me a bit of energy. I feel like I can get things done on Argyle. My current favourite.”"
canabigerol,https://www.leafly.com/indica/argyle/reviews/1191108,"“Amazing strain. Very light euphoric feeling and a medium happy feeling.  Would be nice to have more of a happy/giggly effect though.  Great for relaxation and pain.  It has a earthy smell and taste.  Same strain as nordle.  People report a garlic onion smell and taste,  I don't notice that as much.  This is one of my favorite strains now.  Originally I was second guessing buying it,  but now I'm glad I did.”"
