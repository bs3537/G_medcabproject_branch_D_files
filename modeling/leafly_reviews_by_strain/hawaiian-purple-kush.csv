Great medical benefits, great for creative stimulation. I was writing and painting for hours. Also for the ladies, orgasms are insanely more intense.”"

I picked up an 8th of this stuff on advice of a bud tender, who was selling it as a hybrid, but for me, this is a heavy hitting indica. This stuff gave me a wobbly head and googly eyes and kept me high for 3 hours.  It usually takes me 2-3 bowls to get nice and lifted, but one bowl in with HPK and I was gone.  I tried to watch a movie, but kept falling asleep.  Great for pain relief and insomnia.

Wiseguy80,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hawaiian-purple-kush/reviews/1390614,"“I was hesitant to try this strain because I get anxiety from Hawaiian strains, they are really potent sativas. well anyways I took two hits and that HPK is awesome stuff. good for pain, insomnia, and stress. if u smoke alot u will be tired, but your mind wants to go do stuff lol. good stuff,  definitely should try.”"

yardworks,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hawaiian-purple-kush/reviews/1355234,"“My sample of Hawaiian Kush was of mid-level quality. 14.69% thc / 1.87% cbd. Hits well, quite smooth and easy on the throat. Flavor of this sample was light and floral. This variety is nice but nothing super special. I would not bother to grow it.”"
elevatedinWA,https://www.leafly.com/indica/hawaiian-purple-kush/reviews/1163828,"“Nice and mellow.  Relaxing.  Pretty good concentration too.   Not too sedating, but definitely a calm one.  Fairly good at stimulating my appetite too.”"

You can definitely feel the influence of the two parents.  As a lover of most Purple Kush derivative strains, this does not disappoint.  The nugs I got from the store were just beautiful.  Thick, chunky buds just caked in amber and lab tested over 25% THC.  I grew one myself in a setup side by side with 9# hammer and GSC, and she had the fattest...”"

You smoke this strain and you get very lemony earth taste with pine undertones. The high is a slow building high, taking a longer than normal time to hit you, but when it does it hits like a truck. immediately relaxed and incredibly euphoric. it gets stronger over time and eventually it hits you harder than the first. incre...”"
