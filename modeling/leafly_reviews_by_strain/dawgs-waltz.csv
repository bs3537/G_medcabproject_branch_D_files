stonergirl1428,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dawgs-waltz/reviews/1389085,"“This is my go-to insomnia strain, also helping pain. I got mine from The healing corner in Bristol, Ct, & since we don't have regular strain names this was Theraplant's Jehana. It's definitely a couch lock strain, so much so I can't believe it's a hybrid. It definitely comes off more indica to me. My strain tested at 25% THC so if you're a beginner, watch out this one definitely creepes up on you. Also munchies are v...”"
Manuel13,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dawgs-waltz/reviews/1310697,"“I first tried this strain at Good Meds on Federal and it was surprisingly one that I would go back for. I recently got my red card and have been trying a few different dispensaries to see which one I like best and which ones have the best product. I was pleasantly surprised that the Dawg Waltz was a good strain that didn't make me feel too sleepy and made me very talkative. It was a pretty calming strain for me and h...”"

Very strong sedation effect.
Too strong too use for enjoyment.

Good for insomnia, pain.”"
conosur,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dawgs-waltz/reviews/1374270,"“this one seems to come on really fast, and then subdue you to a fixed position. YOU will not feel like moving and you will be extremely hungry, which is a terrible combination. lol. great strain for sleep, pain, and any lack of appetite.”"
SekhmetAkasha,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dawgs-waltz/reviews/1239448,"“Happy High! Indica-dominant. Smoked right before bed and was sort of scrambling through thoughts, almost spiritual high before finally knocking out. Slept like a baby. Would recommend for moon salutation meditation.”"

sageathor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dawgs-waltz/reviews/1339204,"“uplifting and calming, I feel blissful  after a one bowl wake and bake session. The pain reducing effects are noticeable as well. there is some increased gravity with the body however.”"

ItzSupperTime22,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dawgs-waltz/reviews/1354118,"“This stuff smells dank but tastes like a pine cone or chemicals. This is honestly one of my lesser favorite strains for that reason alone. It still delivers a tingly, relaxed body high but it left me with a headache and my muscle soreness only got worse after I was high. It also makes me very tired and couch-locked. I prefer sativa herb and berry flavors which explains why I'm not a fan of this earthy flavored indica...”"

This is the only strain that both takes away my pain and helps me get to sleep and stay asleep for the entire night. It is so relaxing and calm. The pain literally melted away and everything right now is peaceful and happy. If all of the people in the world used Dawg’s, it’d be a whole nicer place! I have a ton of pain and this just numbs my entire body. I am feeling no stress, no an...”"

MrGreen206,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dawgs-waltz/reviews/1285636,"“not to be bias since this strain was named after my step father David "Dawg" Grisman. I have been fortunate to have tried it a few times, but unless you are near Denver chances are you will never find it unless it makes its way to the NW. the hybrid is indica dominant, strong relaxing high 1 1/2 - 2 hrs. skunky and fruity. recommended if you can find it”"
High_im_Brett,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/dawgs-waltz/reviews/1286125,"“Top notch. Really fruity and skunky smell to it. Buds are big beautiful and fluffy with purple undersides and laden in crystals. The pain releaving effect and whole body stone is intense and unreal. This is a very unique strain and should be sought out or bought whenever seen. It's definitely worth adding to your list and is one of my personal favorites”"

Method- cannabuter , homemade veggie soup. 

Effects felt within 2 hours- tingly face, body - some dizziness - then mind drift 
Napped most of day ...
Freezing soup for a late night snack/ dinner to help with sleep”"
