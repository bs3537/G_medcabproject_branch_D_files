Orange Skunk

jeahisaidit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1339645,"“Orange skunk was a tasty treat with a very annoying side effect. After vaporizing the citrus, skunky flavored flower, the eye dryness kicks in. My levels of discomfort from the eye dryness went from merely annoying to flat out having my eyes as red as the devils dick. Not a discreet strain to medicate with, helped with the blues and had me talking my ass off. Pain levels were dulled but the effect only lasted an hour...”"

I find 🍊 strains (like Tangie) to border more on the bitter peel-flavor side of the aisle, so this lovely 🍊skunk truly defines it for me. Lemon 🍋 Skunk was a real fave of mine for a while, so I was excited to meet her smooth citrus-sister, & she does not disappoint! Extremely easy to smoke, no harshness on throat or lungs, so this is an excellent choice for newbies.. as well for the manage...”"

relaxing and pretty potent.. However i mostly enjoyed 
the taste and body high it was for me.
Pretty good strain if u cant fall asleep if u ask me lmao.”"

MarcoMelendez,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1336349,"“Es buena, un poco ácida al momento de dar golpe. Raspa mucho, eso indica que es buena hierba.  Cansa mucho los ojos, te pone muy risueño y difícil de concentrarse. 
Buena para fumar estando con amigos y reír mucho.”"

spectorbcn,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1288337,"“Got this after it was recommended by the bud tender. Normally I'm not a fan of sativas or sativa dominant hybrids, they always give me anxiety, but this was anything but. Nice dark green appearance with lots of orange hairs and crystals. Nice fruity smell but still very skunky. Great high ! Lots of head high without it being too much with just a nice amount of indica relaxation. I was able to smoke this and work with...”"

nat4weed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1581041,"“Loved it! Grown by House of Cultivar. So much juicy orange flavor! I was impressed. And the high was perfect- psychedelic and happy. Bye-bye, anxiety! A pleasure to smoke.”"
MonkeyBiz28,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1271740,"“Very good for sleep man I ate a bowl of some chicken soup then smoked half a joint of this and was good for the night and I'm talking like 7:30pm lmao put me out for a good five solid hours digging this wonderful skunk.”"
potsampler,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1274381,"“Smelled like oranges but the taste didn't carry over.  Bowl burned black and smoke was pretty harsh.  Effects were very mild and short lived. Probably won't get this particular strand again because of all the other options in the store.”"

Kenny420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1069861,"“I'm so happy to see this strain finally added to Leafly! My regular neighborhood dispensary carries it quite frequently, and the owner has told me it's a customer favorite. I can certainly understand why, as a few fat buds of Orange Skunk always bring a smile to my face. :) This strain is named appropriately, as it is both very skunky (use a Stink Sack!) and very orange-y (the citrus half of this hybrid is definitely...”"
Kush20,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1277536,"“Let's get one thing straight...it tastes nothing like oranges. In fact it's a bit harsh. Overall great chilled high. You'll enjoy this better with company rather than sitting alone watching T.V. Despite it feeling a little more india dominant, you can still get stuff done, depending on your mindset. Watch out for the munchies though, they usually sudden onset, but easy to repel with mints.”"
shayla916,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1147545,"“live this strain. one of my favorites. smoke it when I'm stressed out and feel amazing afterward.”"
cd1990,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1473474,"“Nice strain for relaxation. A good after workout strain, nice body high. Very pungent, and smooth.”"
GreenQueen11,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1238992,"“I expected little from this to be honest. But I have to say the body high is very nice. Almost worth the atrocious dry, itcy irritated eyes that come along with it. I'll go with Bubba or Master or coma over this if I want a good indica because that is I could feel. Almost no sativa effect for me. It's a much better than average relief on the body however, I just can't get past the eye annoyance.”"
shastameds,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-skunk/reviews/1277449,"“Beautiful dense green sparkly nugs with bright orange hairs make this a pleasure to gaze upon...smell IS orangey skunky goodness, and the flavor carries through till the last hit.  Great medicine for pain relief and relaxation with no dry red eyes for me, as others have mentioned.”"
