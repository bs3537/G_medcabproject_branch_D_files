Beautiful green color with some nice hairs and crystals (frost) intertwined. The smell is amazing...like lemon pledge, with a kind of a cedar accent but nice and citrusy.

maktown,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-frost/reviews/1417402,"‚ÄúDefinitely one of the stronger strains I've tried. It hits you in phases.
(1) the first phase is that overall feeling of being lost ‚Äì‚Äì I.e. feeling scatter brained without direction
(2) the second stage is this catatonic lethargic floating stage
(3) third stage is ultra horny-ness... awesome strain to have sex on
(4) good night sleepy head.‚Äù"
UrsaMajor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-frost/reviews/1394607,"‚ÄúAn utter delight. A deep, pine green bud that warrants a double take. So humble at first, the richness of the hue is dark, and deep, but not dim. Almost glossy. Green suede, or a holly wreath.

The shade is curious, but the smell is where you really begin to understand. Lavender, lemon, and heady pine make a crisp perfume, far and away from any "skunky" or "sour" notes.

I smoked a 3.5 gram blunt to the dome in a sticky sweet swisher cigarillo wrap and to my comprehension this strain had a very piney Forrest taste that I found quite enjoyable with a cup of coffee a overall great strain good one to call in sick and drink coffee on the porch.‚Äù"
