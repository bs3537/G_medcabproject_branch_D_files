Blue Mystic
=============
frkfors,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-mystic/reviews/1410705,"“Wow. This must be the best weed I have ever smoked! After the first bong hit, I almost instantly felt a sensation of tingling and numbness at the same time in my fingers, the same feeling of being given strong pain medication intravenously. After the second hit, a strong headhigh kicked in almost instantly. I felt a tingling sensation at the top of my head.
 As I walked in to my livingroom, everything seemed very sur...”"

I love running and after this, I wanted to run to the other side of the world.    It was like I drank 5l of coffee or something. I think this weed should be named Wake'n'Bake 'cause it's fuckin' booster. Don't get this if you want to chill at your house watchin' movies n' shit. 7/10”"

Slicendice,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-mystic/reviews/1410709,"“Large fluffy buds, grey green with light blue tinge. Very sticky with dusting of Trichomes. The taste and smell is very earthy with subtle note of blueberry, especially when consumed with a vape. The high is a real nice blend of a mentally stimulating Sativa and a warm and relaxing Indica. 

Overall a very recommended strain, great to look at and great to smoke.”"

Had it in Holland along with countless other strains, but everything else we smoked ended up being compared to BM's mystical appeal.

Deitab,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-mystic/reviews/1384863,"“I got Blue Mystic due to the reviews on Leafly and it did not dissapoint!  Much like the effects of Plat GSC or Blue Dream... a very nice body and head high, a little more on the sativa side which is great for socializing or being with your sweetie.  Hubby and i got the giggles for a bit.  This strain is very uplifting and will help bring you out of any bad feelings or depression.  A top 10 for me for sure!”"
