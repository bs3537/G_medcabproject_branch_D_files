My body was sedated and all my muscles were completely relaxed. Their is definitely a couch lock effect, but it is also a good sativa buzz as well so the come down isn't bad at all.

IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chemnesia/reviews/1554417,"“Super strong sativa leaning hybrid with an overpowering diesel chem citrus scent. Type of stuff you can still smell in a sealed jar you thought was airtight... Hits like a truck with an uplifting mental buzz and gets your mind racing.
