jurassiccat,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-confidential/reviews/1418673,"‚ÄúEven though it's a pure indica, LA Confidential remains a fantastic all-around strain. Great as an inspiration for devouring food, watching a movie, or laughing conspiratorially with friends.

I think LA Confidential's best attribute is its ability to eliminate stress. It will have you feeling like a hungry, happy, melting pad of butter without inducing couchlock.‚Äù"
BrettKBG,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-confidential/reviews/1416563,"‚ÄúThis is a phenomenal indica for its versatility.  While the body buzz is the focal point of this strain there's also a slight psychedelic head high that's great.  There are few indica's I've experienced that carry this much euphoria it's wonderful, I felt as if I was floating a foot above the couch.  I'll also add this is a nice daytime indica due to low levels of sedation. 10/10‚Äù"

Moto_Joe,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-confidential/reviews/1392602,"‚ÄúOverall, LA Confidential is a well-rounded strain that delivers a fast-approaching sensation that is both psychedelic and super calming on the mind and body. For newer patients seeking relief, LA Confidential can both lull you to sleep and treat acute pain.‚Äù"

SkullyOrganics,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-confidential/reviews/1359879,"‚ÄúThis strain right here is a Classic. Calms to the core. The taste pallet is truly unique, offering a pungent, danky, piney, citrus that you cannot mistake. Once you smoke it you don't forget it. LA Confidential is a very well rounded strain that seems to be the perfect fit for any situation. Pick this one up if your seasoned or a newbie smoker alike.‚Äù"

TheHappyCanadian,https://www.leafly.com/indica/la-confidential/reviews/1381273,"‚ÄúMellow is the word with this one.  Vaping this can even taste a bit marshmallowy at times, and the effect is best characterized as mellowing.  It combines a potent body high with some nice cerebral qualities.  Conversation flows easily with this strain, and my wife and I have had some pretty thoughtful and productive conversations on it.  Not the strongest strain I've tried, but a nicely balanced one.

LA Confidentia...‚Äù"

After some debate, I narrowed my favorites down to this and Purple Urkel.  Great bud for medical purposes like nausea, pain, headaches, etc.  But, also just a great "Anytime" bud.  It won't make you nearly as sleepy as the purple indica buds, but it will clear your mind and ease any sense of discomfort.  Great for daytime or nighttime.‚Äù"
