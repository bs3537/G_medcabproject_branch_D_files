I tried this strain a couple years back and all I can remember is that i couldn't stop laughing. If you're looking for somethong to just kick back and chill this might not be a good option for you. It has a strong odor smell as well.”"
erlindh,https://www.leafly.com/indica/eastern-european/reviews/1562479,"“i have tried this strain a couple of years ago. I'm an Indica fan and this was nothing what i expected to be. The taste was harsh and it didn't smell that nice compared to other strains. 
Some of the effects:
1. It makes you extremely talkative.
2. It makes you very hungry.
3. You won't be able to stop laughing.

If you're looking for something just to kick back and chill this might not be the best option for you.”"
