Green Line OG
=============
OGMisterKush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1586490,"“I really like the way this strain slowly creeps on you. I took a few hits of the live budder from my vaporizer. Great taste and smell, I instantly felt a small buzz that slowly turned into some sort of soft and cozy cerebral blanket. I have smoked for years and years and my tolerance is very high, yet this strain still gave me a feeling of tunnel vision. This lasted me a few hours then slowly faded into a nice bodily...”"
Johnny6speed,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1487657,"“I have smoked many different strains, but pain relieving effects, the mood elevation, the just all around feeling of pure bliss is UNMATCHED! No paranoia, just POWERFUL pain killing properties that match the abilities opiates have. The great thing is that it's not synthesized heroin like opiates are. Just a delicious and all natural medication that KOs pain like Mike Tyson”"
riff610,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1604878,"“Really great quality concentrate.  PA medical grade from Cresco labs.  Very clean quality, very over the top flavorful.  A drier waxy crumble like texture, a bit more difficult to work with than some more waxy concentrates i have had.  Purity though is very impressive.  

Taste wise it's very lime oriented, very fruity and very fragrant.  The effect is surprisingly strong and very clear.  My body feels relaxed but no...”"
Heavyhanded,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1589812,"“Truly delightful hybrid. Definitely straddles that 50/50 line but without the sometimes confusing/competing nuances of say a GSC or Kosher Tangie. Rather than feeling the distinct effects of both sativa/indi lineage, the two opposing ends of the spectrum seem to harmonize and even synergize into a very comfortable and unique headspace and state of relaxation. Also absent of that mental haze that sometimes accompanies...”"

Judotapout,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1487993,"“Love this stuff. Just melts my amputee pain away.....so does thunder cookies. So try both of these potant strains. I got this one at disp its 31percent. The thunder ciokies are 26 percent.”"
TheUnready,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1467735,"“I think this strain is pretty remarkable.  The effect is potent and very warm/happy with an energetic attitude.  A nice smoke as well (to me that mostly means mellow).”"

CaptainQuazar,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1762269,"“Green Line OG sugar concentrate from Cresco is a true delight. Easy to vape, didn't induce coughing, very smooth. Has a sweet, green kool-aid flavor that delivers a crisp & clean buzz, like a bell ringing in your head. Instant tingly relaxation. Pairs with Little Drummer Girl.”"
Cabassa18,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1718748,"“Very uplifting. Also brings focus. Good day time strain!”"
TheBlackYellow,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1745326,"“Such an incredible strain needs to be consumed with care due to it's very high THC/THCA percentage.  Using this in a vape pen with budder, at nearly 80% THC, is a two second hitter and waiter.

Relax, let it come to you, and sure as hell, don't chase it.  This is even stronger than Cindy 99 and in moderation can give you a perfect daytime plan; you remain very focused and diligent.

It creates a "step up" from what i...”"

We are not yet able to get flowers here yet, but we do have dabs ! Cresco released a "reserve" line of live budder. The Green Line OG is amazing ! It is most definitely worth the extra 15 to 20 dollars to go top shelf. The Terps are out if this world when dabbed at a lower temperature. The flavor is...”"
CNTruehart,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1685097,"“I heard about this from someone who was a heavy smoker and thought this was amazing. I’m not a heavy smoker so I figured it would last longer for me. He was correct on how good is was! It’s great for during the day and keeping you moving. I’d definitely get this again.”"

BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1759016,"“This strain surprised me...
THC: 82%
Form: Live sugar
Brand: Cresco

I've noticed Ghost OG as one of the parents, and also noticed it's popularity however it never did much for me.  Adding Lime Skunk to it did something to make it far more effective for me.  It feels euphoric, relaxing, you can focus easily, and it gets rid of any stress.”"
CF998,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1793210,"“Clears the head, gives a jump shot of energy and clarity when dabbing concentrate that slows into a steady, just comfort of mind and soul. No anxiety or worry about a thing.  A feeling of whatever happens whenever it won’t be a big deal and everything is groovy. Me like a lot.”"
wgibbs83,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1794634,"“Nice head high that's relaxing. I purchased this as a live sugar and its oh so tasty. One of my favorites of cresco's.”"
kushopz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1787534,"“Has a "green" smell, but the live sugar doesn't have the dank punch like some of the other brands. A lot of Cresco's products lack in that area. Buzz is ok, creeper for sure.”"
Fossberg666,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1785128,"“Had the Cresco Reserve Live Sugar. It was right around 85% total thc. Very terpy, good flavor. Gave me a nice head high, with a bit of energy. all together some awesome stuff. Only negative I have is mine was a little too runny.”"

As a seasoned smoker with a high tolerance, one dab of this wrapped my pained shoulders in warmth and fuzziness. My pain is subsiding as I write this and I feel like I may have had some coffee, almost reminds me of the buzz I get from Green Crack. The taste is very similar. But I feel like I could sit and have a conversation...”"

Definitely makes it into my favorite strain book for sure! definitely eases my Multiple sclerosis symptoms and helped my body and mind relax. Noticed no anxiety what-so-ever and it almost felt like I was wrapped in a warm blanket, without a worry in the world! High five to Cresco for this one! 👏👍😊”"
nicagreen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/green-line-og/reviews/1778333,"“Green Line OG is a beautiful strain. I tried the moon rocks version of it. It tastes like limes and Earth honoring both of it's parents. It's relaxing without being too sedating. The Sativa genetics improve your focus. 

To make the best of this strain. Smoke it before you go out. Put a bottle of Green line Goose island in a paper bag and take a ride on the Green line.”"
