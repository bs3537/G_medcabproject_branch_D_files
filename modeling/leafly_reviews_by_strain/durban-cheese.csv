The buds are compact while still soft to touch and upon cutting them up, they release into soft and subtly sticky grounds. The pull from my bong's bowl was even and enjoyable and the taste was true to the Leafly description - Lemon and blue cheese, with what I'll add as earthy undertones. The high is stimul...”"

edubb4daze,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/durban-cheese/reviews/1349017,"“Very good and relaxing high as described here as it would be. Very mellow and easy going. Head high was slight for me and more of a body high.”"

It doesn’t hit me heavy like some other hybrid strains. True to its name which pays homage to its lineage. You get the relaxing effects of the Cheese with the euphoria of the Durban Poison. I prefer each plant by themselves, but Durban Cheese is good for cooking or folding laundry.”"

ThomasHC,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/durban-cheese/reviews/1202946,"“It's been a while since I have actually smoked Durban Cheese, but I had good experiences with it. It wasn't the most potent (or at least the buds I had), but it definitely didn't feel like it was lacking either.”"

excellent body high with a relaxing come-down”"
EpiphanyPause,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/durban-cheese/reviews/1603105,"“This bud is light green and airy in appearance. Has a really nice lemon citrus smell with an undertone if smokey cheese. Flowers are sparse in growing structure, giving it a soft feel to the touch and a nondusty crumble. Smoked in a bowl, Durban Cheese has a pleasant earthy taste with a natural lemon finish. Don’t expect to get big high unless it’s your wake and bake option. Ideal for cleaning laundry, walking the do...”"

I have smoked this several times when I was just trying to chill and enjoy the day and it didn't really blow my mind. It didn't calm me down and wasn't ridiculously uplifting so I looked at it as a waste. 

HOWEVER. Now that I'm laid up in bed, my uterus is waging war on my body (consider yourselves lucky men), I'm nauseous and feel...”"

Smells funky but it's a good relaxing hybrid but also get very talkative. Helps with our stress and depression. Helps with my arm pain also. We enjoy this strain.”"

JaneCannabisDoe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/durban-cheese/reviews/1677076,"“Where do I even start... This strain has provided me with the most powerful and effective pain relief of almost any strain I've ever used. It was not what I was expecting yet it was everything I wanted, needed and more... After one puff I had approximately 25% reduction in migraine... Halfway through the joint I felt almost brand new again after two full days of struggling with this awful headache. If you can get you...”"

nweil1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/durban-cheese/reviews/1062689,"“I don't think I've ever been happier than when on this strain. As soon as I realized the bud actually smelled like cheese I didn't stop laughing for a good hour and a half, which pissed off my friends. I did smoke a very large quantity compared to them, which would explain the more extreme high, but no regrets, this was an amazing experience. Didn't get anxious once during the high and had no bad thoughts.”"
