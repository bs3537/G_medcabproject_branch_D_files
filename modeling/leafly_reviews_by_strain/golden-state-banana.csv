That is by far the highest claim I have heard to date and it’s stamped on the side of the package (can)...Paper planes is a respectable lab and the cans come sealed too, anyway you could tell the quality right away from the fruity/skunky pungent smell that came wafting up when I popped the top to the fluo...”"

Emceemayo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/golden-state-banana/reviews/1563876,"“Absolutely phenomenal strain. Washington certainly didn't disappoint with this one. Fruity, relaxing, strong, and somehow still energizing and subtle. I thoroughly enjoyed this strain in the morning as well as the evening. The nugs weren't too large but were dense and generous, and the taste was incredible. Nothing but wonderful things to say about this strain.”"
BigDabbyStrain,https://www.leafly.com/indica/golden-state-banana/reviews/1581228,"“Some of the sexiest buds I’ve ever held, bright green and so pungent-the side of this can claims 30.5% thc...is that even possible in a flower form??? I don’t smoke very much flower anymore but I couldn’t resist this heavy hitter, absolutely floored me!!! Indica indica indica!!! Loved the can it came in!!! Packaged and most definitely grown with quality in mind!”"
rainbowcrash,https://www.leafly.com/indica/golden-state-banana/reviews/1574404,"“Holy crap.
I typically have to smoke somewhere between a whole joint to a whole blunt to feel decent effects from a strain.
This took a single tiny rip off some of my glass.
Still creeping up on me almost half an hour after I smoked.
I'm melting into my bed, ready for one hell of a night's sleep.
Easily my new favorite before bed strain.
I suffer from severe chronic insomnia and this is exactly what I need.
Bought at...”"

Xandi87,https://www.leafly.com/indica/golden-state-banana/reviews/1547310,"“Taste: fruity, sweet, lemon-banana candy-like with notes of earth and tobacco. Taste a bit artificial in my opinion.
Effects: creeping high; combination of indica and satire effects, very tingly body feeling!”"
