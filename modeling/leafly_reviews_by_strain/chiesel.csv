Vomit,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/chiesel/reviews/1413625,"“AMAZING high. The first time I made a true connection with my guitar was on Chiesel. You feel so in tune with your work, your art, your words, your universe. This strain really gets your blood pumping, and is sure to make you say "Oh, man" the first time around. It leaves its tracks in your mouth, so be prepared to have a sour, cheesey taste on your  tongue for a while after.

Musicians and artists should be sure to ...”"

No anxiety/paranoia (must for me). Body high allowed me to eat lunch. Head high was energetic & focused. Dis one not a sleeper for me. High lasted 3 + hours which was great!

A little paranoia after smoking most a joint but nothing too major just my pets is playing and wind is blowing. Music is wonderful. I could also get it on with my wife if she in the mood.”"

It is the strongest smelling wax I have ever used. Even sealed, it makes my room smell kind of like salami. The inhale and exhale is kind of earthy and cheesy.

The only reason I gave this strain 4 stars is because it has a weird onion/garlic aftertaste. I know it's not sulfur because the wax is lab tested.”"
