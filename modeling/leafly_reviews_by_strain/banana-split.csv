BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-split/reviews/1725535,"“This strain is absolutely incredible.
Brand: Rhythm wax
THC:  81%

The taste alone is insanely delicious, it is a very mellow productive high. Perfect for any time of day, won't trigger any anxiety for those prone to it who are afraid to try a sativa or sativa dominant hybrid.
I try not to rate everything 5 stars, and I haven't given a solid 5 in awhile.  After a couple hundred strains I've tried I think this is my n...”"

drummerbaker,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-split/reviews/1734136,"“very tasty, and pleasant high. but I feel like it gives me a groggy weed hangover and headache the next day.”"
CupidRon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-split/reviews/1733285,"“Definitely can feel the effects of both the Sativa and the indica in this. It has a nice upper but keeps you in that nice relaxed state. It is very potent too! I love it.”"
seanzy84,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-split/reviews/1733535,"“one of my favorite strains I've ever tried out of hundreds of strains. tastes and smells very similar to original cali-o or super chess but with a hint of fruit not just orange tangerine. usually get from Purlife in Albuquerque. normally tests from 16-26%. Good anytime smoke, great for depression, anxiety, pain, etc. one of the most sweetest smelling strains out there in my opinion. seems to be a pretty close 50/50 h...”"
BowenIsland,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-split/reviews/1736043,"“Banana Split is definitely a beginner's strain, made by Aurura with a THC level of 15.2%.  Best way to describe the overall experience from this Satival leaning Hybrid was "Gentle".  It had a mild and almost subdued tropical / banana flavor.  The initial euphoria gently eased in without fanfare. I noticed a slight uplift in my mood and maintained a clear head  - I could easily focus on any task.  If you want a bit mo...”"

SeanMac26,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-split/reviews/1734395,"“Great body stone with hard to deny happy feelings. Has a 2nd kick that’s different than the initial high, more physically euphoric.”"
arbie03,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-split/reviews/1741054,"“Moderate dose gives me a good high that’s right in between indica and sativa. Truly a hybrid.

Heavy dose makes me pretty sleepy and will have me feeling groggy the day after. The indica effects are much more dominant when using a heavier dose”"

Brendawg,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-split/reviews/1803150,"“I personally don't care for this strain it almost leaves me feeling normal I get more of a body high kind of feeling without the pain relief I also find it doesn't help me sleep either.”"

Smellslikeog,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-split/reviews/1793117,"“very high yield when using pruning techniques. she will brush out and create ALOT of donkey dicks if pruned enough in early veg. she's a fast growing plant that will get big if wanted. great for indoor or outdoor. overall banana split is a must have in your garden!”"
chiefbigbong,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-split/reviews/1745094,"“A great sativa hybrid that adds a gentle body high to otherwise sativa-leaning effects. Energizing but still relaxing rather than racy or speedy. Great for casual daytime activities and gaming. I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because, even at 18% thc, I found the head high to be a little mild for my taste.”"

opened my sealed jar excited to smell fruity, flowery potent weed, instead it smelt like walking into a barn that is hang drying standard outdoor. Not a pleasant smell. earthy, floral, hay like smell.

The taste was ok... It tasted better than it smelt that's for sure but it wasn't banana or fruity in anyway. just typical floral, earthy toke.

The Buds were pretty sad looking too lol.. fa...”"
