I live with ptsd and this was a nice one to puff on all day but I do smoke a lot and have a higher tolerance so perhaps to much for the novice user.  Not helping me get off the couch but didn’t make me want to stay here for to long lol give it a try! You will not be disappointed!”"

IceBoneKillah,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cowboy-kush/reviews/1500184,"“Really pungent mix of piney sweet chemmy Diesel scent, comes right through the dispensary bag. No hiding this stuff. Cerebral and relaxing, found it to be a lot like Headband all the way down to that same creeping pressure you get behind the eyes. Strong, even for a daily smoker, can end your day if you over do it.”"
cocod7,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cowboy-kush/reviews/1643330,"“Great strain for when you have pain during the day and don’t have much access to CBD. A few hits and the pain goes away, but you still feel functional, productive and able to focus. If you’re able to combine it with Cherry Wine it’ll be even better.”"
