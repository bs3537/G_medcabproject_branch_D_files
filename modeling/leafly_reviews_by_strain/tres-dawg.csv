Tres Dawg
=============
stonergirl1428,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tres-dawg/reviews/1359999,"“So for some reason at my dispensary (well in all of Ct) they can't use "street strain names,) like Sour diesel, or OG kush. So they call this #25,violet-but in reality it's tres dawg. Anyways great strain, especially if you're an indica lover(like me.) it's actually a hybrid but definitely an indica dominant one.  A little goes a long way with this strain. Relaxing, helps with pain(I shattered my ankle in a really ba...”"

I would probably not use this strain during the day. Get this if you can find it and you love good strong bud.”"
BurninateDabs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tres-dawg/reviews/1496769,"“So first of all I was reading over the effects here and it says uplifting & energetic. I would have to go ahead & say no that isn't the case. It's definitely a strong leaning indica hybrid.
Form: Shatter
Brand: HYH Society
THC: 74%

Trees dawg is worth a try & I guess it's sort of rare?

Smell 5/5
 It smells like my grandma's house. Or my friends basement. A definite maybe moldy smell but not in a bad way? I like the...”"

stonergirl1428,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tres-dawg/reviews/1263588,"“Great strain, I'd give it a 4.5 but I can't so a 5. At my dispensary they call it violet/25 since in Ct our dispensarys can't use "street names." Ridiculous, since the pharmacist tells me anyway. Great indica, if you can get your hands on it, I suggest you do. Super high thc content(mine tested at 25.3%) long lasting, relaxing high. Definitely in my top 10.”"
mutterbilk,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tres-dawg/reviews/1349749,"“This is a SUPER potent strain! It's sticky, it smells pungent - but it's a goooood pungent :) One small bowl and i'm soaring. This review has taken about 10 minutes to type up... 

If you already have some kind of nervousness or paranoia, this strain will amplify it.

The highness feels like its radiating from my eyes and chest. I'm very tingly. Like a post orgasm”"

DaBinx,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tres-dawg/reviews/1263589,"“Very sweet sour diesel chemdawg taste. Less hashy than headband. Really flavorful. Offers a medium sativa high with heavy indica stone. One of the best mixes of diesel flavor. This strain is very strong and the oil is amazing. If you are lucky enough to find this strain get it.”"

JamesPR,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tres-dawg/reviews/1727073,"“Good weed, nice relaxing body and head high and cures loss of appetite easily. Can definitely feel the Indica effects quite a bit too through sleepiness. High THC content so not much needed to get you blasted.”"
TiberiusCT,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tres-dawg/reviews/1263920,"“4.5 CT Strain Violet by Curaleaf. This one was so smooth, more of Indica then hybrid I would say with a very quick onset of body tingling and then face got numb very quick and on hour 2 still feeling great. Making me sleepy as well which is what I want. Would not be productive on this guy.”"
captaindabs710,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tres-dawg/reviews/1300715,"“I've only tried the Shatter and wow this strain will put any veteran smoker to sleep. Also works great with pain. Only down side is if you smoke to much and fight the sleep you can easily get paranoid.”"

Organtica is a new dispensary just opened on the 28th of October of 2016. I am really excited for this dispensary because of the different strains they are having from strains I've never seen nor heard like "Polar Ice Cap" is one and they also have DJ Shorts Actual blueberry from DJ short himself.
