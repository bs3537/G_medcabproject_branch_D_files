With that, it definitely has a little more kick than others I have had like Cannatonic and Harlaquin. Smells amazing, tastes great and gives a nice light buzz while leaving me feeling very functional. Nice little body buzz action. I use high CBD because I get anxiety and so far this strain has been pretty good to me.”"

Wow.  sweet & sour on the tongue. expansive smoke. nice, full-body relaxation with a very mild head buzz. perfect for a mellow, rainy day in or a night of Netflix.  this one made me a bit too relaxed for functional daytime activities.  but I love it for everything else!”"

The phenotype you want to get, that the folks who work at WHTC will tell you, is called Blood Orange Cookies. That's the best version of this strain, Mai Tai Cookies. It's almost the same, just slightl...”"

Super fruity smell, chalk on my finger tips. Hues of purple underneath the heavily frosted bud. Top 5 for the year for me.”"

This is possibly the best high CBD strain out there. For those of us that need a little more THC than your average 1:1 delivers, this is it. 

This is perfect on a cart so you can take it with you and hit it through the day, especially with a battery you can adjust the strength level on - sometimes you want more, sometimes less. It gives a decent little head high (a.k.a. Out-in-public high) but the ...”"
