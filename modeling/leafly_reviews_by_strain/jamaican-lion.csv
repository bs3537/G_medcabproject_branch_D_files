Jamaican Lion
=============
Audio_Geek,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-lion/reviews/1368027,"“Simply a magical strain.  Jamaican Lion is a Godsend. 

One of the few times that I can honestly say that I agree with the writeup in the Strain Highlights section entirely. 

I am giving this strain a 10/10, as I feel that it is perfect. 

If you have anxiety, it will lift it away with no paranoia. 
Jamaican Lion will leave you happy and uplifted, all while being able to focus.  It feels like my usual manic state ha...”"
Orbweaver,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-lion/reviews/1353520,"“High CBD! This is the best medical strain I've used. An excellent medical smoke. Quickly takes away moderate pain, anxiety, etc for hours with only a mild "high" that fades after 30 minutes to leave behind a relaxed, completely functional feeling. Highly recommend as a day smoke. Best results (medically) are by vape; smoked is more intoxicating. Dose is easy to titrate, take as little or as much as you need. A good n...”"
dtavit1,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-lion/reviews/1353522,"“Jamaican Lion is the shit, I can't stress it more. With almost 18% THC and nearly 8% CBD this strain is heaven to smoke. This sativa will give you a head full of energy and creativity as well as a strong uplifting effect. The CBD in this strain will sneak up on you as well, curing anxiety and pain without you knowing.”"

Great mood lifter, stress-buster, pain-reliever, and all around relaxing strain.  Very good for chilling with friends without being dumb or checked-out.  Very satisfying head+body strain - doesn't affect your focus too much but will make you lazy.”"
bayvegan420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-lion/reviews/1359877,"“High CBD, great for anxiety. Leaves a little of a buzzy feeling, but it fades after half an hour or so, then leaves you relaxed so you can get things done. 10/10 would recommend.”"
Echolalia,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-lion/reviews/1355758,"“This is one of my absolute favorite strains. Good for headaches but even better for anxiety, ADHD & depression. There's a little bit of a buzz but not enough to interfere with day-to-day life.”"

I smoked at least 4 fat J's a day and wa...”"

My arms felt sorta tingly but my whole body was relaxed almost instantly. My mind felt clear and ready to focus on whatever I threw at it. It wasn't foggy or an "oh shit I'm really high" kind of high, and I smoked quite a bit (out of a bong). I just felt very at ease and SUPER confident and open minded and was totally anxiety free. I...”"

Irie' revelations, forwarded creativity and focus with adequate functionality, would forward with this bud a second time, sharpened perceptions, motivation increase, give thanks”"
chronic.cooking,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-lion/reviews/1377092,"“I got the CBD variant from Starbuds Kelowna. This stuff works very, very well on pain. It handled my breakthrough pain like a champ, and helped a bit with my sore back too. 

Head-wise, it's a clear-headed high; you don't have to worry about being clouded on this stuff unless you take a high dose. It did make me a little anxious when I smoked a lot of it in one sitting, but that's easily avoided by smoking less! You ...”"
peruoblemchild,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-lion/reviews/1333018,"“Keeps you cool and calm just like Jamaica. A stoney, steady high but definitely mellow. Very uplifting, fun, and completely functional if a bit sleepy towards the end. Mellow yellow indeed.”"

Great for beating the blues on cloudy days and also probably  helpful in helping to treat full-on depression (you would use other tools to treat it as well, ideally).  And I love that this Sativa has a good bit of CBD in it as well. The buds I tried were 6% CBD and 10% THC. It has a really decent but chill head trippy buzz even with that little THC. I guess I'm tr...”"

chronic.cooking,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-lion/reviews/1377094,"“This stuff does wonders on pain. It handles my breakthrough pain like a champ and keeps my baseline lower. 

It's a very clear-headed high; you don't have to worry about being non-functional on this stuff unless you take too high of a dose.

I got a little bit anxious when I smoked too much, so I wouldn't recommend it for someone with anxiety.”"
Lmcali73,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-lion/reviews/1335788,"“First time ever trying it. i have arthritis and i am in pain everyday all day. It gave me the sensation of being on a cloud. i was pain free for 2 hours. I usually wake up during the night and i feel tired the next morning, I was a ble to sleep all night. i am glad i tried it.”"

djdaveathome,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-lion/reviews/1347690,"“Very herbal and sweet. At times I taste tropical fruit, the next moment it's some kind of exotic tobacco flavour.
It is an uplifting high that can put you in 'The Zone'. Focus, creativity.
Wonderful daytime varietal.”"
