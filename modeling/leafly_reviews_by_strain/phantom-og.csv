I just got more and more blazed feeling. I feel toasted. Squinted feeling to my eyes, very heavy head feeling and stoned in my brain feeling. I feel slow as heck in my mind. I feel focused at the same time. I don't know about the taste. It tastes like really good clean bud. Just good delicious clean meds. Great stuff. I just ...”"
John18,https://www.leafly.com/indica/phantom-og/reviews/1230212,"“Surprisingly sweet tasting and smooth, Phantom OG is a strong Indica  that comes on with a whisper, and ends with a roar.  Phantom OG is best reserved for a lazy evening, or as a sleep aid, for its effects are uplifting for the first 30 minutes, then prepare for an inner-eyelid examination or a nice R.E.M. session.”"

The buzz happened in 5 mins, but after 20 I was toast. Very good strain I would recommend this to all. Great for stress and anxiety, and the pain reliever in it is sweet.”"
