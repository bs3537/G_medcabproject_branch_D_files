This underrated gem is a proper night time med.  As a sufferer of ulcerative colitis, Black D helps to keep the cramping down and kill the pain, stress and anxiety associated with chronic illness. This allows for a peaceful nights rest when it is needed most.

Overall a very effective tool for helping to combat the hellish effects of disease.  It allows one to ease ...”"

What really sets this strain apart is the powerful, narcotic euphoria that comes with a BD high. The feeling is like nothing else, but it has similarities with opiates. The body starts with euphoric waves radiating from the center of your chest, your eyes, your forearms, etc. Sex is far more pleasurabl...”"

reviewmaster,https://www.leafly.com/indica/black-domina/reviews/1261896,"“Definitely a unique strain. The fragrance is rather pleasing. This is the first strain that I picked up that ever had a scent of ground black pepper or spices. 
The effects are fairly average. Very good strain for those that are new to cannabis. If you want potent strains I recommend True OG kushes.”"
