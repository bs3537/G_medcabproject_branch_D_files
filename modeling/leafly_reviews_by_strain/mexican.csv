I live 100 miles from the Mexican border and this was the only weed I knew. Layers of compressed shitty bud filled with seed.I grew up on it. 
It's been a long time since I've smoked me some Reggie so about a week ago while I was low on cash I decided to buy and ounce. ( lol 60$) 
This Reggie reeked of skunky ...”"

I was telling him how good Marijuana was in Czech Republic and how it was much better than Mexican Brick Weed.

He told me he had some really good Mexican Land Race Sativa grown in the mountains o...”"

For those of you who started on Mexican, the buzz is very unique. Mostly in the face and very very euphoric. Not all of it has a bad taste. It just depends on the person you know and how close the connection is to the border. Most of the Mexican that I have gotten has been compressed, but sometimes you can get some fat round nugs a...”"

The best and most famous California Sativa Hybrids and mix Sativas have Mexican Sativa origin, since 1960's us residents have taken seeds to us to grow and breed mostly in NC, the most famous one Golden Acapulco, but believe me golden Acapulco is not the best Mexican Sativa around. Most of Me...”"

It's dry and full of seeds but .5-.7 of this will have you feeling pretty good. Can't be the general price on it either ($5 a gram $75 an ounce where I live). Good for saving money”"

The high is the perfect mix of relaxing and energetic with extreme heavenly euphoria and absolutely no paranoia whatsoever. Amazing visual crispness and clarity that makes you just want to stare at your shiny cell phone app or go out and explore nature. Good social high. This is one of the best medica...”"

A lot of plants become pollinated and become hermaphrodites which is the reason Mexican swag has seeds in it. That effects the thc levels and/or the quality of the flower.

Great God gifted strain”"

However I would bet if grown well it would be quite similar to landrace Acapulco Gold.”"

I'm very close to the border of Mexico so it is easy and cheap to find, $40 an ounce, $350 a pound. always very bricked bit some batches are very lime green with few seeds and will do the trick pretty good. I won't buy this weed but it is worth trying a grow if u find some nice seeds in a good batch.”"

Smooth smoke, nice buzz, nothing heavy or trippy yet it just. hits the spot for me. I even get a pleasant sleep from it. I have Oaxacan/Early Iranian seeds coming from Oregon Green Seed, I can't wait to see what I get from them.”"
25yearvet,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mexican/reviews/1607079,"“Trying to bring up the curve.  We all know about the garbage that comes in bricks and has God knows what in it or on it.  However, real Mex is not awful and definitely beats some of these "elegant" strains for it's effect.  I think it's really a 4 of 5 but just hate to see it get bashed because of it's typical appearance and smoke quality due to the trade.”"
Jrodriguez214,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/mexican/reviews/1709739,"“Not the strongest, but a fairly good high; however,the exact "strain" usually depends on how deep in Mexico you are. Like most people have said, indigenous marijuana plants in Latin America were "sativa", so that would explain the "head-high", yet there is a decent body high. Now, while in Mexico and in the States, I've had some straight up Mexican Reggie. But once in Zacatecas, after a while of asking around and eve...”"
