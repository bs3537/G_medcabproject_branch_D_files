Similar to what I get when I smoke Headband or J1, but with an OG/Kushy twist.  Great for chilling out, laughing, music, or movies.  Ends with a gentle nudg...”"

Laying in bed talking, that's when I felt the "face off." I felt and saw my face talking about a foot in front of my head. Totally crazy but awesomely euphoric. New favorite but only for home and nightime.”"
