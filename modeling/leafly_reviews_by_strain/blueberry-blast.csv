Sofakingbad.420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1375404,"“Just purchased from my local dis. in Nor-Cal "True blueberry smell I enjoy the aroma, taste and overall high, good smooth head high / body high also good as well. Can still work, be social, creative." " I can recall smoking probably the first strains of this 10+ year ago further north in CA, I recall it having been more potent back then which I find shocking in some ways."

Either way good flower in my opinion, I pur...”"

floydian420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1493267,"“I've been experimenting with smoking less often, and more mindfully lately (not just smoking before bed out of habit), smoking with a purpose. I picked up this sativa on the way home and went for an evening walk around my quiet suburban neighbourhood. The taste of this was delicious, earthy, floral, and obviously some sweet blueberry, and was quite smooth. Before I knew it I was up and walking, enjoying some beautifu...”"

McSplif,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1375399,"“Wow! one of those strains when you first smell a true blueberry blast you will be overwhelmed with the unmistakable smell of sweet blueberries followed by an earthy pungent skunky finish.  Great anytime strain.  not overly sedating, but a great upbeat high. Excellent for daytime use.   I grabbed this from Westcanna in downtown Vancouver and their selection and service is the best around.”"
ForcePower8,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1468461,"“Blueberry Blast certainly “blasted” me, in more way than one. It was a beautiful Seattle day when my best bud and I each smoked a J on a local pier. Immediately after finishing, I noticed a “deepening” of my vision, both in a sense of distance and an enhanced appreciation of my surroundings. The bustling sounds of the city became more apparent and I felt my audio perception was enhanced. Every sound felt more promine...”"
Yonex420,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1410878,"“I gotta begin by stating that this strain is more indica than sativa,IMHO. 
The aroma of sweet berries mixed with coffee and dankness= A good nights sleep,at least for me. Tbis packs a punch on the 1st pull. waves of warm relaxation and in my case a noticeable change in mindframe (racing thoughts and constant wheels churning subsided). also great for muscle aches and joints. This has given me great restful nights of ...”"

kushkobain,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1539002,"“This strain provides the exact kind of high I like in a sativa - potent, psychoactive, uplifting, and long-lasting. As I write this, I’m still basking in the happy and slightly hazy buzz from a joint I smoked 5 hours ago. The bulk of the visual effects remain intact, including the added depth to my surroundings that somehow makes things look more 3D than they already are. I feel relaxed, but not drowsy or sluggish.

pbenz86,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1356995,"“definitely the sweetest smelling strain I've ever had the pleasure of indulging in. very sweet taste and pungent aroma. the high is incredible and knocks you straight on your ass. a more uplifting high. very enjoyable. not for the beginner smoker as after 3 or 4 puffs put me on my ass”"
Vladtheinhaler808,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1648350,"“We just burned one. Beautiful looking bud. The aroma is fruity and rich. The taste was smooth. It left a really wild berry taste in the back of my mouth. The buzz is awesome. Nice feel but able to function. No lethargic feelings but the munchies just hit hard. 

Highly recommend. Top 5 strain.”"
sirsmokealot247,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1548696,"“One of my favorite strains yet, Big buds, like the whole bag, strong blueberry smell. And definitely a sativa, lol.”"
stonerreina,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1669597,"“I like the sweet citrusy scent and the taste of berries in this strain. Got a really bad case of the munchies.”"
Chadd720,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1728646,"“This is an okay, tolerable strain in my book. Very much a sativa. Gives you that antsy feeling.”"
john002,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1266130,"“I really liked it I liked the way it looked and smokes and the help at the dispensary was very wonderful and helpful”"
theonehundredman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1593909,"“It's a virtual pile of blueberries. Like blueberries from concentrate. A little like Blue Dream, but quite different.. there's definitely some haze there... The high is pretty sativa, nothing too crazy - kind of like a less "up" XJ-13. For taste alone this one gets four stars, but there's good energy in this strain. Worth a pickup, for sure.”"
MonkeyBiz28,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1371190,"“Really digging this Sativa very beautiful strain and love the high it gives me its straight to the head wich is what I love and the flavor is excellent.”"
hackenstien421,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/blueberry-blast/reviews/1375403,"“scary.....high. too much. the sativa effects and paranoid thought basis outweigh enjoyment.
not for novice smoker. very high psychoactive feel that outweigh the body buzz”"
