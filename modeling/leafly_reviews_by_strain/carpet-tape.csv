The buds are perfect to look at with a fluffy look yet dense feeling when breaking apart.  Reminds me of chalk or astronaut ice cream in texture that just crumbles into perfect bud for joints, pipes, or bongs.  An all around kind of herb that I imagine is also a tasty concentrate.

It gave me a very heavy body and head high. It also gave me a wicked case of the munchies! I rate Carpet Tape at a 4.”"

The cut I had of this strain was very Indica leaning which I love! Bright green crystalized buds with a very strong skunk glue gas smell. The taste was very earthy with a twinge of glue. Highley recommend this strain if you see it!”"
