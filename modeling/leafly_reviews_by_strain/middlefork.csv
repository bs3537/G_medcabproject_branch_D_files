A pleasantly assertive combination of lime, blueberry, and sweet basil leaf aromas bless the nose - with the lime and sweet basil prominent in the mouth. Expect a SOARING, mildly psychedelic sativa elevation to last for four-plus hours.

Well WOW, this comes on like a freight train, but not hard. It just hits fast but it's like a barrage of clouds. Immediately my pain is gone. It's like being transported. No couch lock unless I want to just hang back a...‚Äù"

Just ripped half a small bowl and damn I'm baked. Reminds me of a more mellow Girl Scout Cookies, just as potent but more body high and less focused head high.

NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/middlefork/reviews/1218157,"‚ÄúMy new favorite. Really enjoy this one at around 30% THC it's strong but no paranoia at all. Very relaxing chill weed but still able to focus and be creative. Looks amazing have never seen the amount of trichomes that this stuff has, crystals on top of crystals, very sticky. The Blueberry flavor is very intense. Just an all around happy relaxing experience. A+‚Äù"

The taste is somewhat tropical and it's sweet to smell. The buds are pretty dense and crystal coated. With the indica side, it completely relaxes the body so it isn't something to use if you want to do a lot but it does make you feel focused‚Äù"

I came into my dispensary and asked for something that can help with shoulder, back pain, also I am recovering from a kidney surgery. I also suffer from ptsd. basically drove most of the pain away and have noticed that it is helping me sleep longer and not be so anxious. gave one star less for ultimate dry mouth that I get from it.‚Äù"
denalus,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/middlefork/reviews/1351822,"‚ÄúOutstanding medical strain for body pain & headaches. Well-balanced hybrid that brings out the best traits of it's parents. Head & body effects quickly wipe away the pain, replacing it with a calming serenity. Likely good for anxiety as well. Excellent for migraines & one of my favourite strains. Highly recommend.‚Äù"
