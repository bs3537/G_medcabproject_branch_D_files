I continually bought this until they ran out. If you ever cross it in your travels you have to buy it. The smell of this bud alone gives you the munchies. It smells delicious and tastes even better.

anth312,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/captain-america-og/reviews/1420942,"“The "Captain" has a lot going for it. Nice balance of body soothing and pain killing with an overall euphoric feeling. There was a nice amount of cerebral stimulation that brought about some deep thinking, left me feeling like I was laying on a marshmellow. Very tasty and smooth flower, little bit sweet an the smoke wasnt too heavy. Overall a very relaxing strain that combats stress and pain.”"

WhoIsTheJMan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/captain-america-og/reviews/1692866,"“Captain America is in fact legit. Doesn't come around often but when it does, let that Captain into your life. Smells like an open spread at a wedding, with all your favourite foods. You can feel the high in your teeth at first as it penetrates your skeleton and slowly morphs you into a superhero. You will have pure energy flowing through your veins yet be in complete control like a ninja. Enjoy.”"
