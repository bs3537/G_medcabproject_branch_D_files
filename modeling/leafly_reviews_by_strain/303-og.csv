kushhqueeen,https://www.leafly.com/indica/303-og/reviews/1413919,"“Picked up some 303 Kush from Livwell on Evans and I love this strain. def a strain I will be keeping close. I'm more of an indica smoker since I've suffered with Anxiety and Panic attacks for years now and this strain didn't trigger any not even anxiousness which is a major plus! Good night time/relax smoke. tried a wake and bake with it and had my ass on sleep mode all day so not a day time strain unless you aren't ...”"
OrdinaryJosh,https://www.leafly.com/indica/303-og/reviews/1369161,"“Seeing 303 is on the menu for $35 1/8th, I immediately ask to see the Colorado classic for the first time. Inhaling out of the jar, my nose is greeted with woody aromas, with the terpenes displaying some earthy/musky undertones on the end of the scent. It's like Ron Swanson in the forest, felling a great evergreen tree. In your nose. 
The appearance is typical hybrid. Though to note specifics, it's leaves are a mediu...”"

I owever didn't find it to have much physical pain relief. Flavor: get ready this is a rollercoaster, but by vaporizing I picked up in this order, a floral woodyness with cheesy/yeasty lemony/citrus. Hard to explain unless Vaped but outs...”"
NoCo970,https://www.leafly.com/indica/303-og/reviews/1327150,"“Found this to be a very enjoyable smoke, one you smoke for the enjoyment of it, if that makes sense...like a cigar. Very social bud for an indica, very heady which is great for migrane/headache relief and didn't find it to be sedating. I found no paranoia in fact quite the opposite. This squashed my PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Overall very minor pain relief in physical form. If your in pain I recommend accompanyin...”"

Organic flavor profile competes somewhat with peanut butter and chocolate and pairs well with pistachio and apple.”"

I'm a veteran hippie (hey, I admit it) that typically prefers a nice Sativa to spark the creative juices, but I also suffer from a number of issues, including severe anxiety and insomnia. I decided to pick this up to kick insomnia square in the tuckus.

Methods used were smoking and vaporizing. Very piney scent - you can smell this from ...”"

And to the point... I use this stain primarily to end my day and for playing the Pokemon Online TCG along with some minecraft.

OneWiseWizard,https://www.leafly.com/indica/303-og/reviews/1352506,"“Just vaped this in my crafty, love it. More calming strain. No anxiety which is good. It reminds me of the purple cotton strain. Can tell its a strain for after work or just decompressing. Some strains get you hyped up like you just took adderall or something, this is more of a single beer type strain. Just relaxed. Wife told me to write that she's "straight chilling."”"

Yeah, it's not going to put you into orbit, but it has an aftertaste that reminds me on fruit loops and gives me a mellow and relaxing high. Good night time strain that will certainly help with insomnia and will ease your stress.  if you have had a rough day, light up some 303 and Fuhgettabout it! This is certainly my favorite for chillin'.”"

scarletstrider,https://www.leafly.com/indica/303-og/reviews/1148061,"“good relaxed high. Kind of a combination of mostly happy and relaxed. Good way to take the edge off, but if your looking to get fucked up this isn't your strain. You also get pretty damn tired at the end. You can get pretty angsty smoking this but it passes.”"

backtoarms,https://www.leafly.com/indica/303-og/reviews/1366865,"“It's a 5-star in terms of potency. Rec shop said this is an 80/20 indica dom but it def felt more to me like 70/30 or 60/40 indica. Great bud, just didn't expect such sativa properties in it. 
And this particular batch was not flushed thoroughly enough before harvest. Rough smoke and sizzling cherry. Top shelf too.”"

Very potent taste on inhale. High isnt really strong enough mentally for me personally unless i smoke say 2 bowls. Probably a great strain in a low stress situation but not a constantly stressful environment.  Overall it's a good strain and very flavorful.”"

I found that this is a great strain to put with a really hyper sativa like Zeta Sage #1 from the same dispensary.  It gives you a very good creative and hyper feeling where you just want to get some creative shit DONE!  Granted, I'm into the Dewars a little too, I'm guess I'm saying the three are a good combo.”"

Super tasty! Has a sweet (honey/berry/caramel?) twang on top of classic Kush "fuel" aroma from my PAX vaporizer (get one). Heavy indica body stone but with lighter, uplifting, introspective head high. Cried most of the way through a Planet Earth II episode cuz it was so beautiful. Eliminates pain, mild munchies, good zzz”"
