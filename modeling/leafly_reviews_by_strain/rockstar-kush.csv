petethekoala,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar-kush/reviews/1417383,"“Had Rockstar OG around new year. Had a lot of stressful moment at that moment that prevented me from sleeping well until I met that strain! It kills the stress, anxiety, pain and put you to sleep right away in 30 minutes to and hour and 15 minutes. Taste Earth, Sweet and hoppy/skunky pine. Definitely a night strain so avoid for the day but so good!”"
ConceptProductions,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar-kush/reviews/1409997,"“Super pungent skunky smell, with the classic spicy kush finish from it's bubba parent. Really sticky, dense, resinous buds with a thick coat of crystals. Very strong, BC Rockstar is definitely not for the beginner smoker, but is a good appetite stimulant, and good for those who need strong medication for pain and insomnia.”"
wadewestwhy,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar-kush/reviews/1333617,"“I had Rockstar OG and I find myself always come back to this strain for my night time sessions. It packs a really strong punch like most favoured indica's. I would say the benefits of this strain are for insomnia, stress, anxiety, OCD, and just generally slowing you down. I have bipolar 2 disorder, so this was good for my racing thoughts. I did attempt to smoke this during the morning and day time and I would not rec...”"

CannabisCritic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/rockstar-kush/reviews/1409998,"“A superb indica for evening and night time use. This strain will have you feeling relaxed in no time, and provides a slight but noticeable euphoria. There do not appear to be any apetite stimulating effects, (only mildly in large doses). A pleasant smelling strain with deep earth and skunk characteristics, finishing with a slight woody fragrance. Overall a solid choice for anyone looking for an imdica that won't have...”"

Another spice rack strain, dressed to the toes in a glorious amounts of terpenes. This strain is not for the first time smoker, or the inexperienced - the hits are bountiful, very expansive in the lungs and packs one wallop of a psychoactive punch to the noggin. This one strain DESTROYS my depression - i simply CAN NOT be sad on it. On my worst day...”"

The Rku was the last one I tried because of some of the negative reviews of it. Let me tell you though, this was the best of them all. Although the reviews led me to believe this was a serious Indica, the reality for me was that it is truly an Indica for daytime and not really a night time couch...”"

Upon consumption a feeling of relaxation blankets the entire body, leaving you in a pain free sedative state. A tremendously bold aroma that's smells of fuel at first, however strong citrus hints of lemon and lime are also present. The taste has a sharp floral flavour that is typical of kush, and is paired with a lovely lemon u...”"

It was great for getting rid of the pain I experienced from working out, great for inflammation and made me very, very calm for an extended period of time (6 - 8 hours). I would highly recommend this strain for...”"

But it doesn't stop there, It's got a very powerful high to it as well. It's also very sticky stuff probably one of the easiest strains to roll up a nice fatty with. Super relaxing, great to sit back and listen to your favorite music and just enjoy yourself.”"

I was very observant and paid attention to detail. My boyfriend however remembered things that we thought he forgot about. Salty foods does not taste good with this. Hunger was increased very little and the tip of my tongue was tingly. After about 2 hours it started making us very tired. Woke up feeling refreshed.”"
