Pie Face OG
=============
mattykooty,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pie-face-og/reviews/1383960,"“this beautiful beast lures you in with a dark cherry tartness and sweat-tea notes, and then proceeds to immediately melt your face. this is a full on giggly weird high. you'll notice a little slowness and you might feel cross-eyed but no couch lock. Not the most beautiful to look at but the effects, aroma and taste make up for it.  I love it and it is becoming a favorite.”"
BudtenderWoody,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pie-face-og/reviews/1353205,"“PIE FACE (HYBRID) 
	
Pine aroma with a slight cherry scent, guessing high Humulene/A-Pinene terpening profile.
	
Diesel skunk aroma on bud breakup.
	
Sugar taste on the tongue after exhale, may be the cherry.
	
Light smooth pine flavor inhaling, non-harsh smoke. 
	
Instantly felt more focused after one toke (30 seconds)
	
Energetic but not edgy/fidgety feeling.
A great strain for more focused energetic feeling....”"

This powerful hybrid has notes of peanut, strawberry, cherry, and a slight kush taste. The buds are so beautiful and the smell alone will make you love this strain. Prefect for day or night, so all around great strain that makes you very social while also giving you a great relaxing body buzz. Highly highly recommen...”"
blueyedmule,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pie-face-og/reviews/1344301,"“Fifty year old weed virgin again. As an addendum to my prior review, I tried this strain again and this time ended up eating the planet. Some blogs are saying this is a "skinny weed". Well, maybe. This time, not so much. I think it was worth at least an extra 1000 calories intake. If that matters to you, this strain is a hit/miss. You might try Double Dream, I just had that this morning before my bedtime (daysleeper)...”"
Alacrity,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pie-face-og/reviews/1682573,"“This strain is in my top 5- the cherry pez-like aroma and flavor are misleading as the effects can be overwhelming if caution is not shown. The first draws and exhale are filled with tart, sweet cherries and grapefruit citrus, and you can't help but take one more just for the taste- but if over indulged, a nap is in your immediate future. Titration is key, and going slow will make all the difference between functioni...”"

This strain is fine. It has a lovely, herbal flavour to it. In small doses, it's a fun and euphoric high. It increases my interest in being social, as well. Larger doses knock me right out. It's middle-of-the-road, for me; nothing exceptional.

It should be noted that I probably have a lower than average tolerance.”"
