TehMilkMan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/pine-cone/reviews/1535984,"“Real good Sativa for activities!  I hit some after a workout and it keeps my body relieved while not knocking me out, as I like to stay active.  If you use a vape, hit it at higher (400°F) Temps to get smacked with euphoria, creativity, and a real numbing buzz. Tastes of "forests" and "pine".”"
