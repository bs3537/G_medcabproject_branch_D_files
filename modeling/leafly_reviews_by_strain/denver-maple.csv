MyJokerHandStayLIT,https://www.leafly.com/indica/denver-maple/reviews/1358982,"“Starts with a heavy yet not too heavy body buzz. The perfect body buzz to be exact. Slowly your mind melts and becomes a wonderfully relaxed land of good thoughts and smiles. Soon after smoking wanted to laugh and had no reason, this is some high quality. Great for relaxation of the mind and body. For ptsd and anxiety and stomach pain I can say this is a go to. Kinda psychedelic behind everything as well, almost like...”"

tataymx,https://www.leafly.com/indica/denver-maple/reviews/1266702,"“My all-time favorite strain.
Amazing smell, and the flavor gets me nuts!
Strong body high and highly sedating.”"
Tvdub93,https://www.leafly.com/indica/denver-maple/reviews/1380457,"“Really lung expanding, almost a mix of earthy and pine like flavor with hints of rejuvenating citrus to keep your palette wondering what's going on.”"
MapleGumby,https://www.leafly.com/indica/denver-maple/reviews/1219309,"“One of the best highs I have ever been able to enjoy. High hallucinogen, high euphoria and really deep thoughts. Great for enjoying in nature, I think I looked at a yellow and red changing tree for an hour.”"

patco,https://www.leafly.com/indica/denver-maple/reviews/1177781,"“I've been happily surprised by this strain. I don't understand why the rating is only a 3.7!?”"
SirPlatypus,https://www.leafly.com/indica/denver-maple/reviews/1172514,"“Definitely deserved the award as far as effects and potency, the taste was slightly earthly for my taste but was purely genetic and not a result of a bad cure. Downright incredible flowers, I loved the uplifting giggly mood that a bowl put me in. Found a great place by Gem Lake in Estes Park, to sit and enjoy the view and some Denver Maple. It was worth the 12 hour drive across the Midwest just to pick up an eighth.”"
