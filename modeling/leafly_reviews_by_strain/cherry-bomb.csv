Cherry Bomb
=============
maktown,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-bomb/reviews/1412057,"“Cherry Bomb is definitely one of the most powerful highs I've ever had. I can only compare the high to the idea of your head bouncing off the walls like a ping pong ball. Some strains make you relaxed, euphoric, and sedated. Whereas this strain sort of throws your brain to Pluto. These are all good things. I would save Cherry Bomb for a special occasion when you want to get wasted.

It's a fairly new strain here in L...”"
TurnThatShitUp,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-bomb/reviews/1385904,"“Creative, focused, energetic high. I found myself banging out music and slinging witticisms at everyone - made me feel like I wanted to have fun, if that makes sense. Highly recommended for creative types that do not want a body high (I felt none whatsoever) or anyone that wants a focused, energetic boost for daytime use.”"
RickReade,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-bomb/reviews/1376191,"“Without doubt one of the best strains i've smoked to date. I'm a long-time sufferer from depression and stress and this strain has helped me control those issues. The smoke is also a highlight, I tend to vape and the sweet cherry/berry flavour that comes through is exceptional!”"
imnotsethrogen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-bomb/reviews/1351354,"“Great daytime weed. The high comes on quick and only last 45-60 minutes in lower amounts. Time really slows down. Makes the 45 minutes feel like 145. The high lasts longer with more consumption. Definitely versatile in how and why and where you could use it. Pretty functional high. Probably could use this at work pretty successfully under small doses.”"

Beroni,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-bomb/reviews/1381649,"“Where to begin?  The smile that comes out of nowhere and makes your face hurt.  The energy to get things done and the clarity to not screw then up.  This strain was perfect for my depression and anxiety and is my favorite after trying at least a hundred strains.  I love you Cherry Bomb!”"
Martyr88,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-bomb/reviews/1307759,"“One of my Favorite strains, Awesome taste very sweet flavor and aroma, full body high accompanied with a great head high.

***** What I got. was California outdoor grown, organic 'CHERRY BOMB'.
Rare these days, but I digress...

It was, addictive, I don't know how else to say it. My buddy ripped me off, for this strain!!! No kidding LOL.

The buds were red and solid and sativa all the way.

MissMegaton,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cherry-bomb/reviews/1393264,"“This strain is a weaker hybrid- the bit I bought came in at just under 10% THC.
