Pharoh,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/kali-dog/reviews/1389318,"“3 phenos out of a 3 pack of beans. each very different. pheno 1 was a moderately yielding indica dominant specimen, it tasted exactly how it i thought it should have and took 9 weeks. Phenos 2 and 3 was too crap to bother talking about.”"
