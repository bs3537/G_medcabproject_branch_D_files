I am diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, minor PTSD, and previous Psychological disorder. Basically I have a lot of stress and depression and this is a very nice strain that clears my head and gives me a mellow, uplifting sensation when I'm down. Great for watching Cheech and Chong Up in Smoke ;)”"

Sativa boost out of the gate followed by waves of crazy uber-hunger and heavy eye lids. I managed to fight off the urge to sleep and motivated once again to my guitar. In the end it was slumbers battle.”"
