It really helps with muscle cramps/soreness. I've also had it help a headache. I have high blood pressure, and it lowered my blood pressure down to around 110/60.

Sativa dominant hybrid, but overindulge and you will be a bit sleepy after a while. Definitely a versatile strain, but either way the high is amazing through and through. A bit of a creeper, so take time between puffs, especially dabs. 

As a flower it's a bit more of a true hybrid, but as wax and rosin dabs, the high will defi...”"

It takes everything the Girl Scout Cookies phenotype has to offer and adds layer of depth that sets this apart from any other strain. It's like the best baked dessert you could ever imagine, but only smokable, and it's effects are infinitely better for your body.

Went with the former, and it became our main strain for the next week.  We generally keep our intake down to a minimum, and Cookies and Cream delivered quite wallop.

I found the high to be happy, functional, and a bit talkative. I had a much better experience with this version of cookies and cream then I had from previous experiences.It's a good strain for walking around and talking or being social etc. 

Flavors I got were woody and honey.”"

Taste : persistent fruity sweet taste with thick vanilla like aftertaste. Excellent flavor. Thick smoke. 
Visual : crystalline calyxes and fibrous red intertwined with bright green dense buds
Effects : mild relaxing herb, indica calming effects without being too heavy.  creativity  increases - also a very talkative strain. Good for deep thi...”"

jimmyinspazzz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cookies-and-cream/reviews/1608197,"“My feelings could go either way with this strain.  There is not much to it honestly in regards to substance.  The buds are average reminding me a lot of beasters with same uniform shape of a little turd.  One thing to note in a positive regard is that the flower is perfect for rolling joints.  Nuggets being that perfect middle ground between fluffy and super dense that crumble between your fingers like flour.  This i...”"

Stress becomes smoke that wisps away from my skin and a nice euphoria settles in as I become lighter.  Smoked the flower in a water bong and the rips were smooth with few coughing fits.  Worth a try if your local has it in stock.”"

This strain gives you a really even 50/50 split, with the 'head high' first. Definitely made me chatty for a few hours and then I slept pretty good afterwards. 

I prefer Sativa's, so this hybrid was good for staying active and giving you energy. If
you're looking to zone out and get 'dumb', look somewhere else. This strain w...”"

I have severe anxiety and migraines and need strains that manage that but leave me clear headed and focused so I can be functional.
