HashOilStrainReview,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-11/reviews/1234554,"“This strain is a great uplifting and motivational high. It just makes you want to exercise and get things done. You will definitely not have to worry about being couch-locked, as this will just make you want to be doing something every minute. The taste is out of this world, due to its sweet flavor and how smooth it is when vaped. Just remember a little goes a long way with this 2011 Cannabis Cup winner for best sati...”"

It's my favorite sativa, hands down. Perfect aware, functioning high but I still feel that goofy energy that good sativas always have. The taste and smell are to die for. I am smelling it right now as I type this and it is AMAZING. Very skunky sweet (my favorite) and also citrusy. It tastes more l...”"
PDXSister,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-11/reviews/1304641,"“Great for during the day. I find it is great for pain and anxiety about completing or starting things. It gives a very mellow buzz that enhances my motivation and productivity. I don't find that it increases my appetite. It is a very smooth vape that doesn't make me cough or give me headaches.”"

The strain is a great daytime medicine with a slightly sweet distinct recognizable odor.The plant has a high pistil-to-leaf ratio, and can't forget that it is a cannabis cup winner”"
gfolder,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-11/reviews/1392879,"“today's strain is a new from my dispensary called Bay 11. a genuine sativa that has quite a punch, i call this a slick punch. definitely worth the buck for your bang. in this slick piney flavor, moist, even a hint of fresh forest smell, you can feel a high that takes you somewhere. and while i may be describing my high, i can clarify. You get a calm high with no desperation from puff to puff, I vaporized on the Magic...”"

anxiety425,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-11/reviews/1659106,"“Definitely a good pick me up for the morning. Like adding an extra shot of espresso to your coffee. Good for someone that loves Sativa but wanna try something new without many different effects. Diesely pungent, citrus undertones. Be prepared to cough heavy from this strain. The high kinda starts to lower your eyes followed by hard cerebral waves.”"

NSomniac,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/bay-11/reviews/1246438,"“I wish there were more strains like this. It has a very different flavor it's earthy but sweet almost like a tea flavor. The high is great almost perfect for daytime work week use. You get incredibly stoned while still being able to focus on what needs to get done.

Great cerebral uplifting high, low CBD percentage so more of a fun/stress/munchies strain than a pain killing muscle relaxing effect.
