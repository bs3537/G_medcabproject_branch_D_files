oldfartincanada,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/dutch-dragon/reviews/1412428,"“This is the second straight-up Sativa that I've smoked. It burns like a 5-alarm fire in the back of your throat. Harsh as hell, but that harshness just reminds you that you can't reach weed-Valhalla without experiencing a bit of pain. Very fast-acting stuff. Unlike Strawberry Cough, another Sativa I have tried, this one gives you a head high and a full body high. I have severe chronic lower back pain from two herniat...”"

This hit so hard, so beautiful and dreamy, that the only thing I could do was sit on the floor and listen to music. It had a citrusy flavor for sure. It elevated my mood and gave me a ridiculous amount of creativity. I was not artist, but after sitting I ended up drawing for an hour. Highly recomm...”"

Gives you a very nice body, and head stony feeling. Not to strong, but definitely satisfying. I personally haven't noticed any significant negatives to this strain. Besides a pesky cotton mouth, no abnormal effects. Paranoia, head aches, and anxiety are not anything i have noticed, though I do have friends who occasionally com...”"

I can tell you I have smoked the best of all kinds and this particular sativa is excellent for energy. One small downfall is when you come down there can be a slight headache included.

Works wonders on stress, anxiety and pain. Intense high that is unusualy for pure sativas but had no couch lock sensation. This is a strain that you could use with moderation anytime of the day, but it certainly makes a relaxed and fun evening strain.”"
