The flowers are a beautiful mix of green and purple buds.  When ground, the dark purple mixture is a delight to the eyes. The smoke is a little harsh but relief is felt immediately. The shatter is a beautiful amber color and tastes so delicious. The sweet taste of terpenes in the shatter dance around in the pallet for a tasty treat. All ...”"

Chitownflower,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mag-landrace/reviews/1502379,"“This is by far one of the best strains in Illinois. In a state new to legal cannabis there are very few unique strains. Ataraxia/Goldleaf is setting the bar high with strains like Mag Landrace. Great tasting indica that will help chronic pain and help you sleep.”"
dldream,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mag-landrace/reviews/1485006,"“Great indica!! One of my favorite strains to medicate with. I suffer from anxiety and PTSD and use this strain to treat them. I only gave it 4 of 5 stars because a lot of times the buds are dense but a good amount of stems. All that said still in my top 3 along with Alien Rock Candy and Alien Bubba.”"
Evan38,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mag-landrace/reviews/1594304,"“Wow!! This is an awesome strain! It reminds me of the imported hash that would come around once in a while in the early 90s. I have been trying to get this strain for about 2 months but it has been flying out of every dispensary in the state. I was lucky enough to score the last 2G's in the dispensary today 😁. My pain level was fairly high before I hit this tonight. After taking about 6 hits I was feeling significan...”"
Qliks,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mag-landrace/reviews/1616718,"“I tend to lean more toward Sativas and Hyrbids, but this
Mag Landrace (from Verano) REALLY caught me off guard. The nugs are so beautiful I almost felt bad grinding them! Beautiful hues of purple and trichomes galore, this is a wonderful flower.

When smoked, it definitely has a somewhat sweet note to it on the exhale and a more “Indica-like Earthy-tone” on the inhale. It caught me off guard because it did not hit me...”"

ebrodkorb,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mag-landrace/reviews/1531006,"“This is my favorite strain at the moment. The feeling is very calming and relaxing. I like it most for the feeling it gives compared to other strains. I prefer indicas to sativas and this one does not give me couch lock or a headache like sativas can.  I also like the flavor. It is almost like Lemon Pinesol cleaner. Very refreshing.”"
CannabisConnoisseurs,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mag-landrace/reviews/1626123,"“FIRST THINGS FIRST! I’ve been consuming cannabis for 15+ years and this is by far my ALL TIME FAVORITE STRAIN! In a close second with Veranos PURPLE PUNCH! This stuff is AMAZING when it comes to pain relief and insomnia. Ok here’s what the growers at VERANO have to say about this miraculous strain.

CRX778,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mag-landrace/reviews/1606410,"“Strong, strong indica. It was highly recommended to me by the staff at my dispensary so when it was included in a 5-strain trial pack I went for it. I would buy this again on its own. It definitely packs a punch but it's good on days I'm home or am in need of stronger pain management. 4 stars only because I'm not a fan of the taste and the draw is consistently too harsh for my liking.”"
wayniac917,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mag-landrace/reviews/1599575,"“Talk about crippling relaxation. Don't plan on doing ANYTHING on this strain. From the second you hit it the effects set in immediately. Relaxing, happy since of well being. COUCH LOCK warning! Plan on watching a movie or some Youtube videos because you're not going to be doing anything after smoking this strain. Great for pain, stress or insomnia. I would buy this again in a heartbeat!”"
BigFattyHooter,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mag-landrace/reviews/1621048,"“Illinois meds. Dense, white coated purple buds with vibrant orange hairs that look super cool on the purple. This is easily top shelf stuff. It works for pain well. I feel very good on this strain. One of the best I've seen at the dispensary so far in 3 years. 
Only thing is...$60 is steep for an 8th of flower. After 3 years, top shelf 8ths should be $40-$45. It hurts me to pay this much.”"
ChiTownConnoisseur,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mag-landrace/reviews/1593058,"“Despite being small buds, she is a dense and pretty strain. The terps were a bit muted but the effect was on point. There is a lot of good new cultivators in IL, this one trends towards the middle of the pack.”"
escoemartinez,https://www.leafly.com/indica/mag-landrace/reviews/1699082,"“The first time I smoked this I was literally glued to the couch. Lucky for me I work in a dispensary and was required to journal my experience, if that was not the case I would have stayed on the couch in that same position for the entirety of the hi. This strain for me is specifically for sleep, if I wake up at 3 am im asleep by 3:45 with the assistance of this strain.”"

Usually, I tend towards the sativas, but the Mag Landrance is my favorite indica by far.  I've had flower and pre-rolls and it's definitely a go-to strain!

This is what cannabis was supposed to be before it was inbred to hell in the prohibition era. Can be quite potent, so definitely take it slow.”"
