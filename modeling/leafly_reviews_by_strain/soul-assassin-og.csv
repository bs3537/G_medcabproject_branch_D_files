Alexander68,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/soul-assassin-og/reviews/1367554,"“I'm more of a sativa smoker and knew it was an Indica-dominant strain, I didn't think I would like it, but after trying this strain out since I've seen some good things about it, I was impressed from the beginning to the end. I picked up the flower through online delivery so I wasn't expecting anything from a really good batch, as well as yet to find out since It was my first time trying it, and I will most definitel...”"
ThaJerm1995,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/soul-assassin-og/reviews/1367552,"“Great body high and this strain is definitely a relaxant. I was numb from my face to my toes. My mind drifted to positive thoughts and I felt sleepy as a Koala. I slept for 12 hours and woke up feeling relaxed and positive about my day.”"

Very Dense nugs; small, but heavy.
calyx to leaf ratio: 8.5
one hit=good flavour, good lung exspansion. tastes like diesel.
two= almost tasted kushy. good exspansion, but smooth. slight creeping buzz.

DEMoNik623,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/soul-assassin-og/reviews/1367557,"“Very Dank smelling. An almost Diesely smell. Taste is phenomenal. Down to the last hit. Would recommend this to any OG or Indica fan.”"
Certafarm420,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/soul-assassin-og/reviews/1371160,"“The batch I got was great! Light green, with purple hues. Nice coat of tiny THC glands across the flowers. Smells & tastes fantastic. Definitely notice the hint of lemon Thai , great strain!! Ahhh, very relaxed euphoric HIGH 🍋⛽️🌳🌳🔥😁👍🏼”"
Tsain1,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/soul-assassin-og/reviews/1367553,"“Nice sized buds and equally as dense. I enjoy the high with sweet and a little sour scents. Tris are fully formed the denser the bud IMO. But fluffier bud has better taste. High starts in the head and stays in your eyes for a while. Relax and settle down before smoking this”"
dankmugs,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/soul-assassin-og/reviews/1288552,"“Very euphoric. Smoking on a blunt just about done and I'm tingling & warm. Do not smoke if you got ishh to do, ya hear? Kick back with this”"
LBwreck,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/soul-assassin-og/reviews/1389371,"“"Most people when choosing their medical marijuana generally find a specific species and experiment with strain variants to find what works best for them. For me, Indica dominance for my nighttime medication needs is generally the species I go fo. Sometimes I do prefer a Indica-dominant hybrid, but pure Indica’s tend to work best.

OG’s are known for their heavy stone and couch lock capability, and Soul Assassins i...”"

AllState951,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/soul-assassin-og/reviews/1646985,"“The OG that’s not too OG.
  Most OG’d hit hard, knocking you to the couch and or bed. Leaving you sleeping well into the night without even knowing it. S.A isn’t that in reality. Smoke this and you are relieved of stress as you feel relaxed. But sleepy is not what you feel. At least not with the flower I am smoking. Still a good flower to relax to. As for me, it didn’t hit hard enough for an indica.”"

chadjeffreyrichard,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/soul-assassin-og/reviews/1298603,"“Great general mood-lifter. Not immediate or intensely so, like Maui Wowie, but in a gentler, more profound way. 

Little to no clouding in thinking. Not what I'd consider an intensely psychoactive strain. Fun for creative work or easing social stress.”"
gustosoycaliente,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/soul-assassin-og/reviews/1251254,"“I got a batch of smaller, medium density buds lab tested 25% THC. The smell is diesel. Beautiful purple calyx with deep orange pistils. Totally encrusted with trichomes. Effect is clear headed and relaxing. Great for winding down at night.”"

I don't know if it was because I tried sungrown or if it was just a bad batch but I didn't get high... The taste was like I just drank pine sol. The buds were embarrassing ugly little fuckers that were literally like porcelain marbles. I shoulda checked the harvest date but I was highly disappointed. 

This experience is why I don't trust testing numbers. ...”"
