OG Shark
=============
nagchampa,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-shark/reviews/1412667,"“Outstanding! I felt almost immediate effects from this excellent strain - the OG Shark was great for pain relief and appetite stimulation. Quelled chronic nausea and enabled me to both cook and eat a good meal. After a small pre-bed toke, I had a great sleep & awoke refreshed. Only downside was a slight anxious/paranoid feeling, but that could have been my mood.  This will for sure be in my Top 10; maybe even my Top ...”"
Yorick,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-shark/reviews/1356512,"“Best high I've had in a while. Smooth flavor, potent effect, makes all the bullshit in life go away! Helps with stress, anxiety, and restoring ones mind if its going too fast or in a bad place. Also good for depression, a powerful uplifting effect.”"
MegaMan,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-shark/reviews/1390159,"“I picked up OG Shark from the dispensary in Vancouver BC, it was grown by Valley Co-op.  This bud is beautiful.  The smell is amazing and difficult to describe, something like earthy fuel.  The smoke is extremely mild on the lungs and tastes great.  The high comes on fairly quick and feels amazing.  It made me feel very euphoric and uplifted, the high is crystal clear and very functional. The strain also gives an exc...”"
rlowe,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-shark/reviews/1356513,"“Wow, Tilray really outdid themselves with this one.  With over 24% THC on the current batch it doesn't take much to get fully medicated with the Shark.  Sleep comes quick and hard though, so I wouldn't consider this a daytime strain by any means.  If you need something that will help you get to sleep this one will definitely do the trick!”"
CriticalYoda,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-shark/reviews/1359808,"“I'm a Tilray user here. And I'm going to give OGShark a 4 Star. And here's why. 

For new users: if you're really looking to be mind blown, this is for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend trying this right off the bat it's pretty potent. I used this product in a volcano vape. A small amount goes a long ways. If you're using this, I'd recommend starting small and just adding as you go. The taste was a bit harsh on th...”"

At one point, I had a muscle above my right ear twitch away rapidly and suddenly stop. After it stopped, it felt like an energy block I wasn't aware of had just been opened.

Lighter flavours, smooth too. OG Kush is powerful enough, this strain is similar but perhaps even more of a head high. I even tried a nap - nope, couldn't do it.”"
sviauz06,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/og-shark/reviews/1330457,"“Its my favourite strain at the moment. A large part of that is the fact that it was grown by Tilray. Their prices are up there, but the quality of the finished cured product is amazing. Smell smacks you in the face at first, then brings an immediate smile. Very pungent, kush smell with a lemon pine twist. Buds were so pretty you felt bad grinding them up. Purple everywhere and trichomes overflowing off every inch. Bu...”"
