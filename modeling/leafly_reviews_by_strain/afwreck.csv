Artistic empathy ratchets up and emotional connectivity to things becomes quite strong. There’s a cozy, wistful, euphoric contentment that’s most strongly felt.

It's definitely a strong head high that is felt fairly quickly. Best part is for those who smoke a whole lot, you'll be able to conserve (if you have the will power) due to the strong effects from such a little amount. Stay Golden!”"
